		<div>what do you think?<br />
just like paladin and sk stats for fighting.<br />
more like harm touch ability.  maybe fire based?<br />
spell lineup.  30ish gets lesser evac and starts getting self gates.  never gets real ports or tls.  lesser evac and evac maybe though.<br />
ice comet at 65 or equivalent.  maybe not but something that damage or around.  not sure how paladins or sk's stack up at that level to their pure casting couterparts.<br />
could prolly balance it pretty easy with paladin and sk.  has dd's instead of heal or dots.  let sk and pal only weapons be used by them and the normal weapons.  should still be plate class if sk is and they are necro hybrid.<br />
could use the same spells as wizards with a couple extras.  probably some form of enchant sword with element spell.  maybe a couple vision spells.  definetly root and one or two stuns.  <br />
i think it would be fun to play.<br />
would be harder to balance but they could make it chain tops and implement some other chain items.  since most are for wis it would make it harder though.  druid shaman i think wear chain so the chain &quot;caster&quot; gear prolly wouldn't work with chain as well.<br />
just think it would be interesting to have that hybrid class.  i know i'd rather play it than another tank hybrid.  <br />
<br />
am taking suggests for names.  current favorite battle mage. war magus has also been suggested<br />
<br />
dislaimer: this idea is not needed in game.  this idea is not meant to cause flames about how stupid this idea is.  I did think this idea through some before i posted.  I dont see a big problem balancing this with paladins and sk.  If you discover one please dont flame me with it but post it nicely.<br />
<br />
the above disclaimer is for the ppl who shoot down suggestions threads with religious fervor.  i just thought this would be a cool thing to discuss.</div>

Don't let an SK or Paladin see you say that.  Both are actually rather good grind tanks... better at keeping aggro than a warrior, and not that far behind on defense or HP.  The lack of Defensive-type discs is what keeps them from being decent raid tanks, too.  And since he said they'd be basing the &quot;new class&quot; off of them, well...<br />

		<div>there's also the minor detail of that wiz dmg stun aggro is more than paladin stun. due to crazy high level mana regen, you'd have a class that, if on hybrid melee level, has i think 130ish melee dps(I am quoting from parse memory) with the addition of say 70/tick mana regen at ratio 5 would do an extra 58 dps. what you're suggesting is, I guess, in a pinch the melee/spell flavor that a mage uses with the exception there's his own melee attacks.<br />
<br />
bards are FAR from being an int caster/war hybrid. the best resists, best mana, only dmg focus, best pulling ability,best run speed... a hybrid has inferior in either of the categories which determine his ability, this doesn't describe available bard abilities- and bards are highly limited in their ability to use their abilities by short song durations. hybrids today are all about aggro; they have numerous other abilities but their aggro is their selling point and their defensive stats aren't too far below a warrior. what this means is that with a hybrid, your group as a whole will take less dmg(think slowing), and your group will do more damage. warriors in the regards to what they bring to a group are totally inferior, which is a balance problem. the thigns brought to a group are offense(group's dps), defense(damage done to the group), and utility. hybrids currently excel in all 3, making the warrior class roughly obsolete in comparison. a wiz/war hybrid could be better than all 3 in raw punching power: wiz stuns are uber aggro too, the dmg `should` be higher, and they'd offer the offense/defense superiorities of another hybrid. I figure with the extra dps they'd be additionally superior in groups, but would lack any useful utilities on a raid. For instance SKs can pull well, and paladins can remove curse + group heal.<br />

		<div>A Battlemage is the easiest class idea to come up with. Everything about it sounds great, but there has to be some reason VI/SOE went with other class idea's since release, like monk and beastlord. Would be sweet though. finaly a tank class that interests me.<br />
<br />
Maybe the problem is that a Battlemage would hold agro a little to well.<br />

Or i wonder if they would end up makeing it a paper tank like rangers.</div>

		<div>I think that this class would be kinda cool to have in a group, and not hard to balance with enough thought.  However, what place could they possibly have on a raid.  As it is, paladins and shadowknights are of limited use on a raid (compared to the core raid classes like warrior, cleric, wizard, rogue).  Dont think that it necessarily wouldn't be fun to play, but I think would have little application outside of the xp group situation.</div>

		<div>This would not work because you'd end up with a class that tanks as well as a paladin/shadowknight holds agro as well or better and can also outdamage a warrior. At the moment paladin/shadowknights tank just below a warrior, can way outperform a warrior when it comes to agro, and do less melee damage then said warrior and maybe consider warriors to be underpowered. Make a class with the same tanking abilities, the same agro abilites and give then powerful offensive magic so they can also easily outdamage a warrior and you're in trouble.<br />

Is a thing of the past. Paladins are great as patch healers for raids where ae is present (seams like there are more and more of those) and also tied for #1 choice for offtanking to help CC.

		<div>hybrids own! if you really use them, the hybrids will be tanking more than the warriors. the only exception is boss mobs, and it's extremely unlikely to go past needing 3 wars on a single boss fight(exceptions are noteworthy: shei comes to mind). they offtank, help with mezz aggro, grc, group heal, buff, pull, and are even required for one encounter. hybrids, where they survive, are superior to warriors in any raid situation- this is granted that they do nto survive 3k hits too well!</div>

I didn't say they're completely useless.  Only that they are limited use.  Yes, they have situations where they can be valuable, but for the most part there in whatever situation on a raid there is another class that can do it the same or better.  A raid with no paladins or shadowknights could function better than a raid with no clerics, wizards, or warriors.<br />
<br />
As far as hybrids being able to tank on all but bosses, personally I think this is sad.  Warriors have had the one thing they had going for them taken away, and I pity them.  Any more inflation of gear without a lot of balancing, and the warrior class will be all but obsolete.</div>

Let's go step by step on a rathe raid with no hybrids:<br />
1) setting up is done<br />
2) mezzed rathes are pulled, and cc'd 1 by 1<br />
3) offtanked rathe is pulled<br />
4) offtanked rathe is moved away from camp<br />
5) offtanked rathe(it's by a war) turn on healers and kills healers<br />
6) offtanked rathe kills offtank<br />
7) offtanked rathe begins summoning people<br />
8) offtanked rathe kills your entire raid because you had to use a war that is not very strong because you have no paladies<br />
<br />
coirnav can be done entirely without warriors.<br />
<br />
on xegony, you need 1 warrior, every other warrior is totally useless next to a paladin. on one of our raids, a hybrid(we're talking about situations where you do not see summoned wiz etc) has parsed at taking as much as 15 times less damage from mobs, and the dps directed to those mobs is around 1.8 times as much as if being tanked by a war. when hybrids exclusively were used, enchanters did not take damage from the mobs after they were all CC'd. a paladin with some 9400 hps tanked an unslowed spider boss durign an early raid which was severely bad, and took 40dps from it. hybrids there offer vastly more than what a war can. sure, he is not critical on xegony but a hybrid there makes an incredible difference to a good raid force. furthermore I'd heard of paladins tanking xegony herself. while a war would definately take less dps from her and hold aggro no differently than a hybrid, it's certainly been feasible before(I've seen screens of pallies tanking xegony anyway).<br />
<br />
the thing about wars is that your #1 tank is a premium, the ones behind him generally don't get much action, and only will if he's absent or down. they are only needed for bosses, too. while hybrids don't fill any required role, they fill a massive range of other roles which improve your performence and success. warriors do not touch on those roles like a hybrid. they've got 1 job, which is sad, but it's true. even worse, only one person can be doing that job at any given time. boss mob tanking, which is designed around warriors. of course wars want their class changed. the only way to do this is to find some way to effect everything except raid boss mobs(they're dependent on a broken class. fix the class and you break the dependency).<br />

hybrid use is FAR from limited. it is wide ranging, immensely useful. replace a war with a hybrid on any raid and you'll find a massive leap in dps if he survives. NO class offtanks better than a hybrid. there's now a raid which has hybrids as a required class. this is silly, sure. it's true, though, and it's no different than a war. the wasted hybrid is one that isn't being used to his potential. I have seen hybrids like this and wondered at the point to their existence. it's like a wizard whos sole goal in life is to be a coh link. all the good parts of a class... meaningless.<br />
<br />
these days, hybrids really do own.</div>

		<div>make it a chain class.  heck i go all 'vashanti mode' often and dig out the elven chainmail so its not like there isn't a precident (sp?).  stop comparing it to a knight and think more along the lines of a ranger imo...</div>

		<div>I think a battle mage / warrior wizard can work but you would need to have trade offs, either alow them to not have very good spells and wear halph decent armor or very little armor but more spells.<br />
<br />
I think a light armor wearing  duel weilding warrior that can cast verious self only telaports maybee be able to summon the lower end familiars only and have some ice fire and magic based spells that cast realy fast for combat but have large reuse timers could work.  Now sence he wouldn't be wearing much armor hes a ranger waiting to happen but make his damage spells low agro and some high high agro for when he wants it and let him use the concusion spell.  Also let him use all the wizard buffs for resists armor and runes.  Sence hes a warrior wizard that focuses on melle, these spells would be important for him to study.<br />
<br />
Also give him some roots no snares and no AE's.  I think that would make a good combo.</div>

		<div>It should not be a plate class, nobody would take one of the other 3 tanking classes over a Tankmage because they would tank as well but not do as much damage.. and if its a chain class.. well there is already ranger as offensive melee ...</div>
