Ok. Once again, the old fucks do not understand what's coming, and how absolutely obsolete they are.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a hint to anyone who thinks millenials are self absorbed:<br />
<br />
The coddled generation is you, fuckers. Specifically the &quot;Bosses&quot; so the Baby Boomers. You got coddled into thinking hard work fucking mattered. Hard work is for fuckups who can't produce results. Results matter. You, as a generation, don't produce results. I know this from <b>every single job I have worked</b> and a general glance at the <b>utterly reeling economy you left my generation</b>. Maybe 100 of you, total, have done something mildly memorable. My generation has to look back to BEFORE YOU ASSHOLES BECAME IMPORTANT to see anything worth emulating. Your greatest contribution to American culture was nationwide mass drug addiction and injecting it into hollywood culture so hard that it became acceptable to actively defend as normal. Good fucking job you goddamn hippies! <br />
<br />
Your generation is too incompetent to use a computer and therefore is incapable of actually producing anything relevant to the world economy. I do, personally, more work than four of you combined, with automated scripts. So do all of my peers. I don't even need a robot to do your job, a quad core will suffice. They're like $100. You get paid what, 150k? Man, no wonder the last 10 years have been layoff heavy. You're fucking useless ass can't even outperform a chip I can mass produce. The soulless bureaucracy built to grind a human into machinery has been replaced by actual machinery. We're not stupid enough to fall behaving in a way that puts us in a job that won't exist in three years.<br />
<br />
You bitch about parents calling the workplace? OUR PARENTS ARE YOU, THESE PEOPLE ARE YOUR GENERATION! THIS IS SOMEHOW OUR FAULT AS A GENERATION? Thankfully, my parents aren't morons and don't do this but don't try to pin this shit on my age group, this is all more of the baby boomer generation being the most inadequately pathetic group of vaginal discharge in modern history. The kid is not the problem in helicopter-parent-land. It's the helicopter parent. You go talk to your own father and make him behave. See how that works. I have no fucking method of leashing my elders.<br />
<br />
Also, what the fuck is with hiring consultants to &quot;Understand millenials&quot;. How about you fucking learn something yourself you generation of quote referencing unenlightened assholes. We're happy to talk with you. You'll probably learn something, you uneducated scrub. It's not fucking hard to keep us engaged: don't treat us like you're an angry parent, and we will continue to outperform the rest of your workforce while half-awake and yawning. We sound self important because when it comes to meeting time and we're talking about shit we got done this week, our list is three times as long as yours and any one item is probably more complicated than your entire week's worth of work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Moral of story: Old fucks are ignorant, and obsolete. You have no place in the competitive workforce, and the best you can hope for is that we don't dump social security as soon as we get enough members of congress from our age group because we sure as fuck don't feel like we need it and you've been calling us names our entire adult lives. Enjoy your retirement - it'll be as sweet for us as it was when we punched the schoolyard bully in the goddamn nose for the first time. We'll make it as painful as bloody possible.<br />
<br />
I'm not self absorbed. I'm fucking horrified by the slime that my progenitors are and genuinely think you are all inferior. Guess what? I keep proving my opinion right. And in the end, the world doesn't give a shit about your age, your work ethic, or anything else. It just cares about your capability.</div>
