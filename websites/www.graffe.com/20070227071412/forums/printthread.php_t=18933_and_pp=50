			<div><strong>Summary of Utility Suggestions for Wizards</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>I've tried to summarise the suggestions for adding utility to the wizard class from the patch day thread (<a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18737" target="_blank">http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18737</a>).<br />
<br />
The discussion in the patch day thread focused heavily upon the change to the method of reaching the plane of hate, and the erosion over time of the transportation part of the wizard role. The thread reached 18 pages and included a lot of ideas for adding utility to the wizard class as compensation.<br />
<br />
These are not my personal suggestions, they are just copied into one place for convenience. They are individual ideas, roughly sorted into categories. Please feel free to discuss the suggestions or add further ideas.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Transportation to Plane of Hate and Sky</b><br />
<br />
•	Remove the reagent cost for wizards transporting to Hate and Sky<br />
•	Add gate spells to Hate and Sky<br />
•	Add translocate spells to Hate and Sky (recipient must have hate stone)<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>New Transportation Spells (possibly quested) / Transportation Changes</b><br />
<br />
•	New gate spells: Barindu, Chardok, PoTranquility, PoMischief and Western Wastes (or ToV)<br />
•	New port/TL spells: Barindu, PoTranquility, PoMischief, Runnyeye and Western Wastes (or ToV)<br />
•	Change the EJ and Skyfire evacuation spells to ports and add a gate and translocate to these destinations<br />
•	Self-gates to the wizard guilds in Qeynos, Freeport, Neriak, Erudin, Ak'Anon and Gukta (can make these quested)<br />
•	A gate to the Temple of Solusek Ro (quested or worshippers only)<br />
•	A port to the Tower of Solusek Ro (quested or worshippers only or both)<br />
•	Translocate Group and Teleport spells that work with a given location (Plane of Knowledge or Nexus would be most practical, or the original old world spires)<br />
•	MGB AA that would make group ports an AE TL to the cast point<br />
•	A gate spell that turns the caster invisible upon arrival<br />
•	Planar Ascension: Gates/ports/tlocs to some nice locations in PoP and above. Code the level/flag requirements for travel into zones that have them.<br />
•	Ability to translocate or port people to the WIZARD's bind point.<br />
•	Allow us to Decession people out of group with a confirmation box like TL.<br />
•	For omens make more portal locations that won't have books going to them.<br />
•	A second spell in addition to bind affinity that would bind our mind instead of our soul (so wizards could have two bind points).<br />
•	Raid Evacuation (could be problems with accidental raid evacuations though?)<br />
•	Make the landing for the Skyfire port safer (so there's less chance of aggro and chromadracs stripping buffs on landing)<br />
•	Make it possible for wizards to bind in more locations - not just cities (wizard-only ability)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Anti-Gate Spell / Anti-Summon Spell / Silence Spell / Highsun Spell</b><br />
<br />
•	Anti-gate spell: Back in PoP beta there were ideas for an anchor sort of spell we could cast on mobs that would stop them from gating - I think we'd all like to see that actually make it to live, would give us a lot more utility use in raids and groups. This would go a long way to making people happy about our utility functions. (Gemdiver's words)<br />
•	Anti-summoning spell: A spell that stopped a mob from summoning for a certain amount of time<br />
•	A silence spell: It would stop the mobs from casting any spells, but it doesn't stop them from meleeing. For it to be worthwhile it would have to have one or more of the following:<br />
a) harder to resist than stun, or work on stun immune mobs<br />
b) longer duration than stun<br />
c) faster recast than stun so it could be chained more effectively<br />
•	Highsun spell: Ability to &quot;Highsun&quot; Mobs to their binds with an Aggro Wipe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Damage Shields and Targetable Weapon Proc Spells</b><br />
<br />
•	Improve the O'Kiels damage shield line - significant damage increase.<br />
•	Group O'Kiels damage shield spells.<br />
•	A damage rune: Like the wizard skin rune only it's also a damage shield until its hit points are exhausted. Or a targetable damage rune with no protective component, but still has the mega damage shield until the hit points cap is reached? Long recast so we couldn't keep it up all the time.<br />
•	Targetable Xuzl-proc spell (not specified how this would work)<br />
•	Targetable weapon proc: a spell to cast on a melee character that adds a significant proc to their weapon (e.g. fire procs for high damage, ice procs for frequent procs with lower damage, magic procs for medium damage with a stun). Higher spells in the line proc for more damage and/or more often. Stacks with existing weapon procs. <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Group Spells</b><br />
<br />
•	Group Spell Shield<br />
•	Group Calrena/Alendar<br />
•	Extend Flappy benefits to the entire group<br />
•	Group Harvest<br />
•	Endurance buff<br />
•	Spell-haste buff (self-only - or maybe a targetable one like the cleric line?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Invisibility Spells</b><br />
<br />
•	Group Invisibility<br />
•	Targetable Improved Invisibility<br />
•	Combined Invisibility and See Invisibility spell<br />
•	Invisibility AA: automatic invisibility upoon landing after a gate/port/translocate. It could have 3 levels (First level would only invis you upon landing after a gate. 2nd level would invis you and your group upon landing after a port. 3rd level would invis people upon landing from a TL).<br />
•	Phase Shift: Self-Target only. The wizard phases in and out of current time/space, allowing them move undetected by all creatures.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Knock / Shatter Lock Spell</b><br />
<br />
•	Knock / Shatter Lock spell: to open locked doors - a spell which allows the wizard to focus great energy, shattering open a locked door.<br />
•	Short group teleport to the other side of a locked door.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Combination Effect Spells</b><br />
<br />
•	Phase Lock: Single Target. An NPC is locked in between time/space rendering them motionless unable to be attacked/or attack.<br />
•	A spell that places a mob in a layer of Ice, effectively mezzing the MoB until the ice is shattered or melted.<br />
•	Temporal Disruption Spell: a spell line that is a nuke and a cast time increaser for targets 12% 25% 50% think of it as a spell based slow opposite to melee slow?<br />
•	Ice nuke with a percentage based slow 15% slow builds on each cast till 60%<br />
•	Fire nuke with a burn down after effect (dot)<br />
•	Magic nuke with a mana tap on casters mobs<br />
•	Frost Flame - Fire nuke with a cold debuff built in debuff is a 3 tick duration dot<br />
•	Burning Frost - Cold Nuke with a Fire debuff built in debuff is a 3 tick duration dot<br />
•	Coldsnap- AE cold based root<br />
•	AE fog (possibly for PvP)<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Eye of Zomm Spells</b><br />
<br />
•	Improved Eye of Xomm: improve duration and allow eye to swim (possibly equal to casters swimming skill).<br />
•	Targetable eye of Xomm (i.e. give another player their own temporary eye)<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Reflect Spells</b><br />
<br />
•	It was suggested that they are not very useful in their current format or only of rare situational use.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Stuns and Xuzl</b><br />
<br />
•	A Lure-based stun: that works on high level mobs for emergency use - could have long recast timer.<br />
•	PBAOE stun<br />
•	PBAOE Xuzl (not sure how this works?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Concussion</b><br />
<br />
•	AE concussion<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Wizard CoTH</b><br />
<br />
•	It fits in with the wizard's transportation role – and could help smaller guilds if another class had the CoTH ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Research</b><br />
<br />
•	Make all GoD spells researchable by wizards<br />
•	Research scrolls: Give research an alchemy like quality, so wizards can make tradable single charge gate scrolls to specific destinations. For example, &quot;Scroll of Alter plane:Hate&quot;: Stone, Quill, Parchent = Right click one charge gate to Hate scroll. <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Manaburn</b><br />
<br />
•	Fix Manaburn (discussed in the wizard top 10 list)</div>

		<div>One comment i'd like to make about the knock/unlock spell suggestion... i like this idea... i play a wizard and a rogue, and would like trap detection, disarming and unlocking to be a larger part of the game... if casters had unlocking spells, the developers could include more things to unlock… there should be more locked doors and chests requiring lockpicking skill or an unlocking spell to open them… rogues would remain superior in the ability, but have more opportunities to exercise it.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to improve and extend the LDoN concept on trap detection, disarming and unlocking to the rest of the game.<br />
<br />

		<div>Where did these ideas come from?  (link please)  It would have been better to just reply with your summary to the original thread.<br />
<br />
While some of the ideas seem fair, many of them wouldn't make any sense being in the hands of Wizards.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'll add my one dream spell to the list:  A Lure-based stun.  I don't care if it has a long recast timer, I don't care if it does any damage.  I just want a stun spell that works on high level mobs that is Lure based for emergency use, and to provide us more versatility.  I miss using stun spells, but at high levels they rarely land and it is very hard to justify the aggro they generate when you could simply be burning the mob down with a regular nuke.</div>

		<div>I think they should add in a ton of teleportation spells but make a lot of them questable, and soloable (However, having a group would help a lot). I think that'd add a lot of fun back into everquest because well, it's putting the quest back into everquest. I'm not much for questing, but I would like to quest for my spells rather then having go on raids to get them. I'll try to post something up when I get back from work and stuffs. I scanned(very quickly) over your summary though. Good job putting it together!</div>

		<div>A long time ago I already offered the possibility to create Runes by a combination of research and pottery.<br />
<br />
- Enchanted clay sculpted into a Runeshape with a mana potion appropiate for the spell level mana requirement.<br />
- Unfired blanco rune is scribed with a rune symbol by combining the unfired blanco rune with the spellscroll and required components in a lexicon.<br />
- Fire rune in a kiln to create a non stackable (No-Drop?) version clickable rune that is charged with 1 charge of that spell. <br />
<br />
Considering the price and amount of mana needed to make the mana potions (enchanter spell line) We would be able to create 1 charge gates, 1 charge nukes, 1 charge whatever spell. As long as it is a Magical spell (WIZ NEC ENC MAG). (Not the Divine Lines CLR DRU SHM)  Some could even be class only, can't have wizards with Mage pets. Although, having a Resurection Rune on you (Necro) would be fun, especially if you failed 10 EE's on the preliminary combines.</div>

I will add, however, a couple of things mentioned that you missed..<br />
<br />
A port/tl/bind in WW in a safe spot near Temple of Veeshan<br />
<br />
Make the Skyfire zone in safer..the druids have a safe spot, no reason not to have one for Wizards.<br />
<br />
Bind in many more locations..unique to wizards..and not just city zones.<br />
<br />
As far as research goes..I have no problem with it, but if it is anything like trying to get the rune of Zephyr, then forget about it for me..</div>

If they give wizards this ability, then they should offer all mages a one time option to turn into wizards.  All their gear would be turned into the wizard equivalent, all their spells would turn into the wizards equivelent.<br />

			<div><strong>Valas i think he ment this for target proc spells</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>Different ideas for spell lines was thinking of a good way to maintain our dps in groups what do you all thing of this ??<br />
<br />
Sphere line - similare to ward spells in its damage idea but implemented better can be cast single target similar to cleric revers damage shields places a wall between mobs and group with various effects<br />
<br />
All spells would be dependent on mele strikes after initial casts against group memeber so would not increase solo power no wizard would want to get hit that much <br />
<br />
Fire Sphere - initial cast is a nuke the nuke sets the starting point for the reverse damage shield for example nuke for 800 after that when mobs are hitting mele it will act as a reverse damage shield spell starts at 800 points and is beat off in increments of 200 points so 800 point initial nuke then mob takes fire damage in waves till the damage is used up 800+600+400+200+100 = 2900 total damage<br />
<br />
<br />
Ice Sphere- Initial cast is a nuke the nuke value sets up the spheres total mitigation (ie 1500 point nuke = 1500 sheild against mele attacks) (2000 nuke = 2000 hp mitigation on mele attacks) .Sphere of spiked ice between group and mob ice = 10% damage mitigation bonus to mele in group and 150pt ds against mob + 15% incremental slow as ice wall is beat off mob slow maxes out at 60% slow ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
example mob is nuked for 2000 mob hits sphere wall and sphere wall takes 400 points of damage mele behind wall takes 360 mob takes 150point ds and is slowed on hitting the wall first time 15% second hit mob hits the wall for 500 takes 150pts of damage mele takes 450 points of damage mob is slowed 30% wall is hit for 500 pints mele takes 450 mob takes 150point ds and is down to 45% mob hits wall for 500 mele in group is hit for 450 mob takes ds of 150hp and is slowed 60% and wall is gone<br />
<br />
150x5=2750 damage total damage<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mystic Sphere- this one is a few possibilites<br />
<br />
wall of magical force either a manasink DS that drains mana on casters <br />
<br />
or a wall that will auto stun the mob as it beats through it<br />
<br />
Again these are all nuke spells cast on the mobs not on group members these are not Damage shields but nukes with revers ds after spell effects<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Different nukes <br />
<br />
super long long range nukes - very slow casting medium to high damage high mana cost <br />
<br />
Fast casting low damage nukes + extreme knock back far far knock back<br />
<br />
medium damage and cast time + stun with spin <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
new ae spell idea<br />
<br />
environmental target AE spells <br />
(homage to merlin)<br />
Frozen mist spell - in pvp will clear the target window and create a fog effect in area around caster will reduce clip plane to those in area to 1% except caster. Caster gets vision buff to see clearly through envionmental effect.<br />
PVE effect cast over group of mobs will lower social aggro 50%. If mobs are already aggro will have a 25% chance to clear mob off aggro ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Root type spell <br />
<br />
ae stasis ae root + levitate when mob is attacked levitate breaks and mob takes falling damage<br />

Agree the latter could be possible - would it work if the box only stayed up a very short time? or if the box could be coded to vanish if the recipient moves?</div>

you can actually do that trick with TL in pop zones by having that person bound outside. if they zone reasonably fast, the puller will not see much difference to this 'exploitable' method. I'm not sure if it's a big problem.</div>

I agree, I don't see how its a big deal.  This is already possible in any zone that you can bind near, and I see nothing game breaking about it.  Just another option.  Besides is it really any different then just using a FD puller?</div>

		<div>Another option regarding the Decession (or Raid Evac) idea...<br />
<br />
How about a flag in the options menu which allows you to be Raid Evacced or Decessioned by anybody in the raid, without a confirmation box. There would be no delay, either you set the flag and you Evac or you set it off and you stay. This would be hard to exploit, and FD classes could set the toggle to off if they wanted to.</div>

why?<br />

how many classes have had things taken from them/nerfed, or had another class gain a similar ability?  so if you duplicate a mage spell, it destroys their entire being?<br />

yeah you can take their spells and turn them into wizard equivalents as soon as wizards can buy GSS in pok, like mages can.  :p <br />

		<div>there are some good ideas in this thread, but the whole coth, or lock picking spells etc. i absolutely hate these ideas!  <br />
<br />
they are abilities which other classes posses, if i wanted to be able to coth, or pick a lock, i would have been a rogue or mage respectively.  <br />
<br />
i dont want to be a coth bitch, i dont want to be responsible for opening doors for other people, i just want to nuke. <br />
<br />
i also dont like the idea of the spell to make its so mobs dont cast spells.  give that ability to enchanters, i dont want to waste my time casting some gimp spell when i could be casting a nuke insted :p  <br />
<br />
as far as i'm concerned, wizards are balanced in groups, we do our damage, and a good wizard can fill many different role's.  we dont need makeshift 'utility spells'  its things like this that blur the class lines, and it will just end up pissing people off imo.  <br />
<br />
how did you feel when pok came out and your porting skills became obsolite?  that's exactly how mages or rogues would feel if we got their abilities.  so ffs, get over yourselves, play the game alittle more, and whine alittle less! please!</div>

<br />
Let's not go crazy here.<br />
<br />
I do think that adding new convinece ports is a great idea.  And an anit-gate/summon spell is cool, and really would fit the wizard class.  But the silence spell?  I don't think so.  If you remember, paladins once had a spell like this, and it was nerfed to hell so fast.<br />

		<div>This is just a summary of all the suggestions on what might be a fair exchange for having one of our two major abilities (porting) given away bit by bit to the entire playerbase until we are no longer needed (for this function) <br />
<br />
It's not a demand for ALL of these to be implemented. It's a list of ideas for SOE to look over and pick one or two out, that might give wizards some group utility.<br />
<br />
And why is it ok to give away pretty much an entire line of our spells (druids' too) but not ok to request a spell that is similar to CotH? It's not as if thats the only thing mages do...we aren't demading the ability to summon all sorts of things like pet toys, focus items, etc, it's just an idea for a spell that fits in with out porting ability.  (See, Mages summon THINGS out of thin air...you'd think summoning people they might accidentally scramble their insides, or something....I've always thought since wizards transport LIVE beings, CotH should have been a wizard ability, but that's just my opinion. And Mages can keep CotH, really :) )<br />
<br />
Or why is it not ok to ask for a magical means to open locks, when it can be justified under the same rationalization that it is &quot;poor game mechanics&quot; to prevent people's access to content just because a certain class (rogues/bards) is not available.  (Just turning SOE's reasoning back on them for a change...what's good for the goose is good for the gander, and all that.)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, spells to suppress mobs gating and/or summoning, would be my preference.  Or a lot more convenience ports &amp; TLs (that are OURS and won't be given away.)  And,  please oh powers-that-be: targettable improved Invis, so we can help the clerics survive the trip to teh GoD trials, hehehe...</div>

				Evacuate upgrades:<br />
Astral Bubble:<br />
Group Root+Invis (SoS-level)+Fade<br />
Cannot be clicked off, duration of 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
This is an evacuate-style spell that doesn't require crawling back to camp. After you cast it, you are stuck waiting around for 2 minutes, so people will only use it in emergencies.<br />
<br />
Astral Sphere:<br />
Same as Astral Bubble, but targetted on a single player (groupmate). Fast casting.<br />
<br />
Astral Fade:<br />
Self-only Astral Sphere.<br />
<br />
Astral Sphere can be used as a pseudo-coth for pullers, depending on range and how it works with aggro. It can also be used to save someone from death, but that would be much harder.<br />
<br />
Astral Fade will probably prove very popular with wizards. A 2 minute cooldown is much better than a death to a wizard. =) It also makes one think of the low level wizard spell line &quot;fade&quot; or &quot;shadowstep&quot;, but this spell actually works.

because all people ever post about is how <b>they want stuff</b>  or   <b> they need this or that or the other thing to make them balanced</b><br />
<br />
well guess what, begging for things, and and crying 'nerf nerf' with every patch is just about all these boards have come to.  <br />
<br />
giving new things isnt the answer.  remember pok-- it was 'basicly giving all players in everquest the same opertunity to travel as wizards and druids'<br />
<br />
it wasnt nerfing us, it was simply giving things to people.  there are alot of things that have directly effected everquest, and from what i've seen, most of them have been when sony <b>gives</b> people things that arent needed.</div>

LOT more ports for wizards would be great: used to love grouping with wiz pals for that, popping all over to GOOD locations.<br />

Wizards, I think, from my mage perspective, should be the masters of Evocations and Transportation, also Time. Evocations do not summon *matter* even Ice comet when you think about it makes NO sense for a wizard to have...summons a comet of ice...?! <br />
(and I do know wizzies love and view that as their signature spell of old)<br />

-Damage shields have got problems nowadays (go ask mages and ruids and note hwo damage shields were recently tweaked), but short duration high damage ones maybe nice for wizzies?<br />

If not, give us spells that we can cast on a melee character and it will add a significant proc to their weapon (more powerful spells will proc for bigger damage and/or more often).<br />
<br />
Make it where Fire procs for high damage. Ice procs for less damage, but it procs a lot, magic is somewhere in the middle, but adds a stun to the proc. And make it stack with any abilities the weapon may have had before hand.<br />

our one other ability was transportation...not a major ability, was just something to get rid of the pain in the ass of travel..no biggie, not like KEI or something like that.<br />

since that's basically a non issue anymore we need another cool nice time saving ability to replace it, not something game altering...some of these are good ideas the adding a proc onto a weapon, that's a great ideal....<br />

If not, give us spells that we can cast on a melee character and it will add a significant proc to their weapon (more powerful spells will proc for bigger damage and/or more often).<br />

Make it where Fire procs for high damage. Ice procs for less damage, but it procs a lot, magic is somewhere in the middle, but adds a stun to the proc. And make it stack with any abilities the weapon may have had before hand.<br />

Yes, there is such a spell line, For necro's and shadowknights it is called Vampiric embrace, It is a buff on yourself that causes you to proc a Lifetap in melee combat. <br />
<br />
 I already made the suggestion to give Wizards this spell line to target on others and make them proc a DD nuke during the Class Balance discussions during Kunark/Velious. Of course Verant never even considered this, it was To much like a Dmg shield they said, and that was Mages terratory. Then they gave us a new O'kiels.</div>

I don't think that needs to be a matter for exchange for utility.  I think as wizards we are by definition supposed to have the best nukes.  They vary the resist type with expansions to give certain mobs more challenge and give us a spell to look forward to for each new expansion.  I also think we need to keep in mind that there is a limit to the dps upgrades that can be handed out within each level cap without making newer content trivial.<br />

With transportation abilities really being trivial with PoK and new travel abilities being handed out without thought, we should think seriously about what utility would help with group desirability.  A lot of things on the list would seriously infringe on other classes abilities and SoE would be faced with the same situation with another class.  <br />
<br />
You can make the argument that everyone got transportation abilities, but just because we had the utility taken away is not a reason to take away someone else's utility.  The one stipulation given to any utility was that it can not infringe on another class's ability:<br />

DPS upgrades will always be given away, it appears that transportation abilities will be as well.  People have just gotten used to fast travel  instead of braving the elements and taking effort to get to new areas; they are instead going to places that are easy to get to.  A long time ago the argument was that there was too much down time in the game and travel was one of the reasons.  They made changes to the game to compensate but our transportation utility was diminished as a result.<br />
<br />
When getting groups we are one of many dps classes, so what a group is likely to balance filling the spot is utility.  Some wizards do not care about grouping and only care about raiding.  For those that prefer to group, utility is going to help distinguish their dps from other classes' dps.<br />
<br />
It has been suggested before, and shot down but here it goes again:  There is one utility that has yet to be given to a class and that is Endurance Regeneration.  Wizards that have a desire to group should seriously consider lobbying for this ability.  We need interaction between the classes and probably the biggest rift between two class groups is the wizards and the melee.  Many other classes provide added value to the melee groups through haste, health regen and attack.  Wizards are severely lacking in this area.  Please, please please give this some thought.</div>

It doesn't have to be a buff, but that would probably provide the most utility to the wizard class.  They could go any number of routes from a Paladin-like LoH innate ability to an AA for a pulse of replenishment like Paragon of the Spirit.  <br />
<br />
Buffs are not pointless or you wouldn't get any.  It seems, from previous discussions, that buffs are not counted toward the casters ability.  Take wizards for example.  Everyone assumes full mana regeneration buffs when calculating potential dps.  The dps is not attributed to the classes that cast the regen buffs (as it probably should in some cases).  Melee dps is calculated with buff haste but not attributed to the buffer.  These are things that other classes add to a group that a wizard does not have a comparable ability.<br />

You just forgot my disclaimer that comments like that never apply to people who chose to play Gnomes, by definition :)<br />
<br />
&gt;And the one you think would be best that does not infringe on another's class ability is?<br />
<br />
AE DT, works on all Gnomes. Nobody else has this and it is very much needed in game. Zonewide would be a plus.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I don't see Endurance being something that would even be applicable to the Wizard class by any real stretch, so I don't think it makes any real sense to give it to us.<br />
<br />
But buffs are pointless from the perspective you were trying to use them in. Especially since we should remain an overall nonbuffing class in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather see a new kind of self buff that works when people are grouped with you. It wouldn't need to be restricted to the Wizards class only either. Think along the lines of Leadership effects now. I don't think that would be a bad direction to go.</div>
