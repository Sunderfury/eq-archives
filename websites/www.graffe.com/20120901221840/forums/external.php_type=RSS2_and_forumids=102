			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The sheer existence of this product acts in and of itself as a monument to human stupidity.  In brief it is a software tool provided by Repondus for 2 to 5k annually that allows students to take a test at home via the internet in a &quot;secure&quot; environment.  Which here means that the browser will take up the entire screen and not let you do stuff like switch windows or look up the answers in another browser window.  It also is apparently not dumb enough to allow the test to be run in a vm or via wine.<br />
<br />
This is highly effective provided that the student doesn't<br />
<ul><li style="">Look up the answer via a second computer, laptop, or smartphone</li><li style="">Call a friend on the phone</li><li style="">Allow another student to log in to take the test for them</li><li style="">Look up the answer in the book</li></ul><br />
<br />
Basically my tuition is spent on this shit, cheaters can still cheat, and I reboot into windows for the privilege of running the test in their crappy browser.<br />
<br />
How do you actually even sell this product to schools?  Does nobody actually think these things through?<br />
<br />
The only practical way of giving an online test with a reasonable degree of certainty would be to give the students a cheap locked down computer like a chromebook with a webcam and have it record the students screen + environment via webcam while testing.  Bonus points for using facial recognition to identify people taking tests for other people.  Very 1984.<br />
<br />
Alternatively you could avoid giving weight to things that are easily faked and make only tests taken on site or at some testing facility actually count towards your grade.<br />
<br />
Or you could fill your test with things that are time consuming to grade but hard to fake like essay questions that require that you demonstrate in depth knowledge and logical thinking skills!<br />
<br />
Really goddamn hard people.<br />
<br />
While I'm pissed off I'd also like to point out something I've seen recently.   Books with no binding.   Putting aside the issue of writing new editions of books every year for topics like math that haven't changed in a while stupid in itself I have begun to see books that cost as much as $170 which are sold in a plastic bag basically that is meant to be installed in a 3 ring binder that you are required to buy.  Naturally your &quot;book&quot; as its still called despite lacking an essential feature of a book will probably be banged up and have limited resale value next semester when we will probably be using the next edition anyway...<br />
<br />
Textbook publishers you are the weakest link goodbye! You are the reason I downloaded $600 worth of books off the internet this semester.  Die please.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I tried to get Mihoko Ishii looking at this, but he apparently didn't like it, focusing on a more pure vim instance.<br />
<br />
<ol class="decimal"><li style="">Install Sublime Text (Download from <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>).  You can get it for Windows, Linux, and OSX.</li><li style="">Start it up.  If you think Notepad has all of the features you would ever want, enjoy.  If not, move on.</li><li style="">Press <b>ctrl+`</b>  (that's the tick on the key with <b>~</b>).  This will bring up some crazy looking console.  Paste the following into it: <br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Code:</div>
	<hr /><code class="bbcode_code">import urllib2,os; pf='Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path(); os.makedirs(ipp) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None; urllib2.install_opener(urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.ProxyHandler())); open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib2.urlopen('http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read()); print 'Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation'</code><hr />
</div></li><li style=""> It should spit out &quot;Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation&quot;</li><li style=""> Close Sublime Text 2, and reopen it.</li><li style=""> Once the program is open, the command you're going to want to learn is <b>Ctrl+Shift+P</b>.  Hit that, and it should open a mini window with a search bar at the top.</li><li style=""> Search for &quot;Install Package&quot; and click the link.</li><li style=""> Tada! You have all of the available packages</li></ol><br />
<br />
Programmers will probably want to install SublimeREPL.   (REPL=Read&#8211;eval&#8211;print loop; it lets you test code)<br />
<br />
And if they're not using a repository, they might want to install something like Automatic Backups.  Web Programmers might want something such as &quot;View In Browser&quot; to save a bunch of time testing.<br />
<br />
I also like SFTP<br />
<br />
And if you're a fan of VI or VIM, <br />
<br />
<ol class="decimal"><li style="">Click Preferences</li><li style="">Settings Default</li><li style=""> In the file that just opened, scroll down to <b>&quot;ignored_packages&quot;: [&quot;Vintage&quot;]</b> and delete everything inside the brackets so that it looks like <b>&quot;ignored_packages&quot;: []</b></li></ol><br />
This will always default you to Insert mode, you can add <b>&quot;vintage_start_in_command_mode&quot;: true</b> to the settings file if you would rather start in command mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are also a plugin that makes it behave like emacs, but I haven't played with it.<br />
<br />
<br />

			<title>Moving Your Landline to Cell (Google Voice)</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Recently, we cut the cable. It was a big relief, and, with a newborn on the way, we didn't have time to waste on all the frilly channels, anyway. We use an antenna, now, and we get great reception. No problems.<br />
<br />
The next problem was for us to turn off the phone. My wife and I both have cell phones, and a great link here in our home, so there wasn't a compelling reason to keep the landline. However, we do like the phone number. We lucked out and got an easy-to-remember number, and we've listed it on all of our local services. So, if there was a cost-efficient manner in which to transfer it to a &quot;free&quot; service...<br />
<br />
And there is.<br />
<u><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/government/google-voice-a-step-by-step-primer-on-ditching-your-land-line-while-keeping-your-number/10455" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Voice - Step-by-Step Primer on Ditching Your Land Line While Keeping Your Number</a></u><br />
(ZDNet link, scroll down on that website for the &quot;next page&quot;, the links don't seem to work)<br />
<br />
Summary: you cannot transfer a landline to Google Voice, but you can transfer your landline to a mobile phone number, in the US, by use of the Porting laws enforced by the FCC. The trick is to have a *really cheap* mobile option to transfer it to. I used an AT&amp;T GoPhone ($12 purchase, with $10 in credits). Once you have the mobile phone using your landline number, disconnect the landline. Initiate the transfer to Google Voice, making sure to use a New/Custom account for just that purpose. Then, forward the number to your cell or whatever.<br />
<br />
We have the added perk that our phones in our house, Panasonic Cordless <u><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=panasonic+KX-tga410+shopping&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=15&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=panasonic+KX-tga410+shopping&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Et0yUOfeG8HZqgGUiIHYCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q_AUoBQ&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=fc986ff61a8224b1&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KX-TGA410</a></u>, have a &quot;bluetooth&quot; setting where they will connect with up to two cell phones (!) and allow you to use the cordless with your cell service.<br />
<br />
It works really damn well.<br />
<br />
Another $50/month saved!</div>

I want to re-format everything and need to fetch the Outlook profile to preserve all emails. As far as I am aware, all emails are located in a file in the folder &quot;drive:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook  &quot;. <br />

Is it sufficient to just backup the content of these folders and copy&amp;paste them back once I am finished formatting the drive?</div>
