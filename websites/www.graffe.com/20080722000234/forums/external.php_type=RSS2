			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Not my problem, but my brother, to be more exact.<br />
<br />
He had originally been taking classes at UM, but he couldn't quite handle the workload and ended up ditching them in favor of traveling to China to work in a non-profit organization for close to 2 years. He learned Mandarin btw... so I'm set when they become our overlords :p<br />
<br />
So now, he wants to go back to UM, and utilize my parent's tuition remission, (The same one I used). Herein lies the problem.<br />
<br />
The Full Bill went to the house, my mother checked it with UM. According to her, they told her that he needs to be a dependent in order to utilize the tuition reimbursement. She didn't put him as a dependent on the tax return.<br />
<br />
Problem.<br />
<br />
What would be the best way to become a dependent in order to get tuition remission. Anyone knows any loopholes to get around being a dependent?</div>

So, I know the crazy gnome :dmitry: and a few others are actual lawyers, so could you suggest a few books that a 15yr old could read?  I'd love to get him in actual contact with a lawyer that he could talk to and ask questions to, but alas, I don't know any.</div>

Given all the news coverage about the rise of the Chinese economy, you could be forgiven for thinking that the world's most populous country is hogging all the world's resources, while the developed nations are fighting for scraps.<br />
<br />
But, at least with transportation fuel, you'd be wrong. California alone uses more gasoline than any country in the world (except the US as a whole, of course). That means California's 20 billion gallon gasoline and diesel habit is greater than China's! (Or Russia's. Or India's. Or Brazil's. Or Germany's.)<br />
<br />
That's according to the California Energy Commission's State Alternative Fuels Plan, which was posted online last Christmas Eve (pdf). The whole report makes for some fascinating reading because it's a blueprint for a low-carbon and renewable transportation fuel future. The dominant takeaway: it ain't going to be easy.<br />
<br />
One more choice statistic: gasoline usage in California has increased 50 percent, that's 10 6.7 billion gallons, since 1988. Has there been anything close to a commensurate increase in quality of life here to accompany that rise in energy use?<br />
<br />
But China's oil thirst is growing -- to almost 20 billion gallons in 2007 -- and perhaps as early as this year, China's 1.3 billion people will overtake California's 37 million people in total gasoline and diesel usage.

<br />
More th3n China?  I find that pretty amazing.  I understand the dynamics that require us to consume more fuel then Europe as a country, but China compared to one state?  You can do better th3n that.<br />
<br />
Edited:  Fixed the &quot;then&quot;s.</div>

<div style="display: none;">
At first glance, Cesare Bonizzi looks like the archetypal Capuchin monk - round-faced, stout, with twinkling eyes and a long flowing white beard. But beneath his robes beats a heart of metal.<br />
<br />
Brother Cesare is the lead singer in a heavy metal band which has just released its second album.<br />
<br />
A former missionary in the Ivory Coast, he lives in a small friary in the Milan hinterland.<br />
<br />
The 62-year-old monk's love affair with heavy metal began when he attended a Metallica concert some 15 years ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was overwhelmed and amazed by the sheer energy of it&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
Brother Metal<br />
<br />
Hard rock and heavy metal have, over the years, been criticised as the work of the devil.<br />
<br />
It's a claim which Brother Cesare, also known as Brother Metal, says is nonsense.<br />
<br />
He started playing and recording cassettes, firstly with &quot;lighter&quot; metal music, but gradually he realised that what really moved him was the hard core.<br />
	<br />
People think that I am in fancy dress, they can't believe a robed monk is on the stage playing their music<br />
Brother Cesare Bonizzi<br />
<br />
The members of his band were at first sceptical at the idea of teaming up with a Capuchin monk but their doubts soon evaporated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Five minutes after meeting Brother Cesare I decided to go ahead, because he manages to convey so much energy, that other musicians and youngsters often don't manage to express,&quot; lead guitarist, Cesare Zanotti, told Reuters.<br />
<br />
Sex, drugs and alcohol<br />
<br />
Brother Metal recently appeared in the Gods of Metal festival in Italy, along with giants such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Slayer, playing to a crowd of leather-clad hard-core metal fans.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was wonderful being there among all these young people&quot; he told the Rome newspaper La Repubblica.<br />
<br />
&quot;The only problem was that at one stage out slipped a &quot;what the f&quot; because each time some people think that I am in fancy dress, they can't believe a robed monk is on the stage playing their music&quot;.<br />
<br />
With a booming voice, Brother Metal belts out lyrics that are decidedly gritty, talking about real-life issues and not shying away from sex, drugs and alcohol.<br />
<br />
He does touch on faith and religion but is adamant that he is not seeking to draw people to Catholicism through his stage performances.<br />
<br />
Video clips of his performances on YouTube have helped spread his popularity and fan base.<br />
<br />
Devotion to God<br />
<br />
His second heavy metal album, &quot;Misteri&quot; (Mysteries) has just been released.<br />
<br />
In a sign of Brother Metal's eclecticism, it drew inspiration from a group of women in southern Italy who sang about Mary, the mother of Jesus, and a heavy metal version of that song is on the CD.<br />
<br />
Other songs talk about how alcohol warms the heart but excess drinking can damage the liver, and how important sex is to man.<br />
<br />
Brother Cesare says he has never had any trouble with his superiors over his choice of musical career and would like to send his new album to the Pope. &quot;He is a music lover and metal is music!&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
While Brother Cesare always wears his traditional brown robe and sandals as a reminder that he has chosen a life of devotion to God, he is keen to distinguish established religion from faith, and from proselytising.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do it to convert people to life, to understand life, to grab hold of life, to savour it and enjoy it. Full stop&quot; he says.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I went and upgraded my machine recently in order to support HD playback on my Windows Vista Ultimate Edition. For reference, my computer scores a 5.3 out of 5.9 by the Vista Experience Index, due to my processor being a lowly 4.5GHz (WTF?). Other than the processor, the rest of the specs on my system peg to 5.9 cap.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I got a Sony BD player from Best Buy for $150 and installed it on a free SATA channel. Drive came up and was recognized without any trouble, but unfortunately Windows Media Center does not decode BD. Thankfully, the drive comes with a limited version of PowerDVD and from what I've seen, you can also play BD with the latest version of WinDVD. Hopefully, Microsoft will get a BD decoder license for Media Player at some point, I don't like having two movie playing applications.<br />
<br />
I did find a hack of sorts that allows you to configure WMP so that it will launch PowerDVD or WinDVD whenever it finds a Blu-ray disc. That's better than nothing, I suppose. HD on the PC looks great!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>A couple of video's of death knight gameplay.  Having watched them, I can say it is amazing what the current capabilities of the death knight are.  In two of the videos, the only downtime that is taken is the time to find another monster to kill.  It's incredible what the death knight can accomplish.  I definitely see some number adjustment going on to various Death Knight abilities and talents, as I doubt Blizzard wanted them as powerful as they appear in these videos.  If they did, well, I shudder at the thought of facing one in PvP.<br />
<br />
The videos include 2 instances of Blood spec non-stop grinding, one of AoE grinding involving corpse explosion and death and decay (which looks amazing, I might add), and one demonstrating the control and burst capabilities of Frost (the jaw dropping part happening within the first minute).<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/user615417/videos" target="_blank">http://www.vimeo.com/user615417/videos</a><br />
<br />
Some random thoughts:<br />
-Death and Decay looks to complement paladin AE tanking incredibly well.<br />
-Death and Decay will probably get adjusted to be a channeling spell<br />
-The range of on the pull mob-taunt ability will probably be decreased<br />
-Blood Worms will probably either have their chance to spawn reduced or have their health restored reduced<br />
-The ghoul is sweet<br />
-The visual effects of Death Knight spells are incredibly well done.  I hope this mean other classes' spells might get an overhaul in the future.<br />
-Death's Gate looks amazing in particular<br />
-Corpse Explosion grinding, while looking impressive, is probably only feasible when you have a couple of mobs with real low HP (as the little slimes in the video did)<br />
-A skilled player behind a death knight is a force to be reckoned with</div>

I'm a huge fan of the card game of MC, the back story is very interesting esp. if you look at the factions etc. Hence when I heard that a movie was coming out I was dreading the outcome, MC is not exactly a PC world, you got demons, heretics, demonic temples while greed is good and evil walks on earth. How could you ever make a movie out of this?<br />
<br />
Well as it turns out you can't really. The story is focused on earth and you don't get to see a whole lot of the actual five corporations (well considering the time it would actually been four) or how they interact. The start up scene gives an idea at least though. The world it is playing out in is a WW2 with steam tech kind of set up yet they do have modern weapons as well but not modern tanks etc. for the troops (costs to much).<br />
<br />
The story is straight forward enough an ancient enemy is let lose on earth and only our gang of heroes can save us (ever heard that one before?). The story becomes a bit more interesting (though not a whole lot) when the ancient enemy starts to show how it is created etc. but nothing major. One of the things which surprised me though was how bloody it was yet not going over the top. Also it surprised me slightly in how it played out in terms of main character development.<br />
<br />
Still I'd have to say I recommend it, it is a interesting movie but not a masterpiece one. Get good price on the tickets or rent it and watch it in complete darkness,</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>As much as I like a pritine aquarium - super clean, sparkling water - I've decided that algae is a good thing.  After thinking about Koi ponds, and the amount of slime that is allowed to grow - I decided NOT to scrape the algae off the back wall of my aquarium.  It has turned into a brown green mat of something awful, but somehow doesn't look all that bad against a black background.<br />
<br />
But the interesting thing is how much this has improved my water quality.  It used to be that weekly water changes were a must - but now, my tank can go a whole month between water changes.  My fish (one large goldfish in a 30 gallon tank) is much more energetic, and seems to be doing much better health wise.  His fins were rather beat up - but they are improving dramatically, I believe because the of the water quality improvements.<br />
<br />
Lesson learned I guess - sometimes there is such a thing as too clean...<br />
<br />
What do you all do with algae in your tank?  Eliminate or allow?</div>

Long version:<br />
I'm a Starship Trooper fan, I'll admit it straight up. I've read the book and still did not go into a frenzy over how the movie did not follow the book. I saw it for what it was, I laughed and enjoyed it greatly.<br />
<br />
I saw ST2, I flinched at the new computer models, I tried to find some reason not to send a bill to Hollywood for the wasted time. There was one or two moments which was worth watching.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the cartoon version, well done, story was predictable but hey, take it for it was.<br />
<br />
And now I saw ST3 was due to come out and that it was to be &quot;closer to the original&quot; I had some very minor hopes it would not be a Episode 1 - 3 fiasco. Ok, they have remodelled the bugs again fine. They added another three new once for dubious reasons in case of at least one but I'd argue two but ok, I can live with that. They went back to the TV commercial set up and tried to bring it back to ST1, I can dig that. <br />
<br />
But who in the seven hells was paid to write this story because a three year old with a crayon could have done better!!! I was hoping for something more along the lines of Mutant Chronicles (decently done I have to say though the end was, well, stupid) where there was a bit of darkness in the story. I wanted steroid pumped, barb wire chewing, gasoline pissing sergeants with nukes taking on legions; not a bunch of fat guys with tied shoe laces tumbling around trying to figure out which end of the gun to point towards the enemy! I wanted to see new all improved weapons of mass destruction not have the machine guns suddenly downgraded to water guns with out water.<br />
<br />
The only saving grace comes in the name of the movie, the marauders, and only because I'm a desperate fan of what they are (don't want to spoiler that part). Sadly the marauders are in there for a minute or so in total and that is it. The only other saving grace is the song (you'll know which one once you've seen it) I guess but only if you got black humour.</div>
