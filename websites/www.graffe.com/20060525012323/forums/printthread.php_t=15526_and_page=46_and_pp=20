		<div>Had to register here just because of this post and the others in this forum!  Fantastic read and thanks to all the beta testers who have taken the time to answer questions, post pictures and give information.  I am eagerly waiting to play WoW, it looks like a lot of fun!  I played EQ for several years, but I am done playing that now for various reasons and I am really looking forward to WoW more than ever.  Anyway, it was great for me to get a perspective on the game from people who have played EQ.<br />
<br />
I have one question, and I know not everything is done being balanced yet of course, but right now for grouping, do people worry about having X class and pass up people who want to group based on class?  This was a huge problem for me in EQ (my main was a druid, don't hate me :p ) and I am hopeful that it won't be in WoW, whatever class I pick.  All the classes sound so much fun, though I am most interested in shaman and warlock atm.  Thanks again!</div>

Some folks panic if they don't have a priest, Quinalla, but really, healers are pretty much interchangeable, and having anyone who can rez at all is enough a lot of the time. (Healers are only needed for healing mid-fight, since food takes away the downtime issues in EQ.)</div>

		<div>I have another question. I've been reading about WoW in a lot of places now (forums, websites, previews, beta reviews, etc.) and I am certain I read somewhere that when a group was killing monsters for a quest, and a quest item dropped, that *every* member of that group would get their own copy of the item. So indeed, if you killed Big Mr. X, he'd drop up to five heads, one for each of the members in your group (that has the quest active).<br />
<br />
I thought that was a great idea, and takes away the horrible camping areas over and over again for the rest of your group/guild (anyone done the shard camps and emperor key bits for the VT key in EverQuest, to name something? Then you know what I mean).<br />
<br />
However... reading the information topics on the WoW community site, I totally don't get the impression that this is actually how things work in WoW...  :( <br />
<br />
I'll quote one of these parts (taken from <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/partytips.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/...artytips.shtml</a>)<br />
<br />

				Select your quests based on party size. If you can do the quest by yourself, don't waste time doing it in a party. Instead, spend time doing quests that you can't do without a party. You also might want to avoid quests that require each person in the party to collect a lot of parts. For example if the party has 5 members, and you need 20 items for each person, that ends up being 100 items you need to collect! You can complete that much faster by yourself or with a smaller group.

So, perhaps (which I hope) the quoted text is old and they have changed the quest drop system since... or maybe the other way around?<br />
<br />
Could some kind beta tester(s) please tell me/us how these quest drops are currently working in the game as it is today in beta?<br />
<br />
Thankos Muchos! :cool:</div>

		<div>I'm not in the beta (*cries*), but from what I've read I think it works something like this:  <br />
<br />
Some items (like the head of Big Mr. X) are special quest items, and enough of that item will drop for everyone in the group.  Other items (like a fire beetle leg) are just normal drops from creatures that you've been asked to gather for a quest.  These gathering quests do not count the drop as special quest items, so they only drop at whatever frequency is set for the game.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully someone from beta can confirm or set me straight.  :)</div>

I am not in beta either, but that is exactly the impression I get from all that I have read.  Another way to say it is collection quests when you need to get 20 beetle legs are just random drops like any normal drop, so one person loots each time you kill one and that is it.  For quests where you have to kill Mr. BignBad and bring back his head as proof, everyone who has the quest will be able to loot the head.  I am pretty sure that is correct.</div>

		<div>Collection quests are best done solo, since you have to collect like 10 red bandannas or something which drop from normal mobs randomly, and only one red bandanna per mob.  If you are in a group, then it's random drop if you get the quest item.<br />
<br />
Assasination quests are different in that you need to go kill "Mr. X" and bring back proof that you killed him.  In this case, Mr. X will drop however many items of proof are needed for those in the party that have the quest.<br />
<br />
One thing to note about collection quests and the loot rules (usually set to round robin).  If you are in a group of players killing Murloc's for their fins or something, and one person gathers all their items before the rest, that doesn't mean that the mobs he is able to loot won't drop the quest items.  After he is done looting everything he sees on the corpse, those that still require that item will be able to loot it.  Say i'm in a group with two others killing Murlocs.  I need 8 fins to finish, the mage needs 4, and the druid needs 1.  I get to loot every third mob which may or may not have a fin, same with the others in the group.  After the druid loots his last fin, he won't see any more fins drop on mobs, however the mage and myself will be able to loot a fin off the druid's mob if it has one.  It's best to keep an eye on your party-members corpses after they finish looting, their might be a quest item you need on it that they don't and won't see.</div>

I think corpses won't automatically disappear after looting them empty (right?). I also read that the person who can loot the corpse (who's turn it is in round robin I think, to name something) will see the corpse glow.<br />
<br />
If there's a quest item on a corpse (which the original looter couldn't see because he has all the needed items), will it then glow for the rest of the party after initial looting so that they are aware that there's something left on the corpse... or will they just have to try looting the corpses after the (main) looter has looted to check if there's something on it?</div>

Was lookin around for more info on skill points and method to attain them. Someone mentioned they were like AA skills in EQ(altho less overpowering). Also that they are on different bar than normal xp. <br />
<br />
Does that mean you can attain unlimited ammount of them?  :confused: Meaning once you, lets say, hit a level cap you can still kill mobs that give xp and gain skill points from them to be used to raise, lets say, tradeskills? Or did I misunderstand the whole concept behind them?  :rolleyes:  <br />
