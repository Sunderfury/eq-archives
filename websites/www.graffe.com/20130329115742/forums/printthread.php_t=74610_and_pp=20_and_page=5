		<blockquote class="restore">Wilson is very likely to be a perennial contender.  Through the playoffs he played with assurance and confidence, without mistakes.  And yes, in the loss to Atlanta the Seahawks run game was largely shut down-- Wilson had to step up and throw the ball and he came through.  They almost won.  I won't be surprised at all if he is a top QB for years to come.<br />
<br />
I think RG3 might have had a few more rough edges than Wilson but was more athletic.  He's a freak in the sense that no QB with his speed and running ability has ever also been such an exceptional NFL quarterback.  He's one of a kind and no, Wilson wasn't nipping at his heels, ability-wise.  He may very well beat the Redskins in a future NFC championship, but RG3 was faster and accelerated better without losing his ability to throw.  He's also taller and his arm is just as strong if not stronger.<br />
<br />
And it really isn't the &quot;run-first mentality&quot; that got him injured, it was that he wasn't cautious enough and failed to protect himself.  His injury was a blatant personal decision to try and pick up a few extra yards.  He'd just gotten a first down and could have run out of bounds but chose not to.  It was undoubtedly a stupid thing to do but up until that point, RG3 &gt; Russell Wilson.  At least, if you are talking about potential and raw talent, which I am, when I am talking about him being a freak of nature.</blockquote>

Let's just say that I'm not too thrilled to see him in the NFC West. <br />
Wilson - Kapernick are going to give us some interesting duels for years to come :)<br />
<br />
As for his ability, that's to be seen over the course of the years. I will say that he protects himself better than RG3, so that does give him a durability edge. When I'm watching RG3 play, it's a bit like watching downhill skiing: lots of thrills, but you have that nagging feeling in the back of your head that goes &quot;that guy could be a crumpled pile of hurt, any second now&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'd hate for RG3 to be the Bob Sanders or Troy Polamalu of QB's.</blockquote>

Brady beat St. Louis &amp; Kurt Warner, Carolina Panthers &amp; Jake Delhomme, &amp; Philadelphia &amp; Donovan McNabb. No victory was more than 3 points. When Brady has won a Superbowl, both times he got the team into field-goal range and it was left to Adam Vinatieri to kick the team to victory. Brady has two loses both against New York Giants &amp; Eli Manning, his first loss he threw one touchdown and lost 14 to 17, in his second loss he threw 2-1 TD/INT and lost 17 to 21.<br />
<br />
Montana has four wins &#8212; three blowouts and one unforgettable last-minute victory. Montana beat Cincinnati &amp; Ken Anderson, Miami &amp; Dan Marino (38 to 16 victory), Cincinnati &amp; Boomer Esiason, and Denver &amp; John Elway (55 to 10 victory).<br />
<br />
Joe Montana is clearly the better playoff and Super Bowl QB.</blockquote>

Joe Gibbs won three Super Bowls with three different QB's. In Montana's wins, look at who they were playing and what kind of supporting cast those QB's had.

While I'm sure Manning has made plenty of playoff mistakes (this past weekend no exception), the Broncos also gave up 38 points.  Yeah, Manning threw 2 huge interceptions, but the Broncos defense looked pretty average while the Ravens offense played really well.  Did anyone predict Torrey Smith would run circles around Champ Bailey?  Obviously there's the Rahim Moore mistake.  Broncos also made some bad coaching calls, the most obvious WTF decision being to not even give Peyton frigging Manning a chance to get within field goal range with 31 seconds and 2 timeouts left in regulation.  There's conservative and then there's just stupid.<br />
<br />
On balance I wouldn't say that Manning had an unlucky game and I would say that Flacco outplayed Manning.  But if the Broncos had taken 3 more plays, kicked a field goal and won it in regulation, no one would care about the INT or that he didn't throw many deep passes.</blockquote>
