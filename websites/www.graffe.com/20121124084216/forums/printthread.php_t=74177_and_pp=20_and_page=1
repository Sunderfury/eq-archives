	<div class="content">
		<blockquote class="restore">As I predicted, the endgame of GW2 is incomplete.  All of the dungeons are still very rough in terms of testing and balancing.  The encounters can be broken, unfair of sometimes way too easy with no boss mechanics to speak of.  The rewards are lackluster, irrelevant and frankly still broken (a lot of reports that the token numbers are not the same from person to person).  Orr, the one level 80 zone, is packed full of fast respawning mobs.  It can be a nice challenge to move about but there is not a real incentive to do so.  The final dungeon, Arah, suffers from many of the design issues above and indeed in story mode is almost silly.  <br />
<br />
The &quot;big Baddie&quot; encounters that are on a timer in many of the zones are fun the first few times you do them but after that really are loot pinata races whose only challenge is figuring out the best way to do the most damage to get the gold rewards.  <br />
<br />
So what do you do at 80?  <br />
<br />
First, give up the idea of &quot;80&quot; in PvE.  You are really just a top tiered character for your zone.  Your &quot;80-ness&quot; is just an indication that you will be nice an powerful relative to where you are.  What I love to do, what makes the game great for me, is going to a new zone and exploring.  I don't mean running from point to point and opening the zone and getting the completion reward.  I mean doing the events, talking to the NPCs reading the text for anyone that has it.  I mean climbing the mountains, poking my nose in the caves and watching the NPC behaviors.  There has never been a more beautiful in depth world as this.  Don't skim the surface and think you have played the game.  Up until the last 2-3 zones these babies are handcrafted and complete worlds unto themselves.  They have meta stories, and like ten mini stories.  Events fit into the patterns of those stories and every zone has weird memorable NPCs with tons of dialogue.  You are definitely rewarded for finding new places.  There are cool events hidden, there are mini boss mob encounters that are challenging.  There are rich nodes and chests in the out of the way places.  This what the game really is... just exploration and encounter.  It's the most immersive game ever made.  <br />
<br />
The second really GOOD thing i have found at 80 is WvW.  Being 80 makes you significantly but not substantially more powerful in WvW.  Being able to trick out your build and gear, afford repair costs and blue prints for siege weapons is a good thing.  It's an advantage but not a huge one. <br />
<br />
WvW is clearly based on the old DAoC style of conquest and keeps.  However, it is much more complex and shifting.  The goals stretch from what a solo player can do with smart guerilla style tactics to hour long keep sieges with hundreds of players.  There are some technical problems right now with the scoring, the graphics and some serious cheating, but overall this is a super fun part of the game.  It also has a nifty cool hat I want so Ima gonna do this for a while.  <br />
<br />
SO that is what I do now... explore places closely and do WvW.  I may start some twinks once I get my money up some.  I still need to do lots of the explorable mode dungeons and I have only scratched the surface of the game based PvP.  <br />
<br />
Given that all of this is for the 65 bucks I orginally paid, I would rate GW2 as the best game out there and certainly the best buy for the bucks.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Hard to argue with that.  It's a great game.<br />
<br />
After a month in-game, I only have two complaints:<br />
<br />
1 - All champion mobs need to drop some kind of loot.  Nothing more frustrating than 8-10 people working together to wail on a 5,000,000 hp Giant for 15 minutes and come up with absolutely nada for loot.  At least throw a few silver on it or something to cover repairs.<br />
<br />
2 - Too many broken events.  After yesterday's patch, I ran through 3 zones that I needed just one thing to finish and got them all caught up. By last night, there are 2 other zones that I can't complete because a skill point or an event is broken.  They really need to spend some time and fix these.<br />
<br />
Other than those two things, I'm having a blast in this game.  The world is gorgeous, the stories are decent.  I love the fact that I can't outlevel an area (like you could in SWTOR and other games).  It's really a fun game.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Sehra, hit up Frostgorge Sound.  I think you'll like it a lot better than Orr.  It's a level 70 to 80 zone just north of the Norn newbie area (always fun to zone in and see a level 12 dead after meeting a level 72 Grawl).  It has Hearts, skills, vistas and all of that.  The story is a lot tighter with several focuses and it's not the death trap that Orr is.  In my opinion, Frostgorge Sound is a much more satisfying level 80 area than Orr.<br />
<br />
The thing Orr has going for it is non-stop events. You can farm a lot of Karma (and some silver) on them but you have to deal with all the crap you mentioned.</blockquote>

I enjoyed both sPVP and WvW, but I simply don't have time to do everything, and haven't sPVPed since the betas as a result. I hear it's current state is a bit sad though, with people apparently abusing certain classes. Of course, you should always take crying on game forums with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
The small changes are what makes the game for me. It's going to be hard going back to a game where zones are greyed out because you are too high level, or having fights over resources, etc etc.<br />

</div>This is why I'm not 80 yet. Completing a zone for me isn't just about what the game tracks (although I really like that part too), but seeing and doing as much as possible. I spend so much time just talking to npcs like a dork, or chasing down events I have not seen yet. The zones are so big though, and some of the timers so unpredictable, that I have to make myself accept the fact that I'm not going to see everything, and hope I see stuff I missed the first time when playing an alt.<br />
<br />
So for example, I saw a forum post about an endearing npc character arc in Gendarren Fields. A brusque soldier is hired as a bodyguard for an asuran child. I saw screenshots of the dialogue they share. Through my own exploring I found pirates up north talking about possible targets, combined with some of the npc dialogue at the mansion makes me believe there is an event or series of events here. But I could sit around for an hour and never see it. Meanwhile if I play normally, I will likely only happen upon an event after it has already started.<br />
<br />
It's kind of interesting. Many of the events seem to be player triggered, although the player never knows it, and isn't always near the event they spawned in the first place. This is why the more people that are in a zone, the more events end up getting started. Sometimes the npcs give you hints, but I've only seen one that was really blatant. In the blood coast area, a champion shark event can spawn. If you talk to the quaggans when it isn't up, they will tell you that they are looking out for the shark, and to please not kill the small fish as the blood will attract sharks.<br />
<br />
Other events begin by talking to an npc, but the vast majority of them have a large indicator over their head letting you know it starts an event. Much to my confusion, most players I see don't realize this. They run straight past the npc, but then when I trigger the event myself, they make a beeline straight back.<br />
<br />
P.S. The taste of Orr you get from one of the storyline missions is enough for me to dread finally going there myself. Although fighting undead chickens is pretty funny. The first time. I can only imagine you are supposed to do it in groups.</blockquote>

As for GW2, I have yet to give in and play it, I'm going to wait until the weather starts to get bad and I spend more time at my computer instead of in the pool/playing golf/etc.  I will admit, though, the more I read the threads here the more I feel like I do need to give it more of a go than I was able to during beta.</blockquote>

Starting to see a lot more skill challenges that require killing veteran type mobs which can be rather difficult solo. It's usually the adds that make it hard because you have to aoe while running or be able to heal through the damage.</blockquote>

			<div class="message">It's ok, I have a feeling there are a lot of people with a low opinion towards you as well, and you can count me as one of them.  Just because a pompous, overblown twit like you feels WoW is no longer fun really means nothing to anyone except you.<br />
<br />
As for GW2, I have yet to give in and play it, I'm going to wait until the weather starts to get bad and I spend more time at my computer instead of in the pool/playing golf/etc.  I will admit, though, the more I read the threads here the more I feel like I do need to give it more of a go than I was able to during beta.</div>

</div>I'll be honest. You are probably missing something, even if I am not seeing it at the moment. There are two whole games on my hard drive right now, and mymathlab keeps me playing a whole different kind of game anyway. GW2 is cool, for all the reasons stated here, but it also doesn't call to me the way other games sometimes do. I'm not sure why, but it's just the way I feel. Once the weather turns, and you have some time to burn, drop the 60 and party on. You will probably feel a lot better about it than I do.<br />
<br />
Kudos for not letting a loudmouth on the Internet dictate any of this to you. And yes -- I've been guilty of being that guy plenty of times, so -- MI -- not judging. Just saying.</blockquote>

</div>I'm at the other end.  GW2 has caught my interest more than any game since WoW.  Granted I just don't have the time to put into it the way I've had for others when I was single and not a dad, but it has hooked my interest where plenty of others didn't.</blockquote>

</div>Nothing wrong with that. The game has tons to speak for it. I just find it interesting that when I had 2 hours last week to play a game, I chose the other one. I don't feel the slightest bit guilty about it either. After all -- GW2 isn't costing me anything extra per month, which is a huge innovation (and relief,) to be honest.</blockquote>
