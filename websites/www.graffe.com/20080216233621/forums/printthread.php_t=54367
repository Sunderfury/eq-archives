			<div><strong>The spell revamp</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>As you can see, the casting time changes that were on Lucy made it in. They were also retroactively applied to the TSS/TBS spells as well. The change is pretty controversial to say the least. They aren't as extreme as the first version was (with 12 second recast on the instants), but they are still quite different from before.<br />
<br />
Some of the major differences between what you will see in SoF and now:<br />
<ul><li>Instants are now all linked on the same timer so you won't be able to chain 2 of them for burst DPS.</li><li>The magic instant has had its effciency lowered and it damage increased. It has a 3 second recast and 2.25 refresh.</li><li>The fire/cold instants have had their recast increased to a 8 seconds at rank 3. The recourse on both has been changed and the cold one no longer is spell slow. Instead, they do damage to you and give you a 1 tick buff (6-12 secs) that will increase the base damage of your next nuke with a base cast time of 3 seconds or more by the same amount. The damage is able to be focussed and critted as normal.</li><li>All the other direct damage spells have had their cast times basically reduced by half or more. The ones that wouldn't be affected by spell haste after the revision got lowered more to account for that. To account for the cast time reduction, the recast on the spells was raised. It goes down by 0.25 seconds as you go up a rank of spells.</li></ul><br />
Basically works out like this:<br />
<br />
4 second cast, Recast: Rk1 = 5.75 Rk2 = 5.5 Rk3 = 5.25<br />
3.75 second cast, Recast: Rk1 = 5.5 Rk2 = 5.25 Rk3 = 5<br />
3.5 second cast, Recast: Rk1 = 5.25 Rk2 = 5 Rk3 = 4.75<br />
1.5 second cast, Recast: Rk1 = 5.25 Rk2 = 5 Rk3 = 4.75<br />
1.25 second cast, Recast: Rk1 = 5 Rk2 = 4.75 Rk3 = 4.5<br />
0.75 second cast, Recast: Rk1 = 4.25 Rk2 = 4 Rk3 = 3.75<br />
Fire/Cold instants, Recast: Rk1 = 8.50 Rk2 = 8.25 Rk3 = 8.00<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind the numbers on the final spells may change as spell tuning was delayed until after release.<br />
<br />
I'm not totally happy with all the numbers myself, especially the efficiency on the magic instants, but there is a still a good chance that some of these may get better since they tend to set things conservatively to begin with.</div>

		<div>Rime Snap, Rk II<br />
<br />
1183 mana<br />
0 cast 8.25 recast -50 CR<br />
5186 damage<br />
Chill: 25% chance at +1121 damage on next nuke<br />
<br />
So, pure-cold instants while kiting, assuming average +60% damage from crits/foci:<br />
<br />
(5186 + .25*1121) * 1.6 / 8.25 = 1060 DPS<br />
Assuming 30% mana savings:<br />
(5186 + .25*1121) * 1.6 / (1183*.7) = 10.6 damage per mana<br />
<br />
Cold Snap, Rk II (current)<br />
1048 mana<br />
4399 damage<br />
0 cast, 6 recast, -50 CR<br />
Ignore chill effect.<br />
<br />
1106.4 DPS<br />
9.6 damage per mana<br />
<br />
Cold Snap, Rk II (pre-nerf)<br />
4399 damage<br />
978 mana<br />
1173.1 DPS<br />
10.3 damage per mana<br />
<br />
So the result: the new instants are <b>more efficient</b> than the pre-nerf instants.  They do slightly less DPS if all you do is chain-cast the instant.<br />
<br />
However, if you cast an instant, then pause 3/4 of a second to cast a non-instant...<br />
<br />
You can easily fit a Chaos Conflagaration (for example) during the recast.<br />
<br />
That boosts your damage per 8.25 second cycle up by another +3613.6<br />
<br />
So, instant + fast cast nuke:<br />
(5186 + .25*1121 + 2258.5) * 1.6 / 8.25 = 1498.1 DPS<br />
Assuming 30% mana savings:<br />
(5186 + .25*1121 + 2258.5) * 1.6 / ((1183+382)*.7) = 11.3 damage per mana<br />
<br />
And voila -- 30% upgrade in kiting DPS and a boost in efficiency from simply swapping in a fast-cast efficient nuke during the downtime.  It does mean you have to pause every 8 seconds for less than a second.<br />
<br />
I'm betting with the new Ethereals (doing 9500 damage) an instant/big nuke pattern will produce more DPS than old instant-chaining at a better efficiency.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
This needs more work, and problems will probably boil out post-live.<br />
<br />
But this actually makes a wizard <b>better</b> at kiting than they where before the first instant nerf.  A good 25% boost in DPS and a smaller boost in efficiency.<br />
<br />
One can't use a horse to kite this way, however.</div>

		<div>Yakk, the insta-recourse doesnt work on spells with cast time less than 3secs. So it wouldnt work on the alternating pattern you describe if i understand correctly.<br />

Forcing us to cast long 3+ second spells absolutely does nothing to make wizards better kiters. <br />
<br />
It makes us better at being stationary. Which sucks.</div>

		<div>I like the changes and the possible versatility.  It feels like if I much rather cast fast nukes, I can forgo the positive recourse and cast fast nukes.  Whereas in a raid if I'm in a situation where all I'm concerned with is maxing DPS, I have these other options.<br />
<br />
It'll be interesting to see it in action.  Seems promising, though!<br />

		<div>Ah, missed that!<br />
<br />
With a 3 second casting spell (hasted down to 2 seconds), you can still fit the entire nuke cycle inside the recast of the instant nuke.<br />
<br />
It does mean that it would be wise to snare the mob, and you have to spend some time standing still for 2 to 3 seconds every 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Stopping the use of the recourse means that your efficiency is about the same as the Rk II TSS spells where pre-nerf, and higher than the current instants.<br />
<br />
Your DPS will be lower than the current or pre-nerf:<br />
1006 SoF (+60% damage from AA/Crit -- you can do better)<br />
1106 now<br />
1173 pre-nerf<br />
<br />
that is in a 'riding a horse, kiting a non-summoner that can't be snared' mode.<br />
<br />
Note that, in terms of XP/hour, your efficiency has as large an impact as burn speed (roughly).<br />
<br />
It takes about 3.5 minutes to empty a <b>20,000 point</b>, then 3.5 minutes to recover your mana.  More efficiency lets you do more damage over those 7 minutes.  More &quot;burn speed&quot; lets you reduce the 3.5 drain time, but doesn't touch your 3.5 recovery time.<br />
<br />
So a 10% boost in burn speed (with the same efficiency) would only boost your XP/hour by 5%.  A 10% boost in efficiency (with no change in burn speed) would boost your XP/hour by 5%.<br />
<br />
And the smaller your pool, the more important efficiency is relative to burn speed (as more time is spent medding and less is spent nuking).<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The fast 0.75 casting time nukes can be used even if they don't trigger the recourse extra damage, assuming you aren't horse-kiting.  They would still boost your efficiency and DPS over the pre-nerf instants.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The reduction in recast with higher ranks is interesting.<br />
<br />
I don't think it goes far enough to make sure that top-end wizards can keep up with top-end melee DPS, while bazaar-wizards don't completely overshadow bazaar-melee DPS.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Anyone want to revamp the nuke pattern spreadsheet I wrote up?  Heh.  Lots of work.</div>

		<div>If the instants had got the normal revamp (they got slightly better efficiency upgrades), they would look like this chaining rank 3s with end game gear. <br />
<br />
1368 Mana, 5603 Damage<br />
<br />
So assuming you have a bard so both instants would be focused, the average damage is basically:<br />
<br />
2 * (5603 + 5603 * 180% * 28% + 5603 * 35% / 2 + 5603 * 70% / 2) = ~22737 damage<br />
<br />
22737 / 6 = 3789.5 DPS<br />
<br />
22737/ (1368 * 2) = 8.31 DPM ignoring mana preservation effects<br />
<br />
<br />
Casting FF/EI in combination yields:<br />
<br />
FF  = (5603 + 5603 * 180% * 28% + 5603 * 35% / 2 + 5603 * 70% / 2)  = ~11368<br />
Since FF has a recourse that affects the base damage of the next nuke, we use 10264 + 1121 * 25% for the base damage of EI.<br />
<br />
 (10544.25 + 10544.25 * 180% * 28% + 10544.25 * 35% / 2 + 10544.25 * 70% / 2) = ~21394<br />
<br />
= 11368 + 21394 = ~32762<br />
<br />
32762 / 8 = 4095.25 DPS<br />
<br />
32762 / ( 1278 + 2496) = 8.68 DPM ignoring mana preservation effects<br />
<br />
If you want to factor in mana resurgence, thats about 1973 damage per nuke on average, so:<br />
<br />
22737 + 1973 + 1973 = 26683 / 6 = 4447.17 DPS<br />
<br />
32762 + 1973 + 1973 = 36708 / 8 = 4588.5 DPS<br />
<br />
If you don't have a bard, the difference is even bigger of course since the second case is all the same resist instead of 2. I'm not totally happy with all the numbers on the spells at the moment, but this is where they are right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
There have been other numbers posted by people, I'm sure they will show up here as the day goes on as well.</div>

Am i reading this wrong?<br />
You'll have to use cbs then FF then something else till 8 seconds after you cast FF or else use cbs exclusively every 3 seconds which yeilds an unfocused dps of ~ 1850 for rk 2 with a damage per mana ratio akin of casting lures.</div>

		<div>So I'm just making sure I'm understanding the system right.  I'm going to use TSS/TBS names since I'm not quite familiar with the SoF stuff yet.<br />
<br />
1) CBS still has the negative root recourse - with no positive recourse.<br />
<br />
2) Can I cast CBS and right after I cast FF?  I can do that, but then there would be a 8 second time period before I can cast *any* instant again, right?  Or is it that I can't do *that* and after I cast CBS I can't cast any instant until the 3 second refresh is up.  Which means after I cast CBS and wait for the 2.25 gem refresh, I can either<br />
<br />
a) Wait .75 seconds and cast CBS again, and rinse and repeat A.<br />
b) Wait .75 seconds and cast FF or CS, and then cast other stuff for 8 seconds.  Then start back up with CBS and pick a, b, or c.<br />
c) Cast any other nuke and by the time it's all said and done I can cast CBS again.<br />
<br />
3) Without actually doing the numbers, what's considered a good casting cycle to start experimenting with in groups or on raids?<br />
<br />
a) Open with FF.  No recourse = baby nuke 1 baby nuke 2.  Recourse = big fire nuke (Sothgar's Flame)?  GoRM = biggest fire nuke (Ethereal Conflagaration)<br />
b) Open with FF.  No recourse = big fire nuke.  Recourse = biggest fire nuke.  GoRM = biggest fire nuke.<br />
c) baby nuke baby nuke baby nuke baby nuke (chain CI and WMS)<br />
d) Open with FF.  No recourse = baby nuke 1 baby nuke 2.  Recourse = biggest fire nuke.  GoRM = biggest fire nuke.<br />
<br />
Do any of these sound like a reasonable to start?  Or another option?<br />

That is a million dollar question!!!<br />
<br />
All DPS has gotten substantial boosts.<br />
<br />
We have a very strong headline number, chaining SoF FF and SoF EC will give you a high DPS figure. This is an expensive propositon and I really want to know how often we can actualy use it.<br />
<br />
Once you step down to say SoF FF and SoF Soth, you are falling off the cliff.<br />
SoF Soth is lower DPS than TSS Instants. This is however going to be strat you use most. This is the strat that you would use on those 3-6 min fights. It is early to say but you will be compeating with rangers and beasts in DPS.<br />
<br />
Sustainable part is really not bad if you talk about chaining stuff like SoF WMS and SoF CI. With new Mana Recursion it looks like a 2500 DPS. Don't hold me to these numbers I have done them so long ago and stuff has been changeing all the time. Again this seems great in vacum. Let me say this, rogs are parsing 2500 DpS on test dummy for 6 hrs. Necros will be able to sustain some very large numbers too.<br />
<br />
Numbers will be out soon enough, we will see what we got for losing instants.<br />
<br />
My view is that this is a bad trade and that our numbers are hollow and will set us back. I hope I am proven wrong</div>

In addition to what Gavrilo mentioned..<br />
<br />
It's hard to balance us overall since we have access to the best &quot;weapons&quot; (i.e. spells) from the start with the only limiting factor being the amount of mana each individual has.  When TSS hit, wizards were able to push out insane amounts of dps in group settings.  This produced a collective moan from the community that brought us into the limelight for the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
Tangent aside, we have the best weapons available from the get-go, melee will need to wait to receive them.  If they out-parse us from the start, there is nowhere for them to go but up while we stay the same.  As it stands, I hope that another look is taken at the current set-up though I'd like to see some numbers first-hand before making a final decision.<br />
<br />
Also, when was the last time spells from a previous expansion were changed to reflect an upcoming one?  Why were those changes warranted in this case?</div>

		<div>the changes to TSS/TBS spells have been in the works for months.  They were going to be changed &quot;by the end of august&quot; and kept getting pushed.  this revamp in our nuking style has been planned for some time they just did not get it implemented so decided to change all of them with the new expansion vice changing it then a couple weeks later putting out the new expansion.</div>

If Prathun made this change in August, you'd be screaming bloody murder.<br />
<br />
Most of the nerf is masked by SoF upgrades. You will also get 13% DPS boost just from AAs, uou get 2.5% from familiar, 5% from gear (SoF foci go up to 75%).</div>

So soth+FF is about the same dps as tss instants except it's 25% more efficient.  If you need more dps then switch out some soths for ec's.  I am not seeing the cliff you mention.  Nobody is forcing you to use either all Soth or all EC to mix with FF.</div>

		<div>I just don't see that big of a nerf.  I'm worried that it wont be enough of an increase going forward to compete with melee, but I just don't see how the nerf is going to serious effect me.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you're seriously going to tell me you kite snareless and chain cloudburst and another instant, it doesn't effect kiting -- and if you do your death count must be outrageous.<br />
<br />
On raids, if you're chaining instants, then you'll probably be fine to chain the new magic instant and gain more dps on fights of that length, or twist one ice/fire instant and wms, base fire or base cold for recourse; that should net you more dps on any fight that isn't keyed explicitly to max chain instant combat.<br />
<br />
In groups, the cast reduction will rule all, instants were never the best way to parse high over 2 or 3 hours of grind anyway, and the new cloudburst will net you more pure dps for group named in almost any situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just really don't see it.<br />
<br />
<br />
One thing I am kind of worried about, is the -10 resist on the base cold fire magic spells.  We should really be looking at -50 minimum resist on our nukes at this point.</div>
