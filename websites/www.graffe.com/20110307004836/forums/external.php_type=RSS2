			Aliens exist, and we have proof.<br />
<br />
That astonishingly awesome claim comes from Dr. Richard B. Hoover, an astrobiologist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, who says he has found conclusive evidence of alien life — fossils of bacteria found in an extremely rare class of meteorite called CI1 carbonaceous chondrites. (There are only nine such meteorites on planet Earth.) Hoover’s findings were published late Friday night in the Journal of Cosmology, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.<br />
<br />
“I interpret it as indicating that life is more broadly distributed than restricted strictly to the planet earth,” Hoover, who has spent more than 10 years studying meteorites around the world, told FoxNews.com in an interview. “This field of study has just barely been touched — because quite frankly, a great many scientist would say that this is impossible.”<br />
<br />
Hoover discovered the fossils by breaking apart the CI1 meteorite, and analyzing the exposed rock with a scanning-electron microscope and a field emission electron-scanning microscope, which allowed him to detect any fossil remains. What he found were fossils of micro-organisms, many of which he says are strikingly similar to those found on our own planet.<br />
<br />
“The exciting thing is that they are in many cases recognizable and can be associated very closely with the generic species here on earth,” said Hoover. Some of the fossils, however, are quite odd. “There are some that are just very strange and don’t look like anything that I’ve been able to identify, and I’ve shown them to many other experts that have also come up stump.”<br />
<br />
In order to satisfy the inevitable hoard of buzz-killing skeptics, Hoover’s study and evidence were made available to his peers in the scientific community in advance of the study’s publications, giving them a chance to thoroughly dissect his findings. Comments from those who decided to sift through the evidence will be published online, alongside the study.<br />
<br />
“Given the controversial nature of his discovery, we have invited 100 experts and have issued a general invitation to over 5,000 scientists from the scientific community to review the paper and to offer their critical analysis,” writes Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics scientist Dr. Rudy Schild, who serves as the Journal of Cosmology’s editor-in-chief. “No other paper in the history of science has undergone such a thorough vetting, and never before in the history of science has the scientific community been given the opportunity to critically analyze an important research paper before it is published.”<br />
<br />
Needless to say, if Hooverâ€™s conclusions are found to be accurate, the implications for human life will be staggering. Hereâ€™s to hoping that heâ€™s right.

			LiveScience.com – Fri Mar 4, 6:45 pm ET<br />
The world just got a little weirder: Scientists have identified four new species of brain-controlling fungi that turn ants into zombies that do the parasite's bidding before it kills them.<br />
Identified from samples collected at two sites in Brazil's tropical rain forest, each of the four species specializes in controlling a different species of carpenter ant.<br />
The original zombie-ant fungus, Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, was first identified in 1865, and it seems to exist around the world. [Mind-Controlling Parasites Date Back Millions of Years]<br />
&quot;So we knew, right off the bat, there was a range of other species within that,&quot; said study researcher David Hughes, an entomologist at Pennsylvania State University. &quot;I think it will turn out to be in the hundreds.&quot;<br />
Once it infects an ant, the fungus uses as-yet-unidentified chemicals to control the ant's behavior, Hughes told LiveScience. It directs the ant to leave its colony (a very un-ant-like thing to do) and bite down on the underside of a leaf — the ant's soon-to-be resting place. Once it is killed by the fungus, the ant remains anchored in place, thanks to its death grip on the leaf.<br />
Ultimately, the fungus produces a long stalk that protrudes from the ant's head, shooting spores out in the hopes of infecting other ants. Two of the four newly discovered species also sprouted smaller stalks elsewhere, including from the victim's feet and lower leg joints – the equivalent of knees.<br />
The spores of the four species also had distinct features and germination processes.<br />
Hughes is concerned that one of the four fungus species, O. camponoti-novogranadensis, may not be around for much longer. During their visits to Brazil, Hughes and his colleagues saw that the high-elevation site where the species was found had become markedly drier and hotter. Hughes attributed the change in conditions at the Parque Estadual de Itacolomi, which is near the World Heritage Site Ouro Preto, to global warming.<br />
The ants can survive this shift in the local climate, but &quot;the fungus can't,&quot; he said. &quot;What we think we will see is the extinction event of the fungus we just managed to describe.&quot; (Hughes said fungi are essential aquatic organisms living in terrestrial environments, making them extra-sensitive to a drying climate.)<br />
The research by Hughes and colleagues Simon Elliot and Harry Evans appears online today (March 2) in the journal PLoS ONE.

			<center><blockquote><blockquote><u>Editor's Note: CNN’s Soledad O’Brien chronicles the dramatic fight over the construction of a mosque in the heart of the Bible belt. “Unwelcome: The Muslims Next Door”, airs Sunday, March 27 at 8 p.m. E.T.<br />
</u></blockquote></blockquote>---</center><br />
<br />
When Akbar Ahmed, an Islamic studies professor at American University, learned that Congress would be holding hearings on &quot;the radicalization of American Muslims,&quot; he vowed to help influence their direction.<br />
<br />
“The community is anxious, uncertain and even fearful in terms of what this could become in this environment,” says Ahmed, who is Muslim. “There is a generalized sense of Islamophobia floating around, and the hearings are not doing anything to assuage Muslim fears.”<br />
<br />
So the professor scheduled an appointment with the staff of House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King, who convened the hearings - the first of which is Thursday - and presented his detailed research on the views and experiences of American Muslims.<br />
<br />
“At first they seemed defensive and cautious,” Ahmed said of King’s staffers. “But over the course of an hour, they became very receptive.”<br />
<br />
A week before the first in what King says will be a series of hearings on American Muslim radicalization that may stretch out for more than a year, Muslims in America are deeply nervous at the specter of being demonized from such a high-visibility platform as Capitol Hill.<br />
<br />
But King’s hearings have also galvanized American Muslims, perhaps as never before, in an attempt to counter what they call a rising tide of Islamophobia, to lobby Washington about their concerns and to help shape the national narrative about their community.<br />
<br />
The efforts come a little more than six months after many Muslims were blindsided by a wave of national opposition to a proposed Islamic cultural center near New York’s ground zero last summer.<br />
<br />
“There was this sense that after last summer’s events of needing to be more proactive in stemming this activity that stokes anti-Muslim hate,” says Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, a national legal advocacy group.<br />
<br />
“That’s why, as soon as we heard Rep. King say he planned to hold these hearings, we started coming forward to express our concerns,” Khera says.<br />
<br />
In February, Muslim advocates spearheaded a letter to congressional leaders objecting to the hearings. It was signed by more than 50 organizations, including civil rights groups that had not previously been involved with the American Muslim community.<br />
<br />
The Council on American-Islamic Relations,  a leading Muslim advocacy group, used its annual lobbying day last month to visit 90 congressional offices to “start offering facts about American Muslims and their role in helping prevent attacks on our nation,” ahead of King’s hearings, says Corey Saylor, the group’s national legislative director.<br />
<br />
Two other groups - the Muslim Public Affairs Council and the Arab American Institute - held a briefing, “Islamophobia: A Challenge to American Pluralism,” for Capitol Hill staffers on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
Dozens of religious groups and a handful of celebrities, including music mogul Russell Simmons, are promoting an &quot;I am Muslim, too&quot; rally in New York's Times Square on Sunday aimed at countering the hearings.<br />
<br />
The hearings are also spurring mosques around the country to get more political.<br />
<br />
“Muslim-Americans make vital contributions every day,” said Hadi Nael, the director of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley in California, whose congregation is calling and writing Congress to voice opposition to the King hearings.<br />
<br />
“They love this country just as every American does and should not be placed under suspicion of terrorism because of their religious beliefs or ethnic background,” he said. “King’s hearings would do just that.”<br />
<br />
Many Muslim activists say that recent remarks from King, including his support for a theory that 80% of American mosques are controlled by radical imams, are evidence that he intends to broadly target the American Muslim community with his hearings, rather than focus on Islamic radicals.<br />
<br />
“Let’s not fall into the same ugly patterns that were prevalent in earlier years in America, when Jews were suspected of aiding communism and Catholics were suspected of supporting fascism,” says Eboo Patel, a leading Muslim activist, summing up his opposition to the hearings. “Let’s not repeat that history by blaming all Muslims for the extremist actions of a range of people in this country.”<br />
<br />
King called for the hearings after Republicans took control of the House of Representatives last year, declining calls from some Democrats to broaden the sessions to focus on extremists of all types, including neo-Nazis, radical environmentalists and anti-tax groups.<br />
<br />
“Al Qaeda is actively attempting to recruit individuals living within the Muslim American community to commit acts of terror,” King wrote in a letter last month to Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, the ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee, who’d suggested that King broaden the hearings’ scope.<br />
<br />
“Pursuant to our mandate, the Committee will continue to examine the threat of Islamic radicalization, and I will not allow political correctness to obscure a real and dangerous threat to the safety and security of the citizens of the United States,” King’s letter continued.<br />
<br />
King has declined recent interview requests to discuss the hearings, including those from CNN, and has yet to release a full witness list for next week’s hearing, exacerbating Muslim anxiety.<br />
<br />
The sole witness whose name King has released is Zuhdi Jasser, an Arizona doctor who is Muslim but who has criticized his religion.<br />
<br />
King has also invited U.S. Rep Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota - the first Muslim elected to Congress - to testify. “We have interviewed dozens of prospective witnesses,” King said in a statement to CNN.<br />
<br />
Democrats, meanwhile, have invited Los Angeles County Sheriff Leroy Baca, who has praised Muslim leaders for building relationships with law enforcement authorities, to testify.<br />
<br />
A recent survey showed that 56% of Americans support the upcoming hearings, compared with 29% who think they’re a bad idea.<br />
<br />
The February survey, conducted by Public Opinion Research and the Religion News Service, found that seven in 10 Americans think Congress should refrain from singling out Muslims and should investigate all religious extremism.<br />
<br />
Many American Muslims interpret King’s hearings as the culmination of years of growing domestic suspicions of their community, dating back to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.<br />
<br />
“For the last 10 years, there has been a movement of intolerance against Muslim Americans, but it hasn’t been above the surface,” says Patel, who leads the Interfaith Youth Corps.<br />
<br />
“It’s now clear, from everything from the discussion around the Cordoba House (one name for the proposed Islamic center) to the way King has framed the hearings that there is an anti-Muslim sentiment in America that is reminiscent of anti-Semitism and anti-Catholicism,” he said.<br />
<br />
“But I’d rather it be out in the open like it is now,” Patel continued<br />
<br />
According to the Department of Justice, there were 107 anti-Muslim hate-crime incidents in 2009, the most recent year for which statistics are available, up from 28 such incidents in 2000.<br />
<br />
With the 10-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the horizon and some likely contenders for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination talking up the threat of Islamic law, or sharia, taking hold in the United States, many Muslims fear the worst is to come.<br />
<br />
But many are also feeling that their community is finally preparing itself to take on those challenges.<br />
<br />
“This is a very American thing, congressional hearings,” says American University's Ahmed of next week’s King session. “Let’s present the complexity and sophistication of Islam so Americans understand it better. It’s a teaching moment.”<br />

			Update - 12:33PM PST: Very soon happens to be Today! Players can have their first look at the premiere update for Rift today (Saturday 3/5/11) starting @ 2:00PM PST!<br />
<br />
We’re already hard at work on Rift’s first major update and soon we will need your help! We will be temporarily opening the Alpha test shard for all players with an active subscription very soon, here you will be able to have a firsthand look at all the new content and improvements we have in the wings.<br />
<br />
Alpha will only be open during certain periods so be sure to check it out and give your feedback when you can! Of course, being a test shard means that at times things will not go as planned – expect bugs, bumps, and frequent maintenance.<br />
<br />
While you can’t copy your characters, those who played on Alpha before headstart will find their characters are still available. Lastly, try to avoid sharing spoilers across the forums; many players enjoy learning and discovering the game on their own, we appreciate your understanding.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help and feedback, we’re making Rift better together – have fun!<br />
<br />
Start patching today –<a href="http://update2.triongames.com/patcher/public/alpha/rift-alpha.exe" target="_blank"> Download the Alpha Client</a><br />
<br />
If you still have your client installed from pre-headstart Alpha testing, don't re-download the game. Simply launch Alpha and patch up!<br />
<br />
You’ll find the latest notes in the patcher!

<br />
I'm making a thread about it because a few are offering the game at $48 instead of $60. So if you didn't already get the special edition you can save some money.<br />
<br />
Amazon has the price set to $48 as default, while Direct2Drive has a promo code &quot;burnout&quot; (I believe) to get this price.<br />
<br />
Please note I have not used either of these services, and can't vouch for their reliability.</div>

			He's given bits and pieces of these speeches before: The Army needs to shift from a garrison peacetime force that's preparing for a possible head-on armored clash against a foe of comparable strength to a mobile force that's fighting actual &quot;asymmetric&quot; wars against rogue states and insurgents. The Air Force needs to pull back from its traditional obsession with high-tech air-to-air combat and focus more on joint operations—surveillance, precise air strikes, cargo transport, and rapid rescue—that help the troops on the ground. The Navy needs to focus less on aircraft carriers and more on vessels that can maneuver in coastal waters.<br />
Advertisement<br />
<br />
In short, as he put it in these most recent speeches, the &quot;defense bureaucracy,&quot; with its &quot;parochial tendencies&quot; and &quot;institutional constipation,&quot; must abandon its &quot;nostalgia&quot; for Cold War ways and adapt to the modern, messy world. The Pentagon has to learn the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan, and incorporate those lessons into its culture.

			But the reforms are far from complete, and, as Gates put it in his West Point speech, &quot;the tendency of any big bureaucracy is to revert to business as usual at the first opportunity.&quot; For the military, &quot;that opportunity is, if not peacetime, then the unwinding of sustained combat&quot;—which is already underway in Iraq and will be in the next few years in Afghanistan. If Gates really does leave this year, as he has said he'd like to do, then the first steps of this bureaucratic relapse could coincide with his last steps out the door.<br />
Some in the defense world are incredulous that Gates might leave with so much of his legacy as yet unsettled. But part of this incompletion is of Gates' own making. For better or for worse (and probably for a bit of both), Gates has never wanted the total overhaul that his rhetoric has at times suggested. As he emphasized in both of his recent speeches, he has never called for the elimination of heavy armor or fighter planes or aircraft carriers. To the contrary, his budgets have added, and continue to add, billions of dollars for these sorts of weapons. He has slashed or killed some of the services' most cherished programs (the Air Force's F-22 fighter plane, the Army's Future Combat Systems, the Navy's DDG-1000 destroyer), but he has boosted alternative programs that perform the same mission. He has pursued efficiencies, sometimes in rapier fashion, and he has forced the services to take on new missions. But he has rarely ordered them to drop the missions that they've long cherished.

			STORY HIGHLIGHTS<ul><li>Navy Petty Officer Stephen Jones says he fell asleep in his bed with another sailor while watching television</li>
<li>His roommate caught the two sailors sleeping and reported them to supervisors</li>
<li>The NAVY has said the sleepover is a violation and unprofessional</li>
</ul><br />
<b>(CNN) -- A sailor is accusing the Navy of baselessly trying to discharge him for &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; in an effort to get around the recent &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; repeal, after being found asleep in the same bed with another male sailor.</b><br />
<br />
Navy Petty Officer Stephen Jones, a student at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Charleston, South Carolina told CNN that on the night of February 5, a male sailor stopped by to watch the CW TV show &quot;Vampire Diaries&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;He has come over to watch shows in the past,&quot; said Jones. <br />
<br />
<b>The two watched the show on his bed but accidentally fell asleep</b>. Jones says his roommate walked in around midnight. <br />
<br />
&quot;My roommate walked in and it woke me up,&quot; said Jones. He then woke up his friend, Navy Petty Officer Bryan McGee, who according to Jones, immediately left the room.<br />
<br />
But the Navy is proceeding with discharging Jones, charging him with &quot;willful failure to exhibit professional conduct,&quot; Jones' lawyer, Greg Myers said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a violation of the Command Instruction for sailors to act unprofessionally in the barracks. It is considered unprofessional conduct to share the same bed in Navy barracks,&quot; said Thomas Dougan, a spokesman for the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command. <br />
<br />
Jones, who claims nothing sexual happened, said they were both clothed, him in pajama pants and a white t-shirt and McGee in boxers, and that two were not under the covers together. Jones was lying above the covers while McGee lay below. <br />
<br />
The play-by-play given by Jones is substantiated by the Naval investigating documents, although a different account on the amount of clothing worn was given by Jones' roommate who claimed in his naval statement that both sailors were only dressed in their boxers.<br />
<br />
Jones' roommate, who was uncomfortable by what he saw, according to Myers, Jones' attorney, moved out of the room a day later and reported the incident to command officials. An investigation was launched, ending with the Command attempting to punish Jones and McGee by a &quot;Captain's Mast,&quot; a non-judicial procedure meant to avoid a court martial.<br />
<br />
McGee, who declined to comment on the case, accepted the mast and punishment but Jones refused, moving the Navy to begin proceedings to discharge him. Punishment by Captain's Mast could have resulted in loss of rank, forfeiture of pay, or jeopardized Jones' top secret security clearance, Myers said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not pleading guilty to something that I didn't do. I did not commit a crime,&quot; said Jones. &quot;I am the type of person that takes responsibility for my actions. If I break a rule, I take my punishment. And I know I did not break any rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
Myers also said he is adamant that no crime was committed.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the end, Jones was charged with falling asleep while watching a show on his computer while on his bed over the covers where another man under the covers was also sleeping. This is not a crime and never will be as there was and is no duty to avoid such a circumstance as a matter of laws,&quot; said Myers in a statement sent to the Navy. <br />
<br />
Jones and his lawyer charge that the Naval Command suspects Jones of being gay and wants to discharge him for that reason alone. <br />
<br />
&quot;This Command suspects that Jones is a homosexual but has no proof. It cannot invoke 'don't ask, don't tell' because there is no homosexual conduct and there is no admission of homosexuality. Yet this homophobic Command is using its suspicions to reach the same result as though there were,&quot; said Myers. &quot;This is bigotry disguised as the rule of law.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jones would not comment on his sexual orientation saying, &quot;that is my business and my business alone&quot;.<br />
<br />
President Obama signed the so-called &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; repeal into law in December but it's not officially off the books until Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President give the OK that the military is ready to implement the repeal.<br />
<br />
For now, the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy remains in place, although no military personnel have been discharged under that policy since October, when Gates changed procedures to have such separations reviewed at the highest levels, a point, Myers says, was not forgotten by the Naval Command. <br />
<br />
&quot;The Secretary of Defense has said that 'don't ask, don't tell' cases will be reviewed at the highest levels. This case is disguised as misconduct to avoid that result,&quot; said Myers. &quot;This is a subterfuge being used by this Commander because he does not have the elements of proof to separate him for homosexuality, but he suspects homosexuality, so he has created this illusion that Stephen has engaged in misconduct of some form.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Navy denies the separation proceedings are based on the suspicion of homosexual behavior.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naval Nuclear Power Training Command is not administratively processing either of these sailors for separation based on sexual orientation,&quot; said Dougan.<br />
<br />
But one gay rights group worries this case may be an example of some in the military trying to get around the &quot;don't ask don't tell&quot; repeal by charging suspected homosexuals with other offenses.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've seen this before,&quot; said Alex Nicholson, executive director of Servicemembers United, the nation's largest organization of gay and lesbian troops and veterans. &quot;Here is the classic text book case of trumping up charges and exaggerating an event to try to punish someone. And this is exactly what the senior defense leadership has said would not and should not happen when DADT goes away.&quot;<br />
<br />
For now, the 21-year-old Jones says that even though he is disappointed in the Naval Command, he just wants to keep his job and finish his training to become a nuclear operator on an aircraft carrier or a submarine. <br />
<br />
&quot;I enjoyed my job. I enjoyed the environment and I was interested in what I was learning. It has been challenging but it was definitely something that I wanted to complete,&quot; said Jones.

			STORY HIGHLIGHTS<ul><li>Have whites become America's racially oppressed majority?</li>
<li>Scholars: More whites co-opting rhetoric of civil rights movement</li>
<li>Conservatives say nation is moving past racism</li>
<li>White scholar: White no longer defines being American</li>
</ul><br />
(CNN) -- They marched on Washington to reclaim civil rights.<br />
<br />
They complained of voter intimidation at the polls.<br />
<br />
They called for ethnic studies programs to promote racial pride.<br />
<br />
They are, some say, the new face of racial oppression in this nation -- and their faces are white.<br />
<br />
&quot;We went from being a privileged group to all of a sudden becoming whites, the new victims,'' says Charles Gallagher, a sociologist at La Salle University in Pennsylvania who researches white racial attitudes and was baffled to find that whites see themselves as a minority.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have this perception out there that whites are no longer in control or the majority. Whites are the new minority group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Call it racial jujitsu: A growing number of white Americans are acting like a racially oppressed majority. They are adopting the language and protest tactics of an embattled minority group, scholars and commentators say.<br />
<br />
They point to these signs of racial anxiety:<br />
<blockquote>• A recent Public Religion Research Institute poll found 44% of Americans surveyed identify discrimination against whites as being just as big as bigotry aimed at blacks and other minorities. The poll found 61% of those identifying with the Tea Party held that view, as did 56% of Republicans and 57% of white evangelicals.<br />
<br />
• More colleges are offering courses in &quot;Whiteness Studies&quot; as white Americans cope with becoming what one commentator calls a &quot;dispossessed majority group.&quot;<br />
<br />
• A Texas group recently formed the &quot;Former Majority Association for Equality&quot; to offer college scholarships to needy white men. Colby Bohannan, the group's president, says white men don't have scholarship options available to minorities. &quot;White males are definitely not a majority&quot; anymore, he says.<br />
<br />
• U.S. Census Bureau projections that whites will become a minority by 2050 are fueling fears that whiteness no longer represents the norm. This fear has been compounded by the recent recession, which hit whites hard.<br />
<br />
• Conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh argued in a radio show that Republicans are an &quot;oppressed minority&quot; in need of a &quot;civil rights movement&quot; because its members willingly sit in the &quot;back of the bus&quot; and &quot;are afraid of the fire hoses and the dogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
• Fox talk-show host Glenn Beck led a march on Washington (attended primarily by white people) to &quot;restore honor,&quot; and once called President Obama a racist with a &quot;deep-seated hatred for white people and white culture.&quot; He later said he regretted making that comment.<br />
<br />
• Conservative news outlets ran a number of stories last summer highlighting an incident from the 2008 elections, in which activists from the New Black Panther Party appeared to be intimidating voters at a polling place. Those claims were never proven.</blockquote>Mass rallies in Washington, voter intimidation at the polls, creating ethnic studies programs at colleges to promote racial self-awareness -- it sounds like a script from a civil rights documentary.<br />
<br />
But not everyone buys that script. Mona Charen, a conservative columnist for the National Review, challenges that view with this question: If more white Americans feel like an embattled minority, why did they elect President Barack Obama?<br />
<br />
&quot;Did they become racist after electing the first black president?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
Charen says the United States today is &quot;incredibly tolerant and open.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure, she says, there are individuals who nurture racial animosity, but most Americans deserve praise for looking past race.<br />
<br />
The proof, she says, isn't just in the fact that the nation elected its first black president. She cites the rise of more interracial couples.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I grew up, it was incredibly rare to see interracial couples,&quot; she says. &quot;People would turn their heads on the streets. Now it's so common that no one notices it anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>When white is no longer the norm</b><br />
<br />
The notion that many white Americans feel anxious about their race is not new. Today, however, economic anxieties are feeding those racial fears, says Tim Wise, author of &quot;White Like Me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wise says the recession hit blue-collar, white Americans hard, financially and psychologically.<br />
<br />
Many white Americans have lived under the assumption that if they worked hard, they would be rewarded. Now more white Americans are sharing unemployment lines with &quot;those people&quot; -- black and brown, Wise says.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the first time since the Great Depression, white Americans have been confronted with a level of economic insecurity that we're not used to,&quot; he says. &quot;It's not so new for black and brown folks, but for white folks, this is something we haven't seen since the Depression.&quot;<br />
<br />
Economic insecurity is what Colby Bohannan says convinced him to form the &quot;Former Majority Association for Equality.&quot; The association is awarding $500 scholarships to five deserving white men because they aren't eligible for scholarships reserved for women and minorities, he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Living in America, you hear about this minority or that minority, but it's never been used in the same sense for Caucasian Americans,&quot; Bohannan says. &quot;There was no one for white males until we came around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bohannan says the formation of his group was not motivated by racism, nor will it accept donations from hate groups.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not trying to promote racial bigotry,&quot; Bohannan says. &quot;All we're about is helping college students trying to better their lives who happen to be white males.&quot;<br />
<br />
Some white Americans not only feel ignored in higher education; they feel excluded by popular culture.<br />
<br />
The face of America is changing, says Wise, author of &quot;White Like Me.&quot; American culture has become so multicultural that many of the nation's icons -- including celebrities, sports heroes, and other leaders -- are people of color.<br />
<br />
&quot;The very definition of being an American is going through a profound change,&quot; Wise says. &quot;We can no longer take it for granted that we (whites) are the dictionary definition of an American.&quot;<br />
<br />
This racial unease is more pronounced among older white Americans, who grew up in an era where America's icons were virtually all white, Wise says.<br />
<br />
&quot;The idea that we're losing our country is something that's not going to have a lot of resonance for someone under 30,&quot; Wise says. &quot;These are white folks who don't remember the country that their parents are talking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
With white no longer the norm, more white Americans are hitting the books to ask a question that few felt a need to ask before: What does it mean to be white?<br />
<br />
&quot;Whiteness Studies&quot; began popping up in a few isolated academic institutions in the 1990s. Now such programs can be found in places such as the University of Wisconsin and the University of Utah. These courses examine what whiteness has meant during different periods of American history.<br />
<br />
For many decades, white people saw themselves as individuals, not as members of a race, says Matt Wray, a sociologist at Temple University in Pennsylvania, who writes books about white studies.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are often offended if someone calls attention to our race as shaping how we view the world,&quot; says Wray, author of &quot;Not Quite White.&quot; &quot;We don't like to be pigeon-holed that way. Non-white Americans are seldom afforded this luxury of seeing themselves as individuals, disconnected from any race.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, Wray says anxiety among whites over their place in America is nothing new. Some 19th century whites worried about slave revolts. During segregation. some worried about blacks they labeled as &quot;uppity Negroes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whites have never really felt terribly secure in their majority status,&quot; he says. &quot;It's often said that it is lonely at the top, but it's also an anxious place to be, because you live in constant fear of falling.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>'Diversity is not strength'</b><br />
<br />
Some white commentators are unapologetic about this racial anxiety.<br />
<br />
Peter Brimelow, author of &quot;Alien Nation: Common Sense About America's Immigration Disaster,&quot; asserts that much of white America's anxiety derives from living under a black president and changing demographics.<br />
<br />
Diversity, he says, &quot;is not strength.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brimelow's website, VDARE.COM, has been described as a hate site by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that tracks extremist groups in the U.S.<br />
<br />
Some may see him as extreme, but Brimelow argues in his columns that more white Americans are moving toward his stance on immigration and other issues.<br />
<br />
He cites as proof the rise of the Tea Party movement and the racial makeup of Beck's march on Washington. He says more whites recognize, even if it's only on a subliminal level, that they have common interests to defend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, they would deny this, quite sincerely, if you put it to them because the idea of whites defending their interests as whites is quite new,&quot; he says. &quot;Americans are trained to think that any explicit defense of white interests is 'racist.' &quot;<br />
<br />
James Edwards, host of the &quot;Political Cesspool&quot; radio show, isn't shy about naming those interests. He says white Americans have become the &quot;dispossessed majority&quot; and that coming demographic changes may turn the United States into a &quot;Third-World flop-house.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwards, who is considered a white nationalist by the Southern Poverty Law Center, says whites must organize like other stigmatized groups.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is nothing wrong for Jewish organizations to promote the self-interest of Jews or black organizations to promote the interest of blacks,&quot; he says. &quot;There is no organization to stand up to advance the interests of the dispossessed majority.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those white interests have been compromised by what he sees as the &quot;preferential treatment&quot; blacks have received in the job market to compensate for slavery, Edwards says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever mistakes might have been made in our pasts, they have not only been corrected, but they've been overcompensated for,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
Now whites are victims of pervasive racism, Edwards says.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're the victims of it every day. Anything a white conservative does that a liberal doesn't like is called racism.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Brimelow and Edwards reject outright the Southern Poverty Law Center's description of their organizations as extremist.<br />
<br />
<b>'It's not a race issue, it's a principle'</b><br />
<br />
Ginger Howard is a white Southerner who doesn't feel dispossessed. She attended Beck's rally last summer and described it as a religious event, not a political one.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was such an amazing event to be with such like-minded people,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
Beck says he held the rally to reclaim the civil rights movement &quot;from politics.&quot; He held the rally on the anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &quot;I Have Dream Speech.&quot;<br />
<br />
Howard says she attended because she wanted to raise money for U.S. troops and protest against government dependency.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a race issue, it's a principle issue,&quot; says Howard, owner of the Ginger Howard Selections clothing store in Atlanta, Georgia.<br />
<br />
Chris Plante, a conservative talk show host, says white racial anxiety isn't a race issue but a smokescreen by leftists. Plante says they yell racism to avoid talking about Obama's &quot;unpopular liberal expansion&quot; of the federal government.<br />
<br />
Plante, who says he grew up in a Chicago home with a picture of Martin Luther King Jr. on the wall, attended both Beck's rally and a follow-up rally by Jon Stewart, host of the Daily Show.<br />
<br />
Stewart and fellow Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert held their &quot;March to Keep Fear Alive&quot; on the National Mall two months after Beck's rally. Stewart said he held the rally for people tired of the media portraying America as a divided country.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Beck crowd was no more white than the Jon Stewart rally, but nobody in the news media described the Stewart crowd as overwhelmingly white,&quot; Plante says.<br />
<br />
<b>'Hunkering down'</b><br />
<br />
One prominent observer of American culture suggests all Americans -- white, black and every other minority -- should be concerned about the future.<br />
<br />
Robert Putnam, author of the celebrated book, &quot;Bowling Alone,&quot; says his studies of multiracial neighborhoods in America suggest that more diversity doesn't initially create more tolerance. It can erode community.<br />
<br />
In his 2007 book, &quot;E Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in the Twenty-first Century,&quot; Putnam says his studies of diverse communities show that in the short run, its members tend to expect the worst, distrust neighbors and withdraw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Residents of all races tend to 'hunker down,' '' Putnam writes. &quot;Trust (even of one's own race) is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friends fewer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this America's future?<br />
<br />
Dueling mass rallies in Washington? Dueling complaints of racial persecution? Dueling versions of ethnic history?<br />
<br />
It doesn't have to be, says Gallagher, the La Salle University sociologist.<br />
<br />
Gallagher points out that the United States has accommodated massive change before. Women were once thought too emotional to vote, interracial couples were outlawed, blacks enslaved.<br />
<br />
He says his children won't see race the same way that he or other generations did. They won't see diversity as a weakness.<br />
<br />
It'll just be a way of life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like it or not, the country is going to look more like it should -- more brown folks, more yellow folks, more gay folks, more mixed folks,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
It's easy to be pessimistic, he says, but his profession teaches him to look past the headlines.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you take the long view of human history, change is slow, but change happens.&quot;

<div>I'm so happy. I don't watch tv much lately, and on a complete lark I got bored and decided to watch the original Star Trek movie on the sci-fi channel this afternoon. (actual sci-fi on the sci-fi channel, a shocker I know)<br />
<br />
During one of the commercial breaks I saw a teaser for Stargate Universe. This monday (March 7th) marks the beginning of a set of 10 episodes that end the series.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't like the show, just imagine how amazing this is. How often do shows get canceled, and then still get enough funding to finish the story for fans? I think Sci-Fi actually deserves a little bit of respect for this.</div>
