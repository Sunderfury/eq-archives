		<div>Ok, I have a question.<br />
<br />
Given that there are so many awesome looking AAs, is the general consensus still to level up to 80 and then get the AAs?  If so, I'm going to have to be really stingy on what I pick up with the initial 30 AAs!<br />
<br />
What are some popular theories on 'must have from the get-go' AAs?  All the agro-reduction stuff looks really nice (SCS 4-6 &amp; Hastened Silent Casting and to some extent Mind Crash 4-6) - but it doesn't seem like they will be necessary for the grind and I can live without them the first couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
What's going to help me grind to 80 and the AAs the most?  I'm thinking that I can do without a 10th spell gem or the AA invis for now (wrong? well 3 points for the AA invis sounds well worth it), and my current game plan is to power level to 80 but stop at 77 to pick up 9 points for the upgraded flappy, how does that sound?<br />
<br />
So with my initial 30 points I'd get:<br />
<br />
1) Harvest of Druzzil 2 (6 points)<br />
2) GoERM (9 points)<br />
3) Spell Casting Fury Mastery 11 (7 points)<br />
4) Spell Casting Fury Mastery 12 (9 points, so I'd have to get one more AA point)<br />
<br />
(Or, I can just get Harvest of Druzzil and 4 ranks of Quickened Harvest of Druzzil to make it a 4 minute 1.5k mana regen which sounds pretty nice... hehe)<br />
<br />
Thoughts? : )<br />

My guild is taking the first week of SoF off from raiding, so I'm not going to need SCS4-6 until after that.  And I'm not sure how long it takes to level in SoF when I only have about 3-4 hours each weeknight to level (and presumably all day Saturday/Sunday) : )<br />

We had a great hope for Acro, it is a debuff that is on the NPC side, this in turn seemed like a chance to have a self cast proc that would stack with MR. Unfortunately Nodyin says it cannot be done from coding side of things.<br />
<br />
Acro could stack with MR if you had a wiz use it in raid, other wiz but himself would get benefit from it and MR at the same time. I hope you understand what I mean.<br />

Then the issue of what would and would not stack with, this would also take a debuff slot on NPC and so on. All kinds of issues that seem to have Acro at a point of not being worth the bother.</div>

BTW, if you look at the spells available on vendors and their levels... GoERM won't help you level to 80 all that much because you will still be casting mostly pre-SoF spells. IMO it's better to buy the first 2 new ranks of SCFM and DF at lv 76 and 78 (that costs 32 AA total, so get 2 AA in process, it's a lot cheaper than regular xp anyway). And once you are lv 80 - then of course go ahead and knock yourself out with GoERM, new flappies, etc.</div>

Problem is it does not stack with MR. If you don't have MR any of these 3 will help, Acro being the best of the 3.</div>

I'm thinking from now on I'm going to tell enchanters to let me have Arco up until it procs and then put MR on me.  That'd be the most bang for the buck no?  But it requires some micro-management.<br />

<br />
First it will proc on anyone's nuke and not just yours. With 5 hits max in raid you are likely never going to see it benefit you.<br />
<br />
Second, to get a proc you need to give up MR. New MR Rk3 will give you 1974 extra damage per nuke on avarage. It is hard jutifying blocking it off for any part of the fight.</div>

		<div>The only reason not using MR is if there happens to be enough wizards, enchanters, and mages to take up all possible casts of MR, with one or more persons left over.  You'd gain more dps having that 1 person left over be a wizard to use Arcomancy (or pyromancy, cryomancy for that matter).  MR on a mage or enchanter loses 6% of its damage (about 28 dps with TSS MR) compared to a wizard, but Arcomancy would add more than 28 dps to the raid.<br />
<br />
Of course, there is always the idea that arcomancy's -50 MR would help all magic spells land better and net the raid a much larger potential damage than MR, regardless of the lost DPS from putting MR somewhere other than wizard.<br />
<br />
In fact, I'd bet if you parsed resist rates, having 1 wizard use pyromancy, cryomancy, or arcomancy to reduce resists for the rest of the raid, you'd find that raid dps goes up compared to having that wizard use MR.  But it doesn't look pretty on a dps parse.</div>

Enchanters are also getting MR aura. They will not have to MR self anymore. It should also work fine for necros and mags. It was balanced in such a way to exclude wizards. Last I heard it was limited to 3 hits in 18 seconds.</div>

<br />
I still hold that 1 wizard casting pyromancy in a wizard/mage heavy raid outweighs the impact of MR on that wizard.  I *know* this was true through most of DoDh.  If you have 3 wizards and no one else using fire, and the -50 FR reduces resists by 3.3% (1 in 33 casts) then you gain dps using pyromancy versus MR.  Over a full raid of fire spell users, its ridiculously marginal how much the resist reduction has to be.  (When I was experimenting, our guild was set up such that &lt;1% reduction was needed to out dps MR).  That doesn't even include the ~75 dps you gain from pyromancy itself, just the FR reduction..</div>

		<div>Every DoT has a DD dmg as it lands, MR was fixed to work on that part. It procs for Necros when DoT lands first, 1 proc per DoT cast.<br />
<br />
As for resists, Instants brought to us HUGE gain in resists. You will cry when you cast Instant + Inizen's and see 5-10X more resists on Inizens than Instant. I did loads of parses in Beta and EI was still at -10 and it was a disgrace how many resists and partials i had and that on a Test Dummy in Arena.<br />
<br />
Acro debuffs magic, the value of that debuff is lot less important than fire/cold as it is the most debuffed resist. Also as it stands our Magic line is so inefficient that I cannot see sense in using CBb except for very special situations. That leaves you with either fire or cold strats and magic resist debuff thats not a great help.<br />
<br />
There are some questions about stacking too. Does the debuff stack with Tash? Malo? Would not be good if you were to take out one of them for such a short time debuff. Even if it does stack with the two, it must take a slot on the NPC. Remember that Necros are already crying that there are not enough on NPCs as is and that 3 or 4 necros have no way of stacking all their DoTs as it is.</div>

		<div>No, dots do not all have DD portions.  In fact, I don't think any current necro dots have a DD portion.  There were a few in the past.<br />
<br />
The debuffs from our 'mancies stacks with every caster debuff.  In response to your Acromancy comment, I specifically mentioned Pyromancy as the debuff of choice.  Pyro 6 is about 150 dps, with -50FR to boot; At 1000 damage a tick, that's on par with a necro dot.  If you happen to be in a situation where you're using CBS CBS EC, Acromancy would probably be the debuff of choice.<br />
<br />
With 5 necros, you're looking at 35 slots taken for dots.  There are 50 slots.  If you're capping out the slots with less than 5 necros on the raid, that means someone is casting something they don't need to be casting on the mob.  We had that problem at one point, in VT era I think.  Turned out, all the rangers were casting their crappy dots on the mob to boost their personal DPS scores.  After we started removing them from the raid for it, our raid dps went up significantly.</div>
