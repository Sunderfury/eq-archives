So in the spring my wife & I decided to split.  Not "divorced" though in the words of my ex, "that's just a formality at this point".  I should of course point out it's amicable.  No kids, we're still on good terms, communicate on a regular basis...  etc. etc etc..

So in the spring my wife &amp; I decided to split.  Not &quot;divorced&quot; though in the words of my ex, &quot;that's just a formality at this point&quot;.  I should of course point out it's amicable.  No kids, we're still on good terms, communicate on a regular basis...  etc. etc etc..<br />
<br />
<br />
So now, my brother, has not been feeling good all year, they finally 2 weeks ago did an abdominal CT.  Lesions on the liver consistent with cancer, mass on the adrenal, consistent with metastasized cancer.<br />
Biopsy of the liver reveals it to be colon cancer that has spread.  <br />
<br />
Life just keeps kicking you when you're down doesn't it?  and I suppose just because this is Rants we need some gratuitious &quot;Fuck the Fucking Fuckers mother ffucking cock sucking fucking fuckers!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck you world.</div>

Subscription apps that do not accept payment through google/apple gift cards are living business in an inverted model of what makes revenue generation successful. Why, as a business, that is interested in generating revenue from the use of products it already has written, published, and given out for free to use, DENY the entirety of a subscription because the subscription is not guaranteed to be continued? The forced subscription model of &quot;Well, let them subscribe, and then forget they have the subscription so we continue to take their money even if they've stopped using our product&quot; is a broken one.</div>
