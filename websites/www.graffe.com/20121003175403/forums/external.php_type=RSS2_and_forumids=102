			<description>A question for anyone with knowledge of how mobile data networks work.  I am on 3 in the uk and have all you can eat data on my plan, however tethering is an optional extra.  Would the network be able to detect if I am using the phone as a hotspot?</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I always get excited when I discover new cool stuff at work. For example, did you know you that in php can use print_r($variable, true) to get it to return a string instead of echo it? Awesome for debugging: error_log(print_r($problem_variable, true));.<br />
<br />
Today I was temporarily moving some relatively large gzipped tarballs (5-100GB backups of various servers) from our backup server to my desktop since it was having harddrive issues and I wanted to make sure I had backups of critical systems in case shit hit the fan. The backup server runs backuppc and in order to save space we compress all of the pooled files. However, since compressing takes a fair bit of CPU and we're backing up 20ish servers every night, we use the lightest (gzip -1) compression to compress it all. Well, I have limited disk space on my desktop, so I was uncompressing the files and recompressing with -9 (which saved 1-3GB on average) as I got them.<br />
<br />
Do you like gzip? Do you have a multicore machine? Do you gzip or un-gzip your files and think to yourself &quot;damn, this is slow, why won't it use all of my 16 cores?&quot; Then pigz is for you. Pigz is a drop in replacement for gzip which uses multiple threads (specified by the -p parameter, or if omitted, equal to the number of active CPUs on the machine) to do your work for you. I found I was I/O bound on decompression, but CPU bound when recompressing the file, but your mileage may vary depending on the compression level and power of the machine.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This is somewhat gross, but despite taking extremely good care of my electronics and maintaining them, hair inevitably ends up inbetween my keyboard keys (laptop).  I've tried passing a qtip between the keys to some success and blowing the hair out with compressed air, but neither have been completely successful in removing the debris.  The spacing is just narrow enough to make wiping the area down and getting underneath the keys themselves a pain.  The keyboard is taped down in Asus' infinite wisdom so it is not easily removed without reducing the tackiness of the tape.  I don't want the debris to end up underneath the frame and onto actual electronics is the main motivation for this.  I cleaned out the entire laptop a few months back (took it apart to install RAM, Asus made the 4th DIMM require taking apart the frame to access).  Aside from putting on a suit an computing in a clean room this sort of maintenance will be necessary.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I'm having major problems getting XBMC to recognize my TV shows, and I really don't want to change the way I sort/store them. I'm hoping maybe someone here ran into the same problem and found a solution.<br />
<br />
My TV shows are stored as such:<br />
<br />
X:\MP4\TV\<b>[TV Show Name]</b> Season <b>[Season Number]</b>\<b>[Episode Number]</b> Episode Title.m4v<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
X:\MP4\TV\Battlestar Galactica Season 1\01 33.m4v<br />
X:\MP4\TV\Battlestar Galactica Season 1\02 Water.m4v<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
I set up an advancedsettings.xml with the follow regex for my case of <b>[Season Number]</b>\<b>[Episode Number]</b>, as suggested by the XBMC wiki:<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Code:</div>
	<hr /><code class="bbcode_code">&lt;advancedsettings&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;tvshowmatching&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;regexp&gt;Season[\._ ]([0-9]+)[\\/]([0-9]+)[^\\/]*&lt;/regexp&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/tvshowmatching&gt;<br />
&lt;/advancedsettings&gt;</code><hr />
</div>However, that doesn't seem to help at all. It only finds some single-season TV shows, but not even any episodes for those.<br />
<br />
The files are already fully tagged for iTunes (names, numbers, description, rating, etc), but apparently XBMC still can't read MP4 video tags.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions other than simply sticking with iTunes for TV shows?</div>
