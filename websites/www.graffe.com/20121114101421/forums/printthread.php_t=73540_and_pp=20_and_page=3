		<blockquote class="restore">Another thing, I've rebound left-alt to tab as alt is rarely used in VIM and doing so allows me to use my thumb instead of my pinky for navigating autocompletion and ward off RSI.  Also, <a href="http://vimgolf.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://vimgolf.com/</a> is really cool regardless of whether you use emacs or vim or something else.  It's fun and wrinkles your brain while increasing your aptitude at a work skill.  Also Goladus, as someone who is primarily using Windows 7 for development atm I am finding using VIM (since it is focused on only succeeding at being a text editor) quite deficient when you are in a landscape where you do not have access to many exceptional utilities by default.  <br />
<br />
You can get around this fact in various ways using cygwin etc., but it's less than ideal still and quite a bear to do and due to some idiosyncracies with the windows command line, getting things like Vundle working in a vimrc is /weird/ and I have had to change a bunch of environment variables in windows to get it to realize I have certain programs installed like mlint and ack.  The reason the CLI wasteland is an issue over emacs in VIM is that it handicaps your ability to read output from commands into buffers, something that is essential.  Another thing, emacs has a sweet feature in slime that is replicated somewhat in VIM but it is only one-way in VIM and also there is not a tmux/screen terminal by default to use, which is what the slime plugin requires.  So, I think emacs is better if you are stuck in a windows environment for those reasons.<br />
<br />
Oh, another thing despite VIM's exceptional grammar and focus on having a sensible keybinding for a command and its inverse (such as p to put before a line, P to put after a line) such a concept does not exist by default with regard to transposing.  However, it's something that can be added somewhat easily with keybinding a sequence to a complex regex or grammar, which I mapped to [c ]c for characters, [w and ]w for words, [l and ]l for sentences, [&lt;space&gt; and ]&lt;space&gt; for adding new lines above or below lines.  Those keybinds were inspired due to the ]l, [l, [&lt;space&gt;, ]&lt;space mnemonic being put n by Tim Pope's unimpaired plugin though.<br />
<br />
Another area where emacs succeeds over VIM in usability/quickness is when it comes to interacting with files not in the current buffer via a macro/sequence of commands for performing some command on multiple files, especially those which are not loaded.  In Emacs it is pretty straightforward via using marks.  In VIM though instead of a 2 step process it is 2 to 3.  You first add those files as arguments,then add additional files potentially, and the use a separate command (argdo or bufdo depending on the context).  In the VIM context that adds up to a more bearish task.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Also, I will add that if you are suffering from insomnia that watching videos over text editors is a good solution.  One other layer of complexity in the VIM onion is the existence of multiple list buffers that are available and have a somewhat unique way of navigating the lists.  ATM I recall their being a quickfix list that contains compilation or syntax errors such as if you run a lint program on your code, a location list which remembers where you have been in a file so that you can quickly jump back or to a buffer and line and tab associated with a change in location or tag, a list of markers, registers, or command history.  Presently if seems like there is not a consistent grammar in terms of how these lists are utilized for navigation.  The quickfix list is what you will wind up explicitly using mostly though. The others are pretty transparent or only require remembering a couple of commands.  A list would probably be comparable to a ring in the emacs paradigm.<br />
<br />
The two editors really like stealing cool features from each other and other editors like Textmate for instance (bubbling text, snippets).  VIM's fugitive and surround has an emacs brother as an example, and VIM has imitators of dired and slime as well as the excellent easy motion that provides a visual method to jump to a location in a buffer in one to two strokes, very powerful.  Emacs slime has two-way communication with its Lisp though, where as the VIM slime's target isn't aware of the communicator and requires screen or tmux.  Emacs is a platform though where as VIM is a text editor as the saying goes. Sublime 2's fuzzy finder for docs is pretty interesting, not sure that it could work in the context of how VIM of emacs doc layout is done though <br />
 <br />
One more thing, a pro tip I received early on was to learn a few commands at a time using a post it note or whatever works for you, then move to some new info as you grasp the old mysteries so that you are more efficient and on the way to being a full on grey beard.  The low key amount of pop ups and animation and flashing appeals to me since it is much less distracting for myself like what writing on paper is instead of word.<br />
<br />
Additonally, if you use git and emacs or VIM, fugitive makes git stupidly easy/quick to use.  Combine that with snippets for ensuring your commit/bug comments are correctly stated (if you have some sort of keyword scheme used to indicate fixes) you have a pretty sleek work flow.  I'm pretty intoxicated from drinking the emacs/vim kool-aid at this point and don't even care.  It's like you discovers a unicorn that rode in on a rainbow and want to share the excitement with everyone. I'll probably delve into emacs hardcore next year as GNU software appeals to my inner nerd of yore and check out all the cool stuff it has like org mode.</blockquote>

I am really good at using VIM now, and pretty advanced.  I'm not a master at it but I am quite adept at its various features.  So, I'm learning emacs for the purpose of using it as a tight C dev environment with how well it is integrated with gdb.  I am finding emacs tremendously obtuse to learn though.  It seems the user base is far less motivated compared to vim and the amount of great screencasts isn't there.  Like vimcasts.org and derek wyatt have great videos showing off different features and great tools in VIM which were very helpful, emacs on the other hand doesn't seem to have those.  Videos that go through major modes to give an overview of t, show off how to do things efficiently etc.  Leaving me with reading through the built in user guide, which has been quite a slow and not as fun.  The emacs tutor session isn't as well done as vimtutor either, pretty tiny.  And your hands are on modifier keys very frequently, commands are very verbose where as in VIM it is 1 to 2 key presses at most  usually.  Hopefully it picks up.  Org mode is very well documented though.</blockquote>

</div>Alright, I am going to say something that I think most of you will disagree with, but the more I use VIM/Evil and research it, find great resources the more I consider VIM very easy to gain great proficiency in.  I was hesitant to say this before, but after reading Drew Neil's <i>Practical VIM</i> he does such an excellent job of informing the readers of all the features and the various editor paradigms that it is super trivial to access and become adept at these insanely powerful features that no other editor has.  I think it's kind of boneheaded to not use EVIL or VIM at this point if you write a lot of papers/programs now.  Beforehand I thought the learning curve was madness, but it's really not.  Why? While VIM has an incredibly powerful and nuanced system in place with many individual key maps, pretty much in all cases those key maps have a pattern about them that you can chain together, and this is consistent through out, so the material you have to learn is very small.  Emacs is kind of a cluster fuck, but VIM/EVIL is really terse and excellently designed.  I went though the Practical VIM book that Neil wrote, and EVIL surpisingly already has a great deal of the VIM features implemented, even some of the advanced ones.  The things not supported though you have Emacs alternatives for in various ways, so I think this is an exceptional utility to learn, and it will really save your hands.  I consider it one of the best expenditures of time to learn ever, and I use it every day.  I use Emacs as my primary editor now, but learning VIM's concepts let me go straight into EVIL without losing speed really.  I'm still absorbing Emacs stuff, which I am finding very nontrivial to grok, but it's super powerful.  The main thing is I need to microoptimize the layouts more and become more proficient at elisp etc.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, here is my suggestions for becoming pro at VIM and improving your life forever.<br />
1) Do vimtutor <br />
2) Watch vimcasts and follow along<br />
3) Read Practical VIM<br />
4) Use it for all of your editing so that using all the features is seamless<br />
<br />
Even just after doing the first step you will likely be way faster than your previous methodology.  After doing the other 2 you will be pro.  I did watch all of Derek Wyatt's videos but I don't consider them worth doing now due to the awesome stuff pointed out in those (like Ctrl-O for doing one Normal mode action while in Insert mode) is covered in a much terser format in Neil's book.  I cannot hype it enough; it is one of the best technical books I have ever read and opened my eyes to some things I had overlooked like the expression register in VIM (EVIL does not have this sadly, but emacs has it covered in other ways).  I bought the book for some of my nerdier friends who are more willing to invest in learning new skills and they have all loved it.  <br />
<br />
The more GUI obsessed nerds are not down for learning this at all though, so they cannot be helped.  Emacs is awesome though, but is brutal and not as well documented or accessible as VIM is, so it's harder to grasp but it is much more powerful, especially once you add EVIL to the mix.  It's an unstoppable combo and state of the art IMO.  Elisp, org mode, micro optimization, EVIL, autocomplete, development for all languages which is especially useful for those that have shoddy IDEs still, snippets, refactoring, multithreaded, great toolchain for development, comint/slime, it's perfect and amazing.  The best program of all time IMO, especially on UNIX.  I'm loving it.  I would like to add in some pedals and a different keyboard into the mix, but I solely use my laptop and I work in different spots so it is not worth carrying all the extra baggage for me.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I redact my previous comment about VIM's expression register and EMACS.  It turns out that EMACS has quite an exceptional complement (even better perhaps, I certainly think so) to VIM's expression register feature.  EMACS has a built-in calculator (M-x calc) that is capable of quite advanced things, even complicated tasks like taking derivatives, integrals, solving a set of linear equations, and matrices.  The calculator uses the superior RPN too, so infix notation is avoided (infix is complete shit but I digress).  And EVIL supports dumping the literal contents of a register into the current point in the buffer.  Also, I found out recently that Org Mobile is supported and developed for Android, but there is no up to date equivalent for iOS which sucks a lot as Org Mode is brilliantly done, and being able to use that without having to break out a laptop would be panty dropping greatness.<br />

			<div class="message">The Gentoo box behind me runs XFCE when I actually log it into the GUI.  it mostly sits there to serve my terabyte drives to the network with Samba.  Sometimes I check in on it from my Mac Book using SSH though.(I use the Mac Book because it will SSH without additional software,  MS seems to not have SSH built in.  Naturally one can use Putty but still rather sad that with how common SSH is that its not just part of Windows.)</div>

</div>That summarizes my feelings in a lot of situations when it comes to Microsoft's OS line.  There  is a great deal of software that while common is not available by default, or if it is it is in the Silver Humpback Super Duper Professional Version (which naturally was the name for but one of their 500 OS flavors).</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">It's really nice being able to use emacs for everything.  Even niche or new languages that do not have a good IDE for them work well in the emacs environment.  For example, Scala and GO are well supported by emacs packages.  I don't think emacs is nearly as nice for writing programs for microcontrollers though.  As the IDE we used in my microprocessor class I had when doing my BSEE was very nice.  You could see the values of registers, stack, stack pointer, ports, the different memory addresses, etc. all in one window.  The text editor was really shit but everything else was so nice that it made up for it.  If you do disassembly IDA Pro is too nice to pass up though, but for the majority of cases emacs is exceptional, a great tool for sure.  I wish it was not impossibly steep to learn though as it could help a lot of people.</blockquote>
