Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Gulf War Illness Revealed by 31Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: A Case-Control Study <br />
 Hayley J. Koslik,   Gavin Hamilton,   Beatrice A. Golomb mail   <br />
<br />
Published: March 27, 2014<br />
•DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092887<br />
<br />
Abstract<br />
<br />
Background<br />
<br />
Approximately 1/3 of 1990-1 Gulf War veterans developed chronic multisymptom health problems. Implicated exposures bear mechanisms that adversely affect mitochondria. Symptoms emphasize fatigue, cognition and muscle (brain and muscle are aerobically demanding); with protean additional domains affected, compatible with mitochondrial impairment. Recent evidence supports treatments targeting cell bioenergetics (coenzyme10) to benefit Gulf War illness symptoms. However, no evidence has directly documented mitochondrial or bioenergetic impairment in Gulf War illness.<br />
<br />
Objective<br />
<br />
We sought to objectively assess for mitochondrial dysfunction, examining post-exercise phosphocreatine-recovery time constant (PCr-R) using 31Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P-MRS), in Gulf War veterans with Gulf War illness compared to matched healthy controls. PCr-R has been described as a “robust and practical” index of mitochondrial status.<br />
<br />
Design and Participants<br />
<br />
Case-control study from 2012–2013. Fourteen community-dwelling Gulf War veterans and matched controls from the San Diego area comprised 7 men meeting CDC and Kansas criteria for Gulf War illness, and 7 non-deployed healthy controls matched 1:1 to cases on age, sex, and ethnicity.<br />
<br />
Outcome Measure<br />
<br />
Calf muscle phosphocreatine was evaluated by 31P-MRS at rest, through 5 minutes of foot pedal depression exercise, and in recovery, to assess PCr-R. Paired t-tests compared cases to matched controls.<br />
<br />
Results<br />
<br />
PCr-R was significantly prolonged in Gulf War illness cases vs their matched controls: control values, mean±SD, 29.0±8.7 seconds; case values 46.1±18.0 seconds; difference 17.1±14.9 seconds; p = 0.023. PCr-R was longer for cases relative to their matched controls for all but one pair; moreover while values clustered under 31 seconds for all but one control, they exceeded 35 seconds (with a spread up to 70 seconds) for all but one case.<br />
<br />
Discussion<br />
<br />
These data provide the first direct evidence supporting mitochondrial dysfunction in Gulf War illness. Findings merit replication in a larger study and/or corroboration with additional mitochondrial assessment tools<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Introduction<br />
<br />
Of the ~700,000 US troops deployed to the 1990-1 Persian Gulf theater, an estimated 175,000–250,000 (~1/4–1/3 of those deployed), developed chronic multisymptom health problems often termed “Gulf War illness” (GWI) [1]. GWI is characterized by protean symptoms spanning multiple symptom “domains” (such as cognitive, fatigue, musculoskeletal). Gulf deployed veterans on average have more symptom domains affected, and greater severity and multiplicity of symptoms within domains, than Gulf era veterans who were not deployed [2]. Fatigue, exercise intolerance, cognitive difficulties, muscle pain and weakness, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal problems, sleep problems, behavior change, neurological findings, and skin problems are all elevated. GWI is defined by symptoms; a number of objective findings have been replicated, such as autonomic dysfunction, increased autoantibodies, reduced natural killer cell activity, and increased coagulation activation among others [3]. Studies generally show that affected veterans have not improved with time [4], [5], [6]; Gulf War veterans (GWV) continue to experience symptoms and impaired function 23 years later.<br />
<br />
GWI is not equivalent to signature conditions of subsequent deployments to the region, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury. Indeed, stress and combat are demonstrably not the cause. While combat stress bears a dose-response relation to posttraumatic stress disorder (including in GWV); it bears no significant relationship to GWI in studies that adjust for other exposures [4]. Environmental factors are clearly inculpated in GWI. Many exposures were new, unique or excessive in the Gulf War. These include heat, sand, depleted uranium tanks/munitions, chemical agent resistant coating paint, and oil fires; as well as protections such as high numbers of multiple vaccines, anthrax vaccine, pyridostigmine bromide nerve agent pretreatment pills, pesticides and insect repellents, and permethrin-impregnated uniforms among others. Evidence most strongly implicates acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEi) related exposures (which adhere to Hill's criteria for causality, include a dose-response relationship, and are buttressed by gene-exposure interaction data) [7]. Multiple vaccinations and anthrax vaccine also show relatively consistent epidemiological associations, but do not have the triangulating evidence for causality. AChEi related exposures include (carbamate) pyridostigmine bromide nerve agent pretreatment pills, given to an estimated 250,000 US troops [8]; carbamate and organophosphate pesticides [9], used aggressively and sometimes excessively to protect against insect vectors of disease [10], [11]; and organophosphate nerve gas, to which the Department of Defense estimates as many as ~100,000 US troops were exposed in association with the demolition of the Khamisiyah munitions depot [12], with other possible nerve agent exposures [13]. Number of exposures experienced has also been linked to illness [14]; and exposure interactions, conceptually and empirically, may produce more problems [15].<br />
<br />
The involvement of AChEi provides important information regarding potential mechanisms. Whereas AChEi toxicity is often viewed in terms of acetylcholinesterase inhibition, evidence shows that toxicity and lethality in fact relate decisively to (intertwined) oxidative stress (OS) and mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) [16] (phenomena that are tightly intertwined because the mitochondria are a leading target and source of reactive oxygen species [17], [18], [19]): indeed, animal evidence shows that high quality antioxidants administered just before or just after organophosphate pesticide exposure protect against lethality and chronic sequelae [20], [21]. We have shown that a mechanism involving OS-MD would explain the symptom profile (including which symptoms dominate – fatigue as well as central nervous system and muscle symptoms dominate in MD), symptom multiplicity, protean symptom character, variable latency to onset of symptoms, and the objective markers linked to GWI [3]. This mechanism would also provide for a subsidiary role for multiple other exposures for which mechanisms of action are classically considered to be unrelated, but which share in common induction of OS – potentiating MD and further OS. Figure 1 depicts the mechanism we propose.<br />

and for the record, Wessely DID state that GWS *was* psychological until a UK inquiry said otherwise, so he had to change his story.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I got wrapped into watching these videos about Nal_rA (Kang Min) attempting to come back in SC1 in 2010 to pro levels. <br />
<br />
The videos themselves are really intriguing and interesting to me, but being unfamiliar with SK culture and the nuance of the people's tone lost on me as well due to not understanding Korean at all and not being able to read their body language sometimes, I was hoping one of you could clarify a scene that occurs in episode 4 around the 6 minute mark (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLC405E5A51F52ADC4&amp;v=YGT5onsTaFI#t=344" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?featur...5onsTaFI#t=344</a>) when Nal_rA is about to have lunch. <br />
<br />
Are the other people joking with him about eating with him or not? <br />
<br />
It seems like they may be but everyone at the table is so calmly dismissive of him when expressing very low opinions/dispositions about him and his role that they may be not joking. I cannot really read them well for aforementioned reasons like I normally would and infer what is happening in the scene accurately. <br />
<br />
Overall, I just felt really sad for him in the series and his situation/interactions with other people despite Kang Min seeming like a really great person overall but having such difficulties with receiving comparable resources to the time current pro gamers in the videos. <br />
<br />
He often has to essentially harass people into aiding his efforts and is socially estranged, and in a lot of ways a dysfunctional person, worse than even some college freshman at being able to do basic things for themselves. <br />
<br />
He's not ever in an unavoidably dire situation really, the apparent isolation is sad to me though that could be removed easily if a team had just taken him on again reliably and he had other peers to grind with or simply coexist with.</div>

<br />
Yes, that date is April Fool’s, but there’s no joke here. Well, there will be jokes. Lots of jokes. Jokes told by us, on television. But the fact that there WILL be jokes isn’t a joke, you see... Look, we’ll start over.<br />
<br />
 We are incredibly excited to announce that RiffTrax will take over the National Geographic Channel for a special night of riffs, badass dino birds, rage-filled shrimp, demon bats, and more!<br />
<br />
 The good folks at National Geographic have taught the world about animals, science, and fascinating cultures for years. Now, in their infinite wisdom, they’ve seen fit to have RiffTrax riffmasters Michael J. Nelson, Bill Corbett, and Kevin Murphy take on some of their wildest, strangest discoveries. This will be the guys’ first time riffing on television since Mystery Science Theater 3000, and trust us, you do NOT want to miss it. Think of them as the kids in the back of high school science class cracking wise, except funnier, and with better skin.<br />
<br />
 So flap your wings, flex your dorsal fin, or just move your regular old boring human feet, but do whatever you have to do to get yourself in front of a TV for the rapid-fire hilarity of TOTAL RIFF OFF on National Geographic!

WASHINGTON -- Justices on the Supreme Court seemed to struggle Tuesday with the question of whether a private company can get out of a federal law by citing the religious beliefs of its shareholders.<br />
<br />
Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., a Christian-owned crafts supply chain, and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp., owned by Mennonite Christians, are challenging the provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires for-profit companies to include all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives in their health insurance plans.<br />
<br />
Hobby Lobby's attorneys argue that the law violates the company's constitutional right to religious freedom by forcing it to cover all forms of birth control or pay steep fines. The company's owners are morally opposed to intrauterine devices and emergency contraception, believing it to be a form of abortion, though medical studies have debunked that claim.<br />
<br />
The contraception mandate does include exceptions for churches and a special accommodation for religiously affiliated nonprofits, such as schools and hospitals. But for-profit corporations are required to cover the full range of women's preventative care, including birth control, intrauterine devices and emergency contraception, at no cost to their female employees.<br />
<br />
At oral arguments on Tuesday, the women justices were the most aggressive in their questioning of Hobby Lobby's lawyer, former Solicitor General Paul D. Clement. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan asked whether other companies should be allowed to refuse to cover other procedures, like blood transfusions and vaccines, if employers had a religious objection to such medical treatments.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are quite a number of medical treatments that could be religiously objected to,&quot; Kagan stated. &quot;Everything would be piecemeal, nothing would be uniform.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kagan also suggested that corporations could challenge other federal laws, like minimum wage and family leave requirements and protections against child labor, based on their religious beliefs.<br />
<br />
But Clement said such a &quot;parade of horribles&quot; would not actually come before a court, and no company had challenged a minimum wage law, for example, based on religious considerations.<br />
<br />
Justice Anthony Kennedy, who many expect to be the swing vote in this case, questioned both sides aggressively. Kennedy asked Clement why the company couldn't just choose not to provide health insurance at all, pay a tax and then raise salaries to allow employees to purchase health care on their own. Assuming that would be a financial &quot;wash,&quot; Kennedy asked Clement, &quot;Then what would your case be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would we consider the rights of employees?&quot; Kennedy asked. &quot;The employees may not believe … in the religious beliefs of the employer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justice Antonin Scalia alternatively asked why the government couldn't simply pay for the &quot;three or four&quot; kinds of birth control that some religious employers consider to be &quot;abortifacients&quot; -- namely, the morning-after pill and intrauterine devices. &quot;That's not terribly expensive, is it?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
The administration's attorney, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., said federal and state laws &quot;don't consider these particular forms of contraception to be abortion.&quot; He said the government respected different beliefs on the subject, but noted that the some 2 million women who take those forms of birth control don't believe they are &quot;engaged in abortion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kennedy also questioned Verrilli as to why the Department of Health and Human Services had granted accommodations on the contraception coverage rule -- but not other parts of the Affordable Care Act -- to religiously affiliated nonprofits if the government had a compelling interest in providing birth control coverage to all women.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must have been because the health care coverage was not that important,&quot; Kennedy said.<br />
<br />
Some justices also asked whether for-profit corporations had the right to claim religious freedom exemptions to any federal laws.<br />
<br />
&quot;How does a corporation exercise religion?&quot; Sotomayor asked.<br />
<br />
Justice Samuel Alito proposed a hypothetical of whether a Jewish or Muslim butcher would be able to provide kosher or halal meats, if the butcher's shop was formed as a corporation and Congress outlawed such techniques as a form of animal cruelty.<br />
<br />
Verrilli said that in that case, individual customers would have standing to challenge the law, and the butcher might be able to step in in order to argue on their behalf.<br />
<br />
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it would have been &quot;strange&quot; for a large bipartisan part of Congress to pass a piece of legislation, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, if they believed it would allow for-profit companies to be exempt from federal laws because of the religious beliefs of their shareholders. She pointed out that an amendment along those lines was rejected by the Senate.<br />
<br />
If Hobby Lobby wins and the Supreme Court eventually rules that companies have a right to exercise religious freedom that exempts them from complying with federal law, the decision could have a far-reaching impact beyond women's health. For instance, such a ruling could open the door to more controversial laws like Arizona's recently debated &quot;religious freedom&quot; bill, which would allow businesses to refuse to serve LGBT people.<br />
<br />
As Kagan suggested Tuesday and as Verrilli wrote in a brief he filed on the case this month, the ruling also has the potential to get businesses out of having to comply with minimum wage and hiring discrimination laws, Social Security taxes and vaccination requirements.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allowing a corporation, through either shareholder vote or board resolution, to take on and assert the religious beliefs of its shareholders in order to avoid having to comply with a generally-applicable law with a secular purpose is fundamentally at odds with the entire concept of incorporation,&quot; Verrilli argued in the brief.<br />
<br />
Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius mark the first time the Supreme Court has taken up an issue related to the new federal health care law signed by President Barack Obama since the court upheld the law back in 2012. In that case, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the controlling opinion finding the individual mandate was constitutional as a tax.<br />
<br />
This time around, Kennedy potentially could return to his common role as the court's swing vote. Kennedy wrote the broad opinion in the Citizens United case, which found that the First Amendment prevented the government from limiting independent expenditures by corporations, but he's also been one of the court's strongest voices for gay rights, which could be negatively impacted if Hobby Lobby gets its way.<br />

<br />
Should be interesting to see how this plays out.  The whole idea of considering corporations as people seems absolutely LUDICROUS to me.  /sigh<br />

Oculus doesn't make a consumer product yet, but its headset called the Oculus Rift for video game developers has completely changed the way many feel about video games.<br />
<br />
The device is nearly impossible to describe. It makes you feel like you're truly immersed in a virtual environment. It's one of those things you have to try to fully understand. And we guarantee it'll blow your mind.<br />
<br />
Console gaming companies have sensed the threat of Oculus, which is why Sony announced a similar headset for its new PlayStation 4 gaming console. However, it's unclear when Sony's headset will launch.<br />
<br />
The question now is: why would Facebook buy a video game hardware company?<br />
<br />
<b>According to a statement from CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the company plans to expand Oculus beyond gaming:<br />
<br />
After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home.<br />
<br />
Zuckerberg expanded on that in a conference call following the announcement, saying he believes virtual reality will be the next big computing platform after mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.<br />
<br />
&quot;History suggests that there will be more platforms to come,&quot; Zuckerberg said on the conference call, adding that the person who controls that major computing platform will be able to shape the entire tech industry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today's acquisition is a long-term bet on the future of computing,&quot; Zuckerberg said.</b><br />
<br />
Oculus got its start on crowdfunding site Kickstarter, where it raised $2.4 million in 2012. Since then, other VCs have invested in the company. Most recently, Oculus raised $75 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Marc Andreessen, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a Facebook board member, tweeted today that he recused himself from acquisition talks between Facebook and Oculus VR.<br />
<br />
Last summer, Business Insider spoke with Oculus VR's 21-year-old founder Palmer Luckey about how he came up with the device. He got started at a young age, tinkering with all kinds of computerized headsets. You can read the full interview here.<br />
<br />
By the way, this isn't Facebook's only recent major acquisition. Just a few weeks ago, Facebook bought WhatsApp in a $19 billion deal.<br />
<br />
Here's Zuckerberg's full statement on the deal:<br />
<br />
I'm excited to announce that we've agreed to acquire Oculus VR, the leader in virtual reality technology.<br />
<br />
Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. For the past few years, this has mostly meant building mobile apps that help you share with the people you care about. We have a lot more to do on mobile, but at this point we feel we're in a position where we can start focusing on what platforms will come next to enable even more useful, entertaining and personal experiences.<br />
<br />
This is where Oculus comes in. They build virtual reality technology, like the Oculus Rift headset. When you put it on, you enter a completely immersive computer-generated environment, like a game or a movie scene or a place far away. The incredible thing about the technology is that you feel like you're actually present in another place with other people. People who try it say it's different from anything they've ever experienced in their lives.<br />
<br />
Oculus's mission is to enable you to experience the impossible. Their technology opens up the possibility of completely new kinds of experiences.<br />
<br />
<b>Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won't be changing and we hope to accelerate. The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there's a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform. We're going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games. Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this.</b><br />
<br />
But this is just the start. After games, we're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home.<br />
<br />
This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures.<br />
<br />
These are just some of the potential uses. By working with developers and partners across the industry, together we can build many more. One day, we believe this kind of immersive, augmented reality will become a part of daily life for billions of people.<br />
<br />
Virtual reality was once the dream of science fiction. But the internet was also once a dream, and so were computers and smartphones. The future is coming and we have a chance to build it together. I can't wait to start working with the whole team at Oculus to bring this future to the world, and to unlock new worlds for all of us.<br />
<br />
Here's the press release from Facebook:<br />
<br />
Facebook today announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR, Inc., the leader in immersive virtual reality technology, for a total of approximately $2 billion. This includes$400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock (valued at $1.6 billion based on the average closing price of the 20 trading days preceding March 21, 2014 of $69.35 per share).  The agreement also provides for an additional$300 million earn-out in cash and stock based on the achievement of certain milestones.<br />
<br />
Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company's virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas.  Given these broad potential applications, virtual reality technology is a strong candidate to emerge as the next social and communications platform.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mobile is the platform of today, and now we're also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,&quot; said Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. &quot;Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are excited to work with Mark and the Facebook team to deliver the very best virtual reality platform in the world,&quot; said Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus VR. &quot;We believe virtual reality will be heavily defined by social experiences that connect people in magical, new ways. It is a transformative and disruptive technology, that enables the world to experience the impossible, and it's only just the beginning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oculus will maintain its headquarters in Irvine, CA, and will continue development of the Oculus Rift, its ground-breaking virtual reality platform.<br />
<br />
The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2014.<br /></div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Am I doing it right? :p<br />
<br />
What a crazy acquisition. Should the people who kickstarted it be happy or annoyed? On the bright side, a ton of funding is sure to guarantee a product, and they claim they aren't going to cancel the gaming support focus that had existed before they bought the company. Just a week or so ago they announced that the version 2 prototype would be available for testing soon, but this might speed up the process. On the less than bright side, social media poking its nose into a nerdy niche before it even became a product most people could try.<br />
<br />
Someone find an appropriate cat picture!</div>

			The Internet Archive Wants To Digitize 40,000 VHS And Betamax Tapes<br />
<br />
By Sarah Kessler<br />
<br />
When Trevor von Stein first heard the story of a woman named Marion Stokes who spent decades recording television news, tape-by-tape, in her home, something resonated with him. &quot;I just sort of tingled,&quot; he says. &quot;I understood this woman a little bit.&quot; Von Stein also had something akin to a hoarding impulse, though most of what he kept--a large music library, his photos--was digital. And he believed in Stokes’s mission. “From one kindred spirit to another,&quot; he says, &quot;I thought we had to do it justice.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon after he learned about Stokes, von Stein became a volunteer at the Internet Archive, a nonprofit organization that plans to digitize and make public the 40,000 tapes Stokes left behind when she passed away in 2012.<br />
<br />
Von Stein has spent the last six weeks immersed in the first of those recordings: About 60 episodes of Input, a television show that Stokes (then Marion Metelits) co-produced between 1968 and 1971 for a local CBS Network affiliate. Those episodes are now on the Internet Archive website for anyone to download.<br />
<br />
Input looks nothing like the quick-cutting, drama-laden television of today. Each episode simply features a panel of people sitting in a half-circle formation. At the beginning of the show, there’s no introduction, just an abrupt entry into a conversation that has already begun. Topics tend to be grand in scope, things like “The Anatomy of Violence,” “Where Is This Thing Called Love?” and “Black Reparations.&quot; Panelists’ titles include everything from “Black Panther Party” to “Mother &amp; Divorcee.”<br />
<br />
Sometimes Input, which includes many long soliloquies and few edits, can be hard to follow. When von Stein showed the tapes to his dad, his father reasonably complained the people on the program were just talking heads.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, in this one small local show that was preserved through an amazing series of events--beginning with Marion Stokes's insistence on preservation and ending with her collection of tapes finding its way to the Internet Archive--a number of historically significant characters are featured.<br />
<br />
William C. Davidon, the man who helped expose the FBI’s spying on anti-war groups during the Vietnam War, appears in an episode called “Born Free?” John E. Fryer, the first psychiatrist to confront the American Psychiatric Association about its classification of homosexuality as a mental illness, appears in the episode “Puppet or Person?” Kurt Vonnegut’s son, Mark, appears in “The Nature of a Religious Life in a Secular Age.” And from every thriving movement of the '60s--whether it be civil rights, anti-war activism, women’s liberation, or something else--Input seems to have invited a prominent guest. This is one reason that von Stein finds the tapes fascinating. He’s made audio copies he can play in iTunes. “I am driving and listening to them,” he says. “I am taking a walk up Twin Peaks listening to them.”<br />
<br />
It’s not immediately obvious, however, exactly why it is useful to have this 45-year-old snapshot of intellectual discourse available online. Like many archivists, von Stein argues that’s not the point of preserving historical media. “I don’t know if it’s the Archive's or my job to figure out what good this will be for history in all of specificity,” he says. “I have no idea what could come of this research material. I just want to see it happen.”<br />
<br />
Getting to that point isn't easy. Making Input publicly available is only a very small first step toward completing the massive task the Internet Archive took on when it accepted Stokes’s collection. Across the bay from the organization's headquarters, in its Richmond, California, archive, there are still about 40,000 tapes to sort through (originally Stokes’s family thought there were 140,000, but they had over-estimated). In order to preserve the tapes, each one needs to be played back on a cassette reader. That takes time. And in addition to preserving the actual footage, humans must input meta-data that can help people explore the footage. Simply cataloging 537 VHS tapes on a spreadsheet for a sample inventory took an Internet Archive employee about 16 hours.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, many of the tapes, including Input episodes, are recorded on Betamax tapes, and the machines that can play them are nearing extinction. “There are a limited set of those available in the universe,” explains Roger Macdonald, the director of the Internet Archive’s Television arm. “So we’ve started trolling eBay and the like, keeping an eye out for them, starting to purchase them and looking for people who can repair them.”<br />
<br />
Macdonald estimates that digitizing the collection will cost more than $500,000, and most of that money still needs to be raised. For now, the Archive is relying mostly on volunteers like von Stein, who look at the pile of decades-old tapes and see not just talking heads, but an invaluable portal into the past.
