Dante used some of it in Purgatorio, Victor Hugo used it too. It's even in the Carmina Burana, but for the life of me, I can't find anyone who can translate this old carol for me:

You're probably right. And since it's borderline french/spanish and medieval no less, I don't think shampoo enters into the equation :P<br />
<br />
L'Occitane you say....hrm. I wonder if there's a relation to Aquitane in the linguistic history....</div></div><hr />

The bells are a ringing<br />
On Mid Winter's Night<br />
The moon sets all alone<br />
And once again I try to sleep before the morning light<br />
<br />
Too soon the sun will come a-calling over the hills in our little town<br />
Too soon the snow will start falling over the worls without a sound<br />
While in my room dreams are a-fleeting<br />
I close my eyes one more time<br />
All too quickly the dawn is breaking and I must leave the night behind.<br />
<br />
The bells are a ringing<br />
On Mid Winter's Night<br />
The moon sets all alone<br />
And once again I try to sleep before the morning light<br />
<br />
The bells are a ringing<br />
On Mid Winter's Night<br />
The moon sets all alone<br />
And once again I try to sleep before the morning light<br />
And once again I try to sleep before the morning light<br />
Before the morning light<br />
Before the morning light<br />

The above post isn't a translation -- it's a song that uses the same carol in it's beginning.<br />
<br />
Translating from occitan into french and then to english would be about as haphazard as typing &quot;I have to pee&quot; into a spanish-english translator and smacking translate back and forth a bunch of times. You'll end up with &quot;Necessito el baño&quot; which technically gets the point across but isn't correct at all.<br />
<br />
I was figuring since we had a bunch of scholarly types here, someone might have some knowledge. A shot in the dark, to be sure, but Graffë's is full of ethnic and cerebral diversity.<br />
<br />
edit -- I should add that I've been googling the fuck out of this for the last week, but all I turn up is more freaking Blackmore's Night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ein paar Zeilen hab ich, aber das bringt nicht so viel weiter:<br />
A questo nue, balin-balan,<br />

<br />
I don't speak German, but here's a quick translation of the French before I head off to my translation class:<br />
<br />
On that night, balin-balan<br />
They had sheep<br />
Whence come. . .<br />
The cat jumped into the basket<br />
And the guys in the hayloft<br />
Lurked like brigands<br />
<br />
Yeah, no idea what it means or why the first three lines make so little sense.</div></div><hr />

Mother{maire}, {lei}the (active) {camapgno} country [gansaion] -- is gansaion &quot;bells&quot; or &quot;ringing bells&quot;? campainha is portugese for &quot;bell&quot;.. I'm missing how this fits.<br />

<br />
I wrote it down on a piece of paper after a visit to help move a friend when I was in college and later used said piece of paper as a bookmark. I just happened to open said book about a week and a half ago and lo! what falls out?<br />
<br />
I originally found it in a book in the collection of one of my fellow ren fest workers circa 1999 while he was moving. We were all history nerds back then but he took the cake. He actually had a gut-strung lute and used to use his beautiful tenor to sing things like &quot;Je nus hons pris&quot;.</div></div><hr />
