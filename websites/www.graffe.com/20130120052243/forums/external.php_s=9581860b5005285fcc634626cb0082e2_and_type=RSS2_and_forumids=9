			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This isn't a rant, but I posted this in here due to the NSFW topic.  So, like most people with a dick, even when I'm in a relationship I like porn.  It's a great stress relief and it's not as though there is a ration on ejaculate.  In the past I was using some streaming sites, or when I wanted some 1080p content I would download it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, so in the interest of science I checked out the pricing of one of the streaming sites that has a bunch of the different networks bundled together for one price.  And, holy shit these prices are cheap.  For 1080p streams and the ability to download the scene in multiple formats at a high bitrate it was only 8 bucks a month.  <br />
<br />
It is by far the best 100 dollars I've spent (it was 8 dollars for 12 months of service), and I had no idea how inexpensive it was all this time.  I thought was like 20+ dollars for just one person's site, and here I can get 37 for 8 bucks.  The amount of videos is in the 6000+ range and it is well organized, which brings me to another point.<br />
<br />
Why are torrent and adult sites, the illegal/sinful sites, inevitably always much better designed than the legit, uber well funded megacorps?  The former sites always have a clean aesthetic, exceptional layout, excellent categories, and great search and other features, as well as some sort of comment/social feature.  It seems if anything it should be the other way around, but nope.  <br />
<br />
The megacorps sites are nearly always very cluttered and finding the actual content you want is nontrivial, they are basically the Wal-Mart grocery aisle layouts for the Internet.  The are designed to take as long as possible to get to where you want to go to so that you see more of their content I am guessing.<br />
<br />
One especially egregious example of this is how much of a clusterfuck the iTunes store is. Sure, it's pretty, but using their advanced searches is a total pain in the dick, and just navigating the site is really slow and inefficient.  Another example is Yahoo's site.  There is 100 different content categories and distracting as hell.  I think it was designed by artists on LSD while coding it up as that is about the only way someone would consider the facial imagery explosion delivered in category vomit format is reasonable.<br />
<br />
Google's websites are for the most part an exception to this trend.  Google+ however has gotten worse and worse over time in its layout, with much of the content being very poorly sized, making original content hard to view compared to a better layout that is more like their minimalistic designs of their email and search features.<br />
<br />
Another example is 4Chan's website (don't go here, it is awful, but if you had the unfortunate experience of going there the layout should be fresh).  Even though their was a ton of image content it was always the focus of the page, not something in a jungle of ads and other crap.<br />
<br />
The Verge is another capitalistic site that has a good layout.  It is very modern while still presenting the information that is important to the user with minimal unrelated content.  Also, I think Amazon and New Egg have good site designs, both of which have a ton of different kinds of information to display.  <br />
<br />
And that is what grinds my gears.</div>

			<title>Abandonment of Superior Systems by Previous Generations in Culture</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I increasingly encounter systems and tools that are significantly superior to the commonly used tools or systems yet despite this impression they have been set aside in favor of worse solutions.  I am curious as to why these developments happened.  Hopefully those of you who are older have some insight to why society moved away from such habits.<br />
<br />
Curious Encounters:<br />
<br />
1) Shaving Habits by Men and Women<br />
I used razors and the associated blades like the Mach 3 and later iterations by Gillette as that is simply how things were commonly done.  They are a reasonable solution to the problem of hair removal.  However, I was persuaded by arguments for the previous common solutions for hair removal in the form of safety razors, the common tool for such feats before the multiblade razors produced by Gillette et al. were the standard tool for achieving results.  <br />
<br />
In the interest of science I experimented with the safety razor design and kit apprehensively.  Surprisingly, despite my ignorance in the matter going into it and only having read some short information on how to use the safety razor for shaving, it was trivial to get a quality shave with it, removing my expectation that such tools were difficult to use competently and thus a motivation for the common razors used today.  The initial cost is reasonable and not that much more than buying a razor and blades that will be shortly replaced yet the marginal costs of using safety razors versus the mach 3 etc. is absurdly in favor of the safety razor and the safety razor has better results IME.<br />
<br />
So, with older generations being deft at using safety razors before today's razors replaced the usage of safety razors why were older generations motivated to make that switch?  I can't find an angle where the change in tools is compelling and the change in cultural behavior is reasonable.  Also, safety razors (or even just men's razors like the mach3 etc.) are allegedly better shaves than those marketed specifically to women.  I can see why a company would market directly to a demographic but why then sell an inferior product to that segment when economies of scale don't favor such pivoting.<br />
<br />
2)  Being born in an era where WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) tools like Microsoft Word or Open Office or Lotus Notes etc. are the go to solution for writing documents and papers is just the way things are done that is what I used for writing papers.  Aggravated by the poor formatting of Word's equations and how slow utilizing the equation editor is, I looked towards other solutions that would increase my efficiency in developing the documents but also have a more crisp representation of the equations and symbols.  The common alternative or preference to Word for STEM papers is a TeX implementation, usually LaTeX.  I tried that out first, hoping to achieve better results and experience than what I was having in Word.  <br />
<br />
Surprisingly (at least with the environment achieved with Auctex + Emacs + Tex Live or something similar) the new tool chain was much faster to develop documents in but also did not have a big time investment to change to.  The result is very aesthetically pleasing and there are other technical advantages too over what was historical implementations of the Word processor and doc format.  Tex is simply a plain text file instead of being a proprietary binary format (like earlier versions of doc) and future versions of said format promoting vendor lock in and breaking accessibility to documents in the latest format iteration for those not using the latest version of Word.  The document is easily versioned and can be exported in many formats with ease.  I now use tex for all documents and equation heavy notes simply because it seems better in every way and has synergy with other work flows.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the point isn't to berate Word or Office, which is quite nice in most aspects, but to answer the question of why did computer users abandon tex in favor of WYSIWYG editors when (at least now, previews of the tex document are available) accessing all the symbols and equation formatting is very accessible, faster in development, more compatible for the purpose of sharing documents with others, and has a prettier result.  One argument I made with myself as to why people were encouraged to abandon tex for WYSIWYG editors, in particular word, is that the tool was simply there alongside the exceptionally useful spreadsheet tool, which even today is a tool in the back pocket of many and suitable for many tasks.  <br />
<br />
3) Abandonment of Health as an Area of Concern<br />
I realize why people are increasingly unhealthy in some industrialized countries with regard to their own weight, and I intend no offense to anyone and I also realize that for some people significant weight gain is difficult to avoid due to medical conditions.  I'm excluding the latter in the discussion because that is a small percent of the overall population who have such conditions and lacking explanatory power for the significant portion of society that is trending towards or is morbidly obese already.  I merely find the build up of this shift in aesthetic curious.  If we look back towards younger generations, people were much more fit, and what is referred to as morbidly obese today was exceptionally rare to see in society.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to today, portions have increased and for environmental reasons exercise that occurs merely as a side effect of working has decreased such that the day over day trend is weight gain for most people.  Flash back to 50 years ago, the working environment and cultural values change, significant exercise is no longer common to experience while working and it takes an active pursuit of maintaining health in order to avoid trending towards no longer being healthy.  <br />
<br />
However, drastic weight change from being a fit individual to morbidly obese is achieved over a significant period of time, meaning that the day over day change in appearance is slow.  People in the culture seeing their peers or people around them trend towards increasing thickness would seemingly have raised concern for why people around them are becoming thicker when that was not the case.  As a result, people realizing the ill effect and possibly unavoidably so seemingly would take action to reverse that trend and return towards the previously fit culture as merely being the way things are.  Observing the typical person in the US it is seen that previous generations did not adjust their behaviors to reverse the trend toward morbid obesity being common in society. Why?  Why did society stop caring that their health and appeal to potential mates was worsening?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hulu Plus is kind of terrible.  Yeah, it's better than watching the movie or TV show on live TV, but it's not competing against live TV.  It's competing against piracy.  Making commercials required as part of the experience is awful.  It would be okay if Hulu Plus had an option that was more expensive and did not include commercials that would be fine, but that option does not exist.  Instead not only are you forced to watch commercials but the entire episode list for shows are not always there.  Sure, they are short commercials but they completely interrupt the viewing experience.  It is jarring and erases whatever emersion previously existed.</div>

So many firsts for me occurred in that game, and while some future mmo may be technically better, I won't find one that is as compelling.  My first kiting experience was in EQ, the world was punishing (even on a PVE server), and I even saw my first dragon and giant in that game.  Bartering in EQ was even cool due to everything being face to face.</div>
