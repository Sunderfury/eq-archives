So, I found a Senior Network Engineer job, that seems to match well to my skill set.  My main weakness is in my lack of a degree.  Here's hoping my 15 years experience counts lots.<br />

         Mike Swainger lost an arm and one leg after he was hit by a train when he was 13 years old.<br />

         Twenty years on and he says he has been given a new chance to enjoy life with his battery powered hand.<br /></div>

</div>The geek in me would be interested to see what kind of not-hand devices could be brought in to use. I'm most impressed about the fine motor  control displayed, although I expect  there is a lot of blocks built in to the unit &amp; software to  prevent accidental (or deliberate) crushing, <br />
<br />

I do wonder how this kind of treatment would play out in the US or whether it would be possible for anyone without deep pockets.</div>

			STORY HIGHLIGHTS<br />
 <ul><li style=""><b>NEW: Two groups say they're filing lawsuits challenging the newly signed California law</li><li style="">NEW: A &quot;reparative therapist&quot; calls the law &quot;the height of ... irresponsibility&quot;</b></li><li style="">The law will prohibit sexual orientation change therapy for children under age 18</li><li style="">A psychiatric group says the therapy can bring on depression and self-destructive behavior </li></ul><br />
<br />
(CNN) -- Therapy aimed at turning gay kids straight will soon be illegal in California, with the state's governor declaring he hopes a new law will relegate such efforts &quot;to the dustbin of quackery.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The legislation -- which the state Senate passed in May, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law this weekend and will take effect January 1 -- prohibits attempts to change the sexual orientation of patients under age 18.<br />
 <br />
&quot;This bill bans non-scientific 'therapies' that have driven young people to depression and suicide,&quot; Brown tweeted. &quot;These practices have no basis in science or medicine.&quot;<br />
 <br />
But practitioners of so-called &quot;reparative therapy&quot; say the assertions of the governor and gay rights advocates &quot;just are not true,&quot; according to David Pickup, a spokesman for the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality.<br />
 <br />
Joined by &quot;individual therapists and individual minor clients,&quot; his group will file a &quot;major lawsuit&quot; this week to challenge the law,&quot; Pickup said. The Pacific Justice Institute separately told CNN it will file its own lawsuit Monday, alleging the law violates the First Amendment.<br />
 <br />
&quot;We do competent therapy, therapy that truly works,&quot; Pickup, who himself underwent such therapy and now administers it to others, said Monday on CNN.<br />
 <br />
&quot;For them to have a bill that says, 'No, we can't even talk about these issues, we can't do anything to help these children resolve their homosexual feelings and maximize their heterosexual potential' -- that's the height of political and therapeutic irresponsibility.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Pickup alluded to a report by the American Psychiatric Association that, he says, doesn't find any &quot;proof that (the therapy) causes harm.&quot;<br />
 <br />
But the psychiatric organization -- which is the world's largest of its kind, with more than 36,000 members -- determined, in fact, that reparative therapy poses a great risk, including increasing the likelihood or severity of depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior for those undergoing therapy. Therapists' alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already felt by patients, the association says.<br />
<br />
&quot;The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality per se is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation,&quot; the association says.<br />
 <br />
After the bill passed the state Senate, Equality California spokeswoman Rebekah Orr praised the &quot;right first step in making sure that young people are protected from these unscrupulous therapists who are really engaging in therapeutic deception that is based on junk science.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;This law will ensure that state-licensed therapists can no longer abuse their power to harm LGBT youth and propagate the dangerous and deadly lie that sexual orientation is an illness or disorder that can be 'cured,'&quot; said Orr's organization, which describes itself as the largest statewide advocacy group in California working for &quot;full equality&quot; for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people.<br />
 <br />
Peter Drake, who once participated in reparative therapy, said the bill protects youths from &quot;a very, very dangerous therapy that doesn't work and leaves a lot of people feeling despair and hopelessness.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Yet Pickup insists that the &quot;children who walk into my office ... crying, depressed, lonely, gender-identity confused and sexually confused&quot; ask for help voluntarily, because they are &quot;distressed.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Thousands believe, he claims, &quot;believe there's a cause-and-effect nature of homosexuality&quot; that can be brought about by instances of abuse and issues like &quot;gender identity inferiority,&quot; &quot;un-met needs from ... usually the same-sex parent&quot; and other &quot;inner wounds that we discover in therapy.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;When those wounds get healed, the homosexual feelings -- we don't force them away, they naturally, spontaneously dissipate,&quot; said Pickup, who credits the therapy with having &quot;helped save my life,&quot; by decreasing his depression and raising his self-esteem.<br />
 <br />
The debate could now move to court, thanks to promised lawsuits by Pickup's group and the Pacific Justice Institute that describes itself as a network of more than 1,000 attorneys &quot;defending religious, parental, and other constitutional rights.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Of all the freedom-killing bills we have seen in our legislature the last several years, this is among the worst,&quot; said Brad Dacus, the institute's president and founder, in a written statement.<br />
<br />
The legal battle could center around the questions of whether such therapy constitutes child abuse and if a ban is unconstitutional.<br />
<br />
Ryan Kendall, who went through this type of therapy when he was 13, told CNN it began after his mother read his diary and discovered he was gay. In the therapy, he was consistently told his sexuality was a choice and could &quot;be fixed,&quot; he said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I never believed that. I know I'm gay just like I know I'm short and I'm half Hispanic. I've never thought that those facts would change. It's part of my core fundamental identity. So the parallel would be sending me to tall camp and saying, 'If you try very hard, one day you can be 6-foot-1.'&quot;<br />
 <br />
Kendall said psychologist Joseph Nicolosi treated him. His parents provided CNN with copies of bills from Nicolosi's office, but Nicolosi said he did not remember treating someone by that name.<br />
 <br />
He told CNN he views the therapy he provides as &quot;trying to bring out the heterosexuality&quot; in someone.<br />
 <br />
Yet Nicolosi insisted the therapy is not harmful, and he treats only people who want to change.<br />
 <br />
A leading psychologist in the field of reparative therapy, George Rekers, treated a boy named Kirk Murphy, whose story was told in a 2011 CNN report. Rekers considered Kirk a success story, writing that &quot;his feminine behavior was gone&quot; -- proof, Rekers said, that homosexuality can be prevented.<br />
 <br />
But Murphy's family said he never stopped being gay. He hanged himself at the age of 38. Despite allegations by the family that Rekers' therapy decades earlier ultimately led to the suicide , Rekers told CNN that scientifically, it &quot;would be inaccurate to assume that it was the therapy,&quot; and that he grieves for the parents.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Two independent psychologists with me had evaluated him and said he was better adjusted after treatment,&quot; Rekers said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I only meant to help, do the best I could with the parents,&quot; he added.<br />
 <br />
Rekers' days as a prominent anti-gay champion came to an end after he hired a male escort to accompany him on a trip to Europe. He denied any sexual contact or awareness at the time that the escort offered sexual favors.<br />
 <br />
Earlier this year, psychiatrist Robert L. Spitzer apologized for his 2003 study of reparative therapy, which suggested that it could help gays and lesbians become straight. He said it was deeply flawed.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy,&quot; Spitzer said in a letter to the editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior. &quot;I also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works with some 'highly motivated' individuals.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Kendall said the therapy he underwent &quot;led me to periods of homelessness, to drug abuse, to spending a decade of my life wanting to kill myself. It led to so much pain and struggle. And I want them to know that what they do hurts people.<br />
 <br />
&quot;It hurts children. It has no basis in fact. And they need to stop.&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I work until 1-2 AM at a crummy job to provide the single income that supports my family.  My wife has serious health problems and I asked her a few years back to stop working as her health was suffering. About once a week I walk about 6 miles home from work.  The hour is certainly odd but I don't live in an area where I fear for my safety and its healthy and clears my head. <br />
<br />
Regularly the local police harass me for no particular reason.  I have no record of any kind.  As in not even a ticket...ever.  I do not look like a gangster or a criminal.   <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=1888&amp;d=1348928576"  title="Name:  michaelnov2011web.jpg

I have been threatened, I have been disrespected, I have been asked to show a baggy in my pocket because all the hip drug dealers keep their stash in jack links teriyaki bags because that tangy flavor smokes so damn smooth.  I have been told they were concerned for my safety because I didn't have a coat. I have been questioned repeatedly, patted down with my hands on the freaking car, had my nonexistent record run repeatedly at their convenience.   I have been threatened with arrest not once but twice while helping someone more their property from their apartment.  Once made to wait an hour because they wanted to verify that the resident who had committed the grievous sin of being born with dark skin wasn't robbing the place despite his id showing residence and his mail being in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
As I was leaving the latest shakedown I used the f word while turning to walk away.  I was subsequently arrested for public disorderly conduct based entirely on the content of my speech.  It is illegal in the state of South Carolina to use profanity on the public road.   Yes really.  The officer assured me it was the content of my speech which was illegal.  Further that &quot;The first amendment doesn't mean you can say whatever you want.&quot;  Her further cited the fact that an employer can fire you for making racist statements as an example that free speech doesn't guarantee well free speech.  The distinction between a private employment agreement and the law of the land was entirely lost on him unfortunately because apparently we don't teach that in the south.<br />
<br />
So I was kidnapped and tossed in with a bunch of drug addicts and drunks including one fellow who got arrested for being drunk in his own back yard and hadn't been able to reach anyone on the phone for 3 days.  He spent the entire time crumpling his paperwork and smoothing it out.  Not the most exciting social environment there.<br />
<br />
I was unable to contact anyone for like 8 hours.  I told the cops there that I needed to call my wife because if I disappeared in the middle of the night she would think I was dead.  I got... laughter.  Then one of the dicks came over and I thought he was going to give me my phone call unfortunately he had just realized by watching me waving that he had forgotten to confiscate my wedding ring... Gee thanks asshole.  Not only this but when my wife started calling ERs and police stations she was lied to and told I wasn't there.<br />
<br />
When I got out of web cam court, yes really, I was given my cell phone and could finally reach her.  She had spent the entire morning crying thinking I was dead.<br />
<br />
Now I have to deal with a court case in which I face a $270 fine that I can pay but would really like to put towards something like a FUCKING bill and a threat of prosecuting me for having in my possession a entirely legal prescription drug based on the fact that I chose to carry a single pill in a key chain container from a local pharmacy rather than strolling around with the entire bottle.<br />
<br />
I fucking love living in the land of the free and the home of the brave.  Is fucking cursing on the fucking internet fucking illegal yet?</div>
