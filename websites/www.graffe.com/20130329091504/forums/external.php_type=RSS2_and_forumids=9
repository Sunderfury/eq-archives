Thread after thread after thread bashing on changes in technology that have proven time and time again to save time, increase productivity, and reduce confusion, but you guys are all &quot;OH MY GOD SOMETHING CHANGED AND I'M OLD I CAN'T USE MY BRAIN IN MORE TO LEARN NEW THINGS BECAUSE I'M OLD&quot;<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Now granted, it's been about 10 years since I've written any C++.  Still, the language is easy enough to pick back up.  But why the fuck does Visual Studio have to make adding extra libraries to a project so damn complicated?  If I wasn't stuck using Windows for this damn project I'd ditch it in a heartbeat.  But since the project is kinda dependent on fucking Windows, I'm stuck using VS.  Fuck you Microsoft.  Guess I'll just spend the next week trying to get a handle on your fucking overly complicated IDE instead of doing anything useful.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Like my everquest suspicions, I'm truly beginning to wonder if there's an &quot;alpha&quot; and a &quot;beta&quot; team.<br />
<br />
I ran windows 2000 on my home computer from shortly after mass OEM vendor release until late 2007.<br />
<br />
The reason I ran it for that long was that MS kept OBFUSCATING THE FUCK OUT OF EVERY OPTION THEY COULD FIND AND CAUSING ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS TO END USERS.<br />
<br />
Case in point: early windows xp firewall. Suddenly users couldn't connect to ANYTHING they needed to even though there were firewall exceptions. That's beyond a bug, that was purposeful development. So much so, in fact, that in order to get two-way communication to work, they had to leave several ports open just to allow their software to function:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/windows-icf-cant-live-it-cant-live-without-it" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.symantec.com/connect/arti...ive-without-it</a><br />
<br />
<br />
I finally installed xp on a machine sometime after sp1a. (After that whole &quot;OOOPS! WE FUCKED UP WITH OEM DISCS! SORRY ABOUT THAT ACTIVATION CODE THING BUT WE&quot;RE WORRIED ABOUT PIRACY!!!! p.s. we hate end users because they're not our major source of revenue)<br />
<br />
So I happily lived in xp for a good long time.<br />
It took a little bit of work to clean up the bloat (and I'm not talking about vendor bloat, just these supposedly beautiful new ms &quot;features&quot; that could slow down a single core 2.1ghz box with 2.5gb of ram without even scratching it's own itch if you didn't turn them off first and optimize for &quot;best performance&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sure, someone re-organized the control panel, but xp was pretty good. Once they got to SP2 it was nice and stable and you actually could gain control over almost everything.<br />
<br />
Enter vista, which I avoided more successfully than my two week stint with windows ME by figuring out the &quot;alternate dev team&quot; bullshit that was SO prevalent in all software development times right around when microsoft switched from nt4 final to server 2000. (disclaimer - serverwise I've never managed anything earlier than NT4)<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>sbs</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
Enter the SBS line.<br />
<br />
Small business server.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows anything about administering servers you can throw it out the fucking window right now when it comes to sbs.<br />
<br />
Why, you ask? <br />
<br />
Because you can't do simple things like use &quot;active directory users and computers&quot; to create a user on an sbs server without breaking the entire fucking structure.<br />
<br />
Sure, you can import into the sbs wizard from AD, but you HAVE TO CREATE A USER ~*FIRST*~ IN THE MOTHERFUCKING SBS PANEL ---BEFORE you can alter a single goddamned detail of a user's profile. <br />
<br />
You can't add them into any groups, you can't remove them from any, they get DEFAULT SBS GROUPS. PERIOD.<br />
<br />
If you don't do that FIRST, you risk a lot of work.<br />
<br />
You can alter things afterwards and change what groups they are in via the skittlestick-like invocation of the now-magically-available dsa.msc, but if you try that first?<br />
<br />
There is potential to fuck up the entirety of a user's access or even the entire domain, since an sbs server MUST be the pdc AND THEY WROTE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT INTERFACE FOR THIS PURPOSE. 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
Now I get server 2012.<br />
<br />
It involves extra steps for EVERYTHING when I remote into it.<br />
<br />
Like windows 8, there is no start menu.<br />
<br />
Unlike windows 8,there is no &quot;get me the fuck out of here and show me anything normal&quot; key combination.<br />
<br />
Good luck launching a fucking command prompt unless you want to navigate to tools, launch powershell, and type <i>cmd</i> so you can start navigating directories or issuing commands.<br />
<br />
EVERYTHING you want to do requires you to scroll through THEIR completely shitty UI in server 2012.<br />
<br />
Now, instead of the 3 year cycle (roughly) that has happened for windows releases, what is MS doing?<br />
<br />
THEY'RE PUSHING A ONE YEAR CYCLE.<br />
<br />
Don't bother buying windows blue, the betas are due out this fucking summer and there will be only ONE release candidate.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's not a patch for windows 8, that's windows NINE.<br />
<br />
Between this bullshit development cycle and the outages that are becoming all-too-regular on their touted products such as azure and office365 (and the slowdown on 365 last night, thanks for those server updates you FUCKING MORONIC COCK-MANGLING LACKWITS, I SURE AS FUCK HAD NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN TELL A CLIENT TO WAIT 2 HOURS FOR A 638 MB OFFICE DOWNLOAD FROM YOUR SERVERS ON A GUARANTEED LEASED 3Mb/SEC DOWN-PIPE!!! WAY TO RUN A ROLL OUT FOR JUST INTERFACE UPGRADES YOU INCOMPETENT, MISMANAGED, SCALE-IGNORANT, FEEBLEMINDS!)  I'm really getting pissed off at Microsoft assuming that every other one of their business customers needs to be either thought for (WHEN MOST OF THE GODDAMNED PEOPLE THEY SEND TO CLIENT SITES ARE CERTIFIED TO HELL AND BACK BUT CAN'T DEBUG OR TROUBLESHOOT A DAMNED THING IN THEIR OWN CODE IF VS ISN'T THROWING AN ERROR) or just forced to &quot;adopt&quot; broken undeveloped shitty software because the rest of it is being &quot;twilighted&quot; or &quot;sunsetted&quot; or whatever fucking terminology they've mixed up as heavily as the new menu system these days.<br />
<br />
Way to be like every other piece of shitty, poorly coded piece of enterprise software out there, microsoft.<br />
<br />
Get your fucking act together.<br />
<br />
You had serious potential and still dominate the market.<br />
<br />
Start excelling by adding features instead of substituting glam.<br />
