		<div>....and I just couldn't put my finger on it. I don't hate the game, but as friends in game seem to concur, it is missing something that EQ had. At first I chalked it up to the genre losing steam in and of itself. But upon reflection, I think it may be the way the game is structured.<br />
<br />
It is almost too babied. I mean locking MOBs. I can see the usefulness and why it was implemented based on griefing, training and KSing in EQ 1, but it almost feels too contrived, gamey. That's really not <u>real</u>. That kills some of the magic for me. Well it's quite obvious I'm not fully emersed in this fantasy world when I can't go do anything I'd like.<br />
<br />
Even instanced zones… once again I can see the usefulness, especially with the two city start point that creates blocks, but I think something was taken away by making everything instanced raids. It’s like the MOBs no longer have souls, they are no longer individuals, or prized trophies that only spawn every so often if you will. Now two people can get the same loot off the same named MOB at the same time. You can no longer walk out of a Vox raid and say to yourself, I am the noly one who will have this spear for 5 days on the whole damn server. This for some reason takes away from a big part of the game for me and most others that focuses on your individual achievements.<br />
<br />
Harvesting tradeskill items.. once again the items just randomly appearing in the desert. Oh look, there is a rock outcropping next to a shrubbery and some roots. It’s like the EQ Gods are sprinkling skittles for us to harvest. Doesn’t feel quite right.<br />
<br />
Don't get me  wrong. Again, I don't hate this game, but I think it is missing some of the magic that EQ 1 had.  Discuss...</div>

Personally i love locked encounters, love instanced zones and love the foraging system (which is the same as ground spawns in eq anyweay, just taken a step further.) but i can see why people would not like them.<br />

While I can understand the contrived feeling, I do agree with the implementation of locked encounters.  In the big picture it allows the Dev's to balance content much easier.  Without locked encounters, we'll be back to powerlevelling, zerging, KSing, Training...these are NOT good things for any game and while EQ2 may have been a hardline solution it most certainly removes these bad elements and while it may be nice exploiting the non locked mob loopholes in EQ1, it's just not fun in the long run.<br />
<br />
I love the fact that you can't single pull groups of mobs anymore and if 8 are linked, you have to fight 8 all at once...it's SO much more fun than waiting for the monk to split, doing one at a time and then breaking the spawn so you can do 1 at a time all night.  Do you remember how boring that was?  It led to sony having to design content with the knowledge that every mob is going to be single pulled, so they do insane DPS, so you get mobs in Plane of Fire hitting harder than half the end game bosses of the expansion a year earlier. <br />

I agree with the instanced thing but it's a necessary evil.  Fighting over spawns having to race other guilds to content was not healthy for the game.  Instances in EQ2 are much less anyway so I think this issue isn't as bad as it's made out to be.  Much content is dynamically instanced so there is still competition for many things yet controlled enough to not have nothing to do.  If everything was instanced everywhere all the time It would suck too.  LDoN was a major turnoff for me this way.  Worst expansion EVER (to me anyway).<br />

I dunno I like this too...foraging in EQ1 certainly wasn't any better and only a select few classes could use. Neither was getting rare drops from mobs all the time...call me crazy but I think it makes way more sense to harvest resources instead of raw ore dropping from a mob's corpse...</div>

Can you honestly say that you would rather get splattered by the rediculous number of trains in this game for the sake of realism?  No thanks.  I prefer being able to play.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I believe the all elusive 'magic' that people are searching for is reserved for special first time experiences.<br />
<br />
This is not the first time you've played a game online.  Try talking to someone who is playing EQ2 that doesn't have any previous experience to compare it to.  What they're experiencing is the magic you and I had when we first started exploring.  EQ lost that first time magic after a few months, gameplay and friendship is what kept me in it for 3 years.  In that sense, EQ2 isn't going to be all 'new,' persay.  It's gameplay and friendship once again that will make it worth playing.</div>

How high of level were you trying to go from the Commonlands to Antonica?  Being in Nek at level 17 was like being back in Kithicor woods at night, scary and unnerving, but exhiliarating.<br />
<br />
Have you been to the depths of Stormhold and have you tried to complete any of the quests that lead you there at a resonable level?  Saying there's no danger in this game is asenine.  There's as much as you can handle.  The unfortunate thing is most people don't have a group of people willing to go find it.<br />
<br />
If you classify some jackass who can't control his mobs running me over as danger, then I'm glad I'm not in the game you're looking for.</div>

		<div>The Kith run was a heck of a lot harder than the Antonica/Commonlands run in EQ2.  In EQ2 I did this run at level 17 without a guide and only using the in game map.  Agro radius in EQ2 is insanely small.  I only got agro on this run once (one of the bats) and outran him.<br />
<br />
As far as I know I have been in the depths of stormhold, I am TOV keyed (perhaps I am missing something?).  We have only done TOV itself once but the final guy wouldn't spawn, not sure what we were doing wrong.  Haven't been back since.<br />

In EQ1 there were roamers that would on occasion add that kept things exciting.  Most outside zones had high level mobs that you had to watch out for (that would roam).  These kept thinks exciting.  In EQ2 the high level outside mobs stay put (or stay within a very defined range).<br />
<br />
I have afked for an hour and a half at the runneye zone in without being killed. This strikes me as wrong, perhaps I expect a dungeon that is orange con + to be a little more dangerous :)<br />
<br />
I am currently only level 31, so pretty much a newbie in my estimation.  Perhaps things change as you get to the higher levels, I can't really speak to that.  I do hope that is the case though.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest reason I have this point of view is I don't do pickup groups.  Grouping with morons can make anything difficult :)  I group with guildies and our normal guild group does feature two healers (cleric/fury) but that it wasn't planned that way.  We started the game without any prior knowledge.  But if adding another healer trivializes the content so much that it gives me this impression, perhaps they need to adjust that.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, don't get me wrong.  The game is fun and I play it every evening (barjam on the crushbone server).</div>

<br />
For this reason I firmly believe that EQ2 is a new step in an evolutionarly process.  EQ2 cannot make me feel the way that EQ1 did.  But it can provide many more hours of entertainment, and be an enjoying experience in an entirely new, somewhat familiar but yet different way.<br />

				<div style="font-style:italic">That's what I ment.  You can't enter any massive online world anymore with the same amount of awe that you have that first time.  We now expect those worlds to be massive, dynamic, and challenging.  The trick is accepting the challenges each world presents for us and not destract ourselves with comparisons to how things are in another online world. :)<br />

well I just quit EQ2 for WoW and I got this feeling again when I took the tram to Ironforge and ran outside the city. The snow cover pine forest in the Mountains is amazing.</div>

		<div>I played D&amp;D for 15+ years, the first time I saw it in a 3D world I was just amazed, I doubt that feeling will ever be back.<br />
<br />
One major flaw is that EQ2 is not made for the current hardware, I have a decent pc, not the top of the line, but if I go into high details I lose playability, but jeez, the game becomes truly amazing then.<br />
Oh well, sooner or later I'll play with all high settings, shadows and stuff, now I do it for browsing safe zones, and imo is well worth trying if you never did.<br />
<br />
Immersion killer number 1 is instancing multiple copies of the same zone (with the bugs associated t it) and the huge amount of zoning you do, I'd love to see a seamless EQ, guess I'll have to wait for Vanguard for that.<br />
I can't speak for WoW as I never played it, but that cartoonish graphic alone is an immersion killer for me, maybe I'll give it a try.</div>
