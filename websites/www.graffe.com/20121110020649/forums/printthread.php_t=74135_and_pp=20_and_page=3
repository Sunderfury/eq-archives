</div>Oh, that sucks. <br />
That's one of my most-used features on google maps from my work PC (which is on the opposite side of town from where I live so I have absolutely no idea where anything is).<br />
<br />
Despite being mostly anti-windows for anything but games and my mp3 player (the zune HD ui and software is really amazingly great at being both simple to use, stable, and powerful.) I would actually seriously consider a windows phone if they could marshal themselves for long enough to compete on the app level.<br />
The original zune was crap and windows mobile 5 was ungodly horrible, but winmo 6 was fairly slick and the zuneHD is quite good. <br />
<br />
If windows phone 7 took any of that UI decency and applied it properly, it'd be a nice refreshing change.<br />
<br />
Sadly, a lot of the proprietary apps I would like to use for work purposes are only just making it to the android arena after porting to the iPhone (Kaseya/Connectwise/Bomgar/Sonicwall VPN) and aren't quite fully functional in all cases yet despite Android's existing longevity, so I don't really think vendors are going to line up to pay developers for an even smaller market of windows phones.<br />
<br />
It's sad, because the windows mobile UI team seems to do really well.</blockquote>

</div>Given that Microsoft is, to some extent, trying to meld the phone OS with the PC system, porting apps to Win 8 might not be that hard -- if only Google would do so for its own apps. I suppose that would be self-defeating for the goal of trying to drive Android adoption, but really, who cares where people are using their revenue engine (i.e., search stuff) as long as it's being used?</blockquote>

</div>Probably because this thread started with a comparison of Android versus non-Android? Those sorts of discussions usually lead to discussions of pros <b>AND</b> cons. Besides, we're talking gadgets, not human beings; I'm pretty sure there won't be an uprising of iPhones if people make fun of their crappy maps.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I will say that iOS 6 is the first update that I've felt was bad.  There are a number of aesthetic choices that I find extremely irritating and that affect me as part of my daily routine.  The walled garden is great as long as the benevolent dictator is making good decisions that align with your own needs/wants, but when that is no longer true the inability to customize it yourself becomes an issue.  For example, the UI's title bar changes colors depending on what app you are in for no apparent reason.  On the iPad the horizontal scroll bar shows up in the middle of the screen, exactly where your line of sight is, thereby covering up actual content.  I am currently looking into technology that will resurrect Steve Jobs. <br />
<br />
Another thing, data is absurdly expensive for mobileme etc, and you cannot actually purchase a usable amount at any cost, that plan simply does not exist.  Contrast that with Google's offerings, and there plans are pretty inexpensive and integrated with other great services.  I feel like Google's their own worst enemy though by not making a cohesive interface that is the default instead of having companies like Samsung put their own apps on their phones.  Also, the marketing is generally very poor, pushing terms on people that they have no ability to understand in general, and out of the group which can understand them the comparisons are disingenuous. The latest (I think) Samsung commercial is good though for the most part.  Google's commercials for their services is best though.</blockquote>

The buttons / bars / everything just looks dated at this point.  Functionality doesn't have to change, but it needs a graphics refresh to remain 'cool'.  Honestly I would have thought apple to be much more on the ball in this area.  Even windows changes their look more often than Apple does.  They are very much in 'milk the product' mode and not so much in the 'revolutionize the industry' mode.<br />
<br />
Edit: some of those map criticisms are just nitpicking.  Sure, we all want addresses that are accurate to within 10 feet. But it's not a realistic expectation on a new product.  Or is it any surprise that roads under bridges are not rendered in a 3d model?  No, it really isn't.  It's a sucky product for plenty of reasons.  There's no need to make up more.</blockquote>

I do not like how UI cohesion has decreased instead of increased as the iOS iterations have occurred.  For example, one of the interface paradigms in iOS is that you can put any app inside a folder.  You cannot do that with News Stand.  Arguably News Stand is its own folder and it follows the paradigm of not putting a folder inside another folder, however to the majority of users that is not apparent and even if it is, allowing people to put News Stand into another folder should be allowed regardless.<br />

There are a number of things that are not uniform in how the UI buttons react or look depending on the app as well on the iPad.</blockquote>

		<hr />
	</div>
</div>You do not need to change the function of the UI to change it's graphics.  Windows is a clear example of this (if you ignore 8).  The basic interface has not changed from xp to vista to 7, but the graphics were updated and the ui has mostly kept with the times.  Even 8, if you disable the metro stuff, is basically an updated version of 7's graphics.<br />
<br />
Android last year updated to ICS, and while this is more like a vista upgrade in the fact there's alot of rewrite, the basic functionality is very similar to previous versions.  But the updated graphics make it look much better.</blockquote>
