When talk turned to my very limited knowledge of the Qur'an, this link turned up (http://www.wikiislam.net/wiki/Allah_the_best_Deceiver#Allah_only_deceives_Enemie s_of_Islam) I had to question the commentary on it.<br />
<br />
To me, this says &quot;$deity is all-knowing and trusted in your capability but not your faith&quot; and to both the entry writer and my friend it says &quot;$deity deceives you as well the enemy because deception is a tool, so the lesson you must learn is to deceive when it is convenient for you to garner the progress you desire&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've basically written off anything but the actual Qur'an quotes(which could be mis-translated?)  (http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/008.qmt.html#008.043)as complete editorial opinion, but would anyone who's read and studied the whole book care to elaborate on this particular bit for me?<br />
<br />
If this guy is a propaganda-absorbing nutter on this particular passage, I'd prefer to head him off with facts and, even better, learn to recognize the bullshit when it shows up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grindel</div><div class="date">September 15th, 2010, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll obviously leave that sort of thing to Muslims who post here, but one could argue that Christianity and Judaism argue on behalf of deceiving when it's convenient as well.  Jacob had a big brother, after all, and Abram had a wife he kept marrying off to other men.  The early chapters of the Old Testament are pretty much shared between all three faiths.  Your friend may not be as schooled on Christianity as he thinks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I highly doubt that he is (dammit, left in a him, I wanted to leave gender out of this) due to me going through 12 years of theology classes for Lutheranism and almost going to cemetary seminary if it weren't for the cash concerns and the massive disagreements with the Bishops on several points of theological interpretation. I generally avoid religious debates like the plague due to experiencing so much unbelievable partisanship between synods amongst the faith of my upbringing in the past, but I despise mis-information. I *have* read the Protestant Bible cover to cover many times in the past and still own several personally footnoted copies and a so-defined &quot;exhaustive concordance&quot; somewhere in the basement that surpasses, individually, the sizes of my collected works of both Shakespeare and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, so the similarities did not escape me, but assuming in the pursuit of knowledge represents at best a temporary incapability to absorb it so I'm trying to refrain from presupposing anything. To wit: while I agree that the resemblance is there, I'm trying not to let it color anything. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lunal</div><div class="date">September 15th, 2010, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The definition of 'deceive' in that article is important - namely, &quot;to make (a person) believe what is not true; delude; mislead.&quot;  To me, that definition works and is not really offensive.  That kind of action is seen in the bible, especially in the old testament, God plays all sorts of tricks on the enemies of Israel.  The one most striking instance was when Gideon &quot;attacked&quot; a vast army of Midianites with 300 men, some trumpets and some clay pots.  <br />
<br />
We wouldn't refer to God as a deceiver just because one of the definitions the wikiIslam article calls &quot;archaic&quot; are actually still in use - namly, &quot;to be false to, betray.&quot;  <br />
<br />
But hey, meta-question time.  Isn't God by definition the best at everything?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">silverblaze</div><div class="date">September 15th, 2010, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me preface this by saying i'm not a Quranic Scholar, but I have been taught several years in Arabic/Quranic school while growing up. So take my opinions as you will.<br />
I assume the text in question is this<br />
<br />
AL-MAKIR<br />
The Planner<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When those unbelievers were plotting against you to imprison you or to kill or expel you: they were plotting and Allah was plotting, but Allah is the Best of Planners . (Surat al-Anfal, 8:30)<br />
<br />
Anything man can do, good or evil, Allah can do better, and he does it the best. Pretty straight forward I would say. Allah has plotted the course for his Messenger and his teachings, the Quran is supposed to be Allah's message, through Mohammad, to the people after all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those who plotted against the just religion throughout history strove to distance people from it for their own selfish desires (e.g., greed for power, personal interests, and so on). In the Hereafter, they will be told: “No, it was your scheming night and day when you commanded us to reject Allah and assign equals to Him.” (Surah Saba', 34:33) <br />
The non believers who tempt the believers away from Islam will pay for it in Hell, presumably, and will be punished for their temptations and scheming. Also, straight forward.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those before them plotted, but all planning belongs to Allah. He knows what each self earns, and the unbelievers soon will know who has the Ultimate Abode. (Surat ar-Ra‘d, 13:42)<br />
<br />
People have tried to tempt and plan against Allah since the beginning, and yet Allah always has a greater plan. Despite what evils may happen in life, the believer will be rightly rewarded and the unbelievers will be punished in the hereafter. Allah, being omniscient, knows all plans.<br />
<br />
As is related in the verse above, “all planning belongs to Allah.” Thus, against all of the unbelievers' plots, Allah devises the best plan. Allah calls attention to the deadlock facing unbelievers:<br />
<br />
All things, whether we perceive them to be good or bad, are within Allah's scope of knowledge, and since he is a benevolent god to his followers, he will always have them in his best interest. My only caveat here is that it's not explicitly said that man cannot always fathom all of Allah's plans, because sometimes his plans may put the believers in dismay or peril, but ultimately all things work out in favor of Allah, whether we understand it or not is immaterial.<br />
<br />
<br />
They concocted their plots, but their plots were with Allah, even if they were such as to make the mountains vanish. (Surah Ibrahim, 14:46)<br />
Any plot against Allah will end up helping his followers and their cause in the end. Regardless of how powerful that plot may be, as in even if they were so powerful as to move mountains, Allah would still have the greater victory.<br />
<br />
<br />
As this verse relates, Allah protects all believers from these plots. This is very easy for Allah, Who turns all plots against His Messengers and believers into failures and makes unbelievers suffer the ensuing dire consequences, for “… Allah is swifter at planning...” (Surah Yunus, 10:21)<br />
Allah protects his followers and turns the plots against them into boons. Unbelievers will be punished, not necessarily in this world, but in the next as well. Regardless of how swift and good their planning is in this world, they cannot out plan and out wit the omnipotent Allah in the here after.<br />
<br />
<br />
No doubt, Allah creates every incident with a purpose and for the ultimate good. He uses the unbelievers' plots against believers to test them. He then extends His help to those servants who can discern the good and beauties in the events He creates, and turns all of these to their benefit.<br />
<br />
Everything Allah does is for the benefit of his followers. But in order to know who is truly a believer he must test them, and this testing is done by the planning of the unbelievers. Thus Allah is able to put the causes and planning of the enemy to good use in testing his followers, and thus reward or punish them for their passing, or failing, of the tests.<br />
<br />
I also think that the commentary on that wiki page is stupidly obtuse. Here's a quote that assume that Allah is only omniscient and not benevolent, which of course makes no sense as we have to assume that Allah is omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent in all things, even if man cannot understand his plans all the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they had been presented correctly - in that 'plotter' is attributed to Allah as well as the unbelievers, then it implies that Allah is also plotting the same type of activities that the unbelievers were [allegedly] plotting.<br />
<br />
Of course Allah is planning, or allowing, the unbelievers to plan their bad deeds. That is how he tests to find his true followers. No one said that Allah is supposed to make life easier for us, he makes our life easier in the here after, as this world is the test and the reward is in the next.<br />
<br />
I also see no real reference to deception in this passage, unless you mean deception in that Allah allows bad things to occur through inaction against the unbelievers. Again, we must assume that Allah is benevolent and thus he knows that allowing an unbeliever free will to tempt one of his followers is in the believers best interest, assuming he passes the test.<br />
<br />
Hope that helped</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I forgot to add in my first post that the use of the word deceiver is deceiving. That is to say, yes, Allah will deceive, trick and fool men, but the intention is not for evil causes, as he is benevolent. The important thing is that the lesson be taught, whether by deception or truth is immaterial. I think people look at the word deceive and automatically think it's an evil act without thinking about the intentions of the action. So yeah, Allah deceives us, but he knows best. As always this requires one to assume Allah is omnipotent, omniscient and benevolent.</div></div><hr />
