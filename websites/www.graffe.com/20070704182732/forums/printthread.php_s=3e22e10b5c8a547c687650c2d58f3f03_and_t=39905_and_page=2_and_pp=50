		<div>just want to be able to compeat with rogues dpswise like we should be doing and im happy<br />
<br />
whatever the case 5 things i hope they consider<br />
1) is giving casters good aa, melees get lot of good dps aa but the main thing casters get is just mana regen and crits<br />
2) like a -40cr/fr debuff clicky aa or spell, cant expect every trash mob for us to be debuffed for us<br />
3) how about reducing mana cost on some of our spell lines instead of increasing mana cost even more! im not looking forward to 1k mana nukes with only 15 mana regen hehe. <br />
4) on our sustained line, i shouldnt be losing mana casting that stuff. would be nice if there were like either a proc or aa that gives them a chance to be free <br />
5) time for a clarity spell(mages too so all caster get one), i think we just way to dependant on mana regen buffs</div>

		<div>kinda a rehash--<br />
<br />
Translocate Bind: TL's target to your bind. (please, for our sanity, make it shardless, just like tl's should be...)<br />
<br />
and one further thought--<br />
<br />
We absolutely need some kind of boost in sustained dps. Every time I nuke, it feels like I'm typing '/rand 90' (or whatever my current focus amount is) to see what I'd land on a nuke... (this's before the initial and secondary resist checks, of course, further hampering my chances).<br />
<br />
This is EQ, not D&amp;D.</div>

Haha, I love that.<br />
<br />
Here is what I would like to see most, and yes, most of it has already been mentioned, so I'm just adding agreement.<br />
<br />
1) Improve our harvest spell and AA to be a percentage of total mana pool. Perhaps 20% for the spell and 40% for the AA.<br />
<br />
2) Mass Teleport. I see no reason why this shouldn't be implemented.<br />
<br />
3) Adjustments to our resist factors on all spells. Since we rely 100% on our spells and are supposedly the Masters of Direct Damage, you would think that we would be better at getting our spells to land. Nothing is worse than spending 5 seconds and 1k'ish mana on a big spell that gets resisted while the melee classes poke, hack and slash away. Standard resist adjustment is -10 when it should really be more like -45.  Even with -50 from pyro and -12 from clicky staff thats -107...not at all unreasonable. Even an AA line that would improve our resist adjustments significantly would be awesome.</div>

I think its a first time that we have been proactive in actually posting what we want and or expect from the new expansion... I hope it was not too late to post over 4 months ago on this topic and that some of our ideas actually made it in, seems in some cases a lot of us share the same ideas. /cross fingers~</div>

		<div>if we're still bumping the thread in hopes of aa's, then here's a few which would be nice to have<br />
<br />
Chromatic Familiar (I know, been said alot, but I'm just mentioning it again :p )<br />
Mass TL to anywhere we can tl<br />
<br />
those have been said alot, but the following idea, I don't ever remember seeing anyone mention:<br />
I would like an aa which would increase our minimum damage for the focuses that we have. For instance, Improved Damage 5 (will there be ID6 now?) has a random 1-20% imp dmg but it would be nice to have an aa with 5 levels that would increase the minimum damage for the focus.<br />
<br />
imp dmg 5, 6, whatever it gets to<br />
lvl 1 - 4-20%<br />
lvl 2 - 8-20%<br />
lvl 3 - 12-20%<br />
lvl 4 - 16-20%<br />
lvl 5 - 20%<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even mind if there were 3 different types of this aa to provide for each of our 3 different spell types, I just think it would be an awesome idea and would boost our dps a little over what it is currently and it definately wouldn't break the game.</div>

Really? I'd like to find the old threads if you can dig them up Qaman... <br />
would be interesting to see what was requested prior and what has actually been Implemented... <br />
Usually from what I've seen it ends up a gripe and moan session when we get stuck with Devs ideas of what spells or AA's are good for us, Instead of just listening to the people that spend about 40 hours or more a week playing the class.</div>

 Mind Crash was suggested by players on one of these types of threads and was implemented.<br />
<br />
<br />
What i'd like to see....<br />
<br />
Spells.<br />
1) Directional Shadowstep<br />
- it's an upgrade, so don't screw with it and make it long recast and stuff. no through the wall crap or anything expected.. just a great escape/travel spell we should have always had.<br />
<br />
2) Snare upgrade, <br />
- less resistable and longer duration  - I don't care if it's AoE, or single.<br />
<br />
3) Harvest upgrade.<br />
- aa or spell.. <br />
<br />
4) Reverse Coth would be nice.<br />
- target player and teleport to them.<br />
<br />
5) Disintegrate Upgrade ( lvl increase )<br />
<br />
6) Dot Absorbtion shield.<br />
<br />
7) Reflect line upgrade .. actually making it useful.. was a great idea .. just not enough.<br />
<br />
8) Huge Ether Skin upgrade.<br />
- most trash hits harder with one swing then this protects us for...it use to be a great line to absorb enough to get a root, or get abscond off .. now it's barely enough to realize you're about to die. I don't care if mana regen on it increases much .. but the amount it absorbs should be 3+ times what it is.<br />
<br />
9) Hasbeen<br />
- this spell summons a random warrior to your side to tank a mob and out dps you at the same time.<br />
<br />
AA's - <br />
1) Aggro reduction over-time ability.<br />
<br />
2) FD upgrade... less mana use or no increased mana use to get the benefit.<br />
<br />
3) Mind Crash upgrade - more aggro reduction.<br />
<br />
4) army of xzul - 3 ranks - each gives an additional sword.<br />
<br />
5) Unleached Destruction <br />
- passive<br />
- when a wizard dies with more then 85 percent of their mana unused - they have a chance to DD the target that killed them - 3 ranks (3/6/9).. each rank increases the chance ( 25/50/75) and also increases the DD damage ( 10k/20k/30k ) - resistable, magic based, can't be focused.<br />
<br />
6) moral booster - jester type avatar that continuously lies to all wizards in range - tells him how great their dps is. Randomly flips off rogues.</div>

		<div>I always like going back through these threads to see what people asked for, what we got and who complained about everything.  This thread has many suggestions that were implemented (Impel, Patient Harvest, Instanukes),  and some that weren't (Disintegrate upgrade, Reverse CoTH). <br />
<br />
What it really had was a lot of good discussion that got us to the spot we are in today, which is KICK ASS.  Yeah, I wish we had MGB TL to &lt;location&gt; and could in place evac while warping mobs back to spawn point.  However, I see how many things we have gotten and play my wizard in happiness. <br />
<br />
Now, if someone could just figure out how to get us Tracking....</div>
