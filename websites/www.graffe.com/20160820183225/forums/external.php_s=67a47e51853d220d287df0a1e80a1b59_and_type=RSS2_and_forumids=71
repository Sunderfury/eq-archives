<br />
So far, it's actually a bit like I expected. You are thrown onto a planet somewhere and you have to figure out what to do. I started off on a Toxic planet so not only did I have to figure out how to repair my ship I had to do it while not dieing from being out walking around. It took a bit, but eventually I figured it out. I will say, that was a surprising amount of fun. More than I expected it to be, really. Where I thought running around documenting living things and changing the names of stuff to &quot;penis&quot; something would be the highlight, I'm actually having more fun trying to upgrade my ship and equipment.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just got my ship ready to leave the system so we'll see how it goes from there. For those of you who like sandbox/survival games this one is probably right up your alley.</div>

Overwatch today launched its first seasonal event, and with it comes the new gameplay mode Lúcioball. As an introduction to Overwatch’s Summer Games, Lúcioball will have players battling it out on a “futuristic soccer field” in a Rocket League-esque seasonal soccer brawl set in Rio de Janeiro.<br />
<br />
Overwatch’s Assistant Game Director Aaron Keller elaborates on the PlayStation blog:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Overwatch’s spin on soccer places you in a fast-paced, 3v3 match featuring Lúcio. Players will hit the field in Rio de Janeiro, punching, bouncing, booping, and wall-riding their way to the goal. Understanding how Lúcio’s abilities affect the ball is the key to mastering Lúcioball. For this brawl, his primary fire has been replaced with a melee attack, allowing Lúcio to punch the ball — perfect for dribbling, passing, and shooting from short range. When you need to launch the ball across the map, Lúcio’s secondary attack emits a blast of sound that gets the job done nicely.<br />
<br />
Unlike other game modes, the speed boost from Lúcio’s song only affects himself (Amp It Up will still increase that boost for Lucio, as it does normally), and Lúcio’s ultimate ability, Sound Barrier, now pulls the ball toward him.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Fans are already going crazy over the new gameplay mode, comparing it to Rocket League, wall-riding and all.<br />
<br />
Lúcioball comes as a part of Overwatch’s Summer Games, in which players can earn limited edition Loot Boxes between today and August 22nd. New emotes, sprays, player icons, highlight intros and skins (even legendary ones!) will accompany the event. Keller explains that, when players earn or purchase Loot Boxes for the next few weeks, they will receive at least one Summer Games limited edition item.<br />
<br />
Check out a stream of Lúcioball here. It’s live now on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Blizzard says that more limited-edition items, maps and modes are in store for the future.<br />

			Three days after releasing the new Ghostbusters game, development studio Fireforge Games filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Kotaku has learned. The company has been liquidating assets throughout July in an attempt to pay off a debt of at least $12 million, according to bankruptcy filings.<br />
<br />
Fireforge, not to be confused with a tabletop company with the same name, may only be known for the recent Ghostbusters game, which was received terribly when it was released alongside the movie on July 12. One possible explanation: The game was developed in just eight months, according to one person who worked on it. On July 15, the company filed for bankruptcy.<br />
<br />
The history of Fireforge goes back much further than one rushed licensed game. Founded in Irvine, California by ex-Blizzard employee Tim Campbell in 2011, Fireforge has started and stopped production on at least two MOBA-like projects over the past five years. One of those games, code-named Zeus, was due to be published by the hardware company Razer. The other game, code-named Atlas, was funded by the Chinese publisher Tencent, which also owns a 37% stake in Fireforge. <br />
<br />
Filings show that Fireforge owes around $11.3 million to Tencent. In addition, the now-bankrupt studio has been entangled in a lawsuit with a Singapore-based private company called Min Productions, owned by Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan.<br />
<br />
Tan alleges that Fireforge failed to deliver on their contract while developing Zeus, and instead used the money to work on Atlas with Tencent. Fireforge, on the other hand, says they only started working on Atlas once Razer had stopped paying them. The lawsuit is currently on hold as Fireforge sorts out their bankruptcy proceedings.<br />
<br />
On top of that, lawyer Richard Land—who was the “receiver” responsible for selling the games and IP of 38 Studios following that company’s closure—sued Fireforge in 2015. Land claims that Fireforge signed a deal to license 38 Studios’ proprietary social media platform Helios for $3.7 million, then reneged and instead hired several ex-38 Studios employees to build their own version.<br />
<br />
More to come as we continue to learn the full picture here. Fireforge CEO Tim Campbell did not return a request for comment.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This is it, the moment everyone's been waiting for: the month when the last video game anyone will ever play finally comes out.<br />
<br />
I am, of course, jokingly referring to <b>No Man's Sky</b>, the space exploration sand box that people have been hyping themselves up for. I sort of expect that it's going to end up disappointing people. How could it not with the insane expectations and hype people are attaching to it? Still, it should be a neat game and be well worth checking out. <br />
<br />
<b>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</b> is also a pretty big game set to release this month. The last game was great, and with a bigger budget I expect the next one to be even better. I forgot to mention it in the E3 thread, but one of the things they are adding to this game (raising a few eyebrows) is some kind of hacker heist multiplayer mode. While it wasn't needed, it sounds like they are at least trying something unique, and impressions from the main game still sound good.<br />
<br />
Not much on handhelds. 3DS is getting <b>Metroid Prime: Federation Force</b>, the game that angered fans that wanted a new &quot;real&quot; Metroid game focusing on exploration. This instead seems to be a multiplayer shooter with an added sports mode to the mix. Will be interesting to see how it is received on launch. I think in this case the branding hurt the product more than it helped it.<br />
<br />
Rounding out the month is a ton of smaller stuff, some of it I don't even recognize. The standouts (for me) are <b>Abzu</b>, an deep sea exploration game, and the start of the new <b>TellTale Batman</b> series.<br />
<br />
<b>Madden</b> and <b>World of Warcraft: Legion</b> are also due this month. The audience for these games probably doesn't need to be reminded of this.<br />
