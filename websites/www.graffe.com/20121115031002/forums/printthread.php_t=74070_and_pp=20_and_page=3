</div>Yes, I need to re-watch that.  I saw the bracelet on Amy and thought that it was Rory who somehow slipped his on her. <br />
<br />
So Rory never got infected then, but both the Doctor and Amy should be infected and if they made Oswald a full Dalek because of her genius and intellect...surely they would aim to do the same with the Doctor.<br />
<br />
I suppose it is possible that the Tardis is somehow able to counteract the nanos but the episode never addresses it.</blockquote>

</div>All points in time are happening at once yet they are linear too.  Because of the duality of being both simultaneous and linear, certain points must be fixed. They cannot change or the whole system will break down.  <br />
<br />
Because  of this duality, if you jump backwards in time, you can change minor  events that carry no significance, but you can't change any fixed points  which are major time events.<br />
<br />
The problem is, how do you know which events are fixed points and which aren't?  We'll only a time lord knows that.<br />
<br />
In the case of the Angels episode, the entire loop of Rory being trapped until he dies is a fixed event, not just his dying day.</blockquote>

</div>Yeah, but that's not the fixed event at the end of the episode. The fixed event of Rory being trapped was caused by Amy seeing him die in the bed and it was obliterated by the mutual suicide of Amy &amp; Rory jumping off the roof, once they did that the loop was broken for good.<br />
<br />
The fixed event at the end was caused by Rory seeing his tombstone, and that is the one that I don't agree with because we saw two different version of the tombstone, the one with just Rory and the one with them both. If it was a real fixed event we would have only ever seen one version of it.</blockquote>
