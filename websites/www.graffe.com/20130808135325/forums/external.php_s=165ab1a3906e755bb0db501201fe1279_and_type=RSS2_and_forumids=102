			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, my initial review: Wait. <br />
<br />
It needs more apps before it's a viable alternative to the mouse for desktop/game manipulation.<br />
Right now, it's a fun toy to make people go &quot;ooh! aaah!&quot; - but that's about it.<br />
<br />
There's a version of Corel Draw that's actually pretty neat - the brush strokes are wider the closer you get to the controller, so it actually feels like you're applying pressure.<br />
<br />
The Touchless App (for controlling the windows desktop via the Leap) that Leap's developed on their own is extremely lacking, and does not support multiple screens in Win7, which is absolutely crucial to me.<br />
There's an app that will be released soon, GameWAVE - I expect a lot out of that one, also from the desktop standpoint.<br />
<br />
Here's a preview video of the GameWAVE:<br />

<iframe class="restrain" title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nnCxsFLUVSM?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"  allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen  mozallowfullscreen ></iframe>
<br />
<br />
I plan on using the Leap for both work and games - if it turns out to be good enough for work use, I'll purchase another for home use.<br />
Will keep you guys posted :)</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>...How can I convince you let me deploy to production servers more regularly?  Team is facing an issue where we're only allowed to deploy at most once every 3 months.  This tends to be a time consuming and tedious process that takes up most of the night and the following morning.  We'd like to be able to knock the time between deployments down (ideally moving towards a Continuous Deployment or Delivery model, but that's a way off).  What would I, as a member of the development team, have to convince you to let us touch production more regularly?</div>
