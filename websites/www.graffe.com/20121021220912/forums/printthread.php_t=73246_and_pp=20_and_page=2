</div>Actually, it depends on what state you are in.  Some allow distilling for personal use.  It isn't the concentration that is the problem, it's the methanol that is created in the beginning and the end of the process that makes distilling dangerous. (IIRC)</blockquote>

Of course, as politicized and divided as this country seems to be currently, I think a severe rollback of the religious right would have to occur first.  So, never presently is the more realistic outlook, IMO.</blockquote>

			<div class="message">I have to wonder where (or when) one must have grown up to never have the chance to try it relatively risk free. Nothing against the conscious choice against it, but I figured most people under 40 would have &quot;known someone&quot; during their high school or college years.</div>

	</div>
</div>I &quot;knew&quot; plenty of people but I grew up in a repressive christian household (if the beat falls on 2 and 4, the music is &quot;of the devil&quot;) and was only allowed to be around christian people for the most part.<br />
<br />
Once I got my first job at 15 we were firmly into &quot;mandatory drug testing&quot; for absolutely everywhere I was either working or was applying to, some of them (especially the warehouse jobs involving driving equipment) had random lottos every week or month to grab a pool of employees and have them tested.<br />
<br />
By the time I was in my 20's and in a band full time, I no longer cared/felt rebellious enough/wanted to get caught with the shit and being on stage was so much of a high it drove most of the musician community into COCAINE instead because nothing else was good enough so I just didn't see the point.<br />
<br />
I've got nothing against it and I certainly don't mind if someone smokes it around me unless I have to go straight back into somewhere that will care if I smell of the stuff without being able to shower/change clothes first.<br />
<br />
I figure I'll try it if/when I ever get to retire or if they legalize it and I *chuckles* ever have any spare cash ever again to throw at it. :D</blockquote>
