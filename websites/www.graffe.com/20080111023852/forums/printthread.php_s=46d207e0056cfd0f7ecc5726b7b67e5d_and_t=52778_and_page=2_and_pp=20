How do you count the wards? If you talk about the different damage types the mob, I’ve seen so far, does only one type of damage. So I think that can’t be what you meant. <br />
I can have a disperse and a reflection ward in addition to Chromatic Barrier and Chromantic Halo up at he same time, I can even counter spells but all wards (ok not Chromantic Halo as far as I have seen in that short time) are gone at he same time. So I think that also can’t be what you meant.<br />
I had only a short time to test Chromantic Halo (as I said I was not 50 at that time and I don’t grouped again with the person so far) but the mob beat me almost dead with out triggering the Chromantic Halo wards. Therefore I think the spell is of limited use.<br />
What experiences do you have with the wards? Maybe they are different then mine. Do you use Chromatic Barrier often? I tried it only few times but I start to miss Fire Barrier very fast and I switch back. Have you already learned Chromantic Halo?</div>

The DMG is really bad, and the manacost horrible. The 25% effect is useless.<br />
To make it even remotely usefull, you have to stack 20% worn spell haste.<br />
You are really gimping yourself if chosing to go with 20% worn spell haste.<br />

As i showed, Taqmir synergises incredibly well with Critic/Int, but still suffers from its 3 second casting time.<br />
It should be lowered to 2.5 so as to be able to hit the GCD with 10% worn Haste.<br />
ATM you need 15% worn haste, thats just fubar.<br />
And the feedback needs to be doubled, it still costs a ton of mana.<br />

		<div>I have really difficulties to disagree with you on the rune thing. I don’t have the experience to predict what the future holds but if I would be a developer and if I developed a cool mob ability I would not like that a stupid rune is killing my cool ability. It would be really too bad if that would be the same for the counter system as well. It would scrap a functionality I really liked (even it needs some major improvement).<br />
<br />
I agree Seradon's Falling Star is not a very useful spell. My point was: just don’t change it to something totally different. It is one of the few cold based damage spells and cold based spells have the concept of movement restrictions. The spell was introduced late and the designer was over careful not to create something too powerful. I think most of the spells have a scaling issue, Seradon's Falling Star is just one other example. The fire based stun is not in line with the concept in my opinion. If you would switch something around that spells to make them consistent and useful I would be ok.<br />
<br />
I don’t know what equipment they introduce with raids. If it would possible to reach 15 haste without sacrificing too much else would the current Taqmir then ok with you? I think you should not design abilities around current equipment gaps. I’ve seen this too often and in most cases it totally messed up the system when they addressed the gaps.<br />
<br />
I did not understand you CV comment. Maybe you could rephrase your suggestion?<br />
<br />
If Forget really has the effect written on the tool tip your suggestion would make Forget more desirable but I think the power cost would then needed to be lowered as well.</div>

		<div>for those of you opposed to most of my tweaks and suggestions, you have to remember that the biggest complaint people seem to have about sorc is how simple they are to play in a group due to spamming cv 1,2,3,4.<br />
<br />
I'm expecting a nerf to CV sooner or later, and the only way to cushion that nerf is to boost up taqs, char, and falling star.<br />
<br />
This will also have the adverse affect of giving viable choices to use for dps while grouping.  Char with additional ticks will make weaving it in with other spells more possible, adding an additional level of complexity if one so desires.<br />
<br />
Taq's is only disadvantage if we remove CV from our lineup is its cast time.  If CV stays the way it is for good, it will need a large boost in damage as well.<br />
<br />
Falling star needs improving.  Easiest way is to remove the root chance, which may be detracting from its damage capability.  I personally feel falling star should be our biggest single target damage nuke.  I know there have been other discussions and posts about making this our big nuke, and for the most part I agree with that view.<br />
<br />
ER needs scaling tweaks<br />
When you first get ER, you can kill 2 dots in 3-4 casts.  Over time it slowly looses that ability, at lvl 50 unless you get lucky with a mimic crit on ER, you aren't going to kill a 2 dot in 3-4 casts.  I understand now why people complained about this ability, because for some, it was a playstyle to them to plop on force barrier and ER 3-4 2 dots dead.  Unfortunately this is only viable in the lower lvls.<br />
Secondly when you compare ER to fireball in terms of energy costs, and total damage, you can see how underpowered ER truely is.  Fireball deals approximately the same total damage as ER, costs less power and is usable from range and doesnt cost endurance.<br />
IF the end cost on ER was removed I dont think anyone would complain about it, however since we know it will stay the energy cost needs a severe reduction, it should cost much less than fireball and deal more damage because of the risk associated with ae'ing mobs within mele range.<br />
<br />
Icequake's scaling is just fubar.  How can you introduce an AE snare and never upgrade it's duration from the first ability to the last.  This makes everyone use the first version because lets face it, the only reason to use it is to snare, not to deal damage, and since the durations dont increase its more power efficient to use the first version that costs much less energy to cast.  Thus allowing more snare casts and longer ae kites.  If the power costs are not adjusted dramatically the snare durations must be rescaled.</div>

you have to remember this is primarilly a pve game.  pvp balancing should not enter a pve discussion and vice versa.<br />
<br />
also, there are many abilities in pvp that ward / rune/ against mele/spell abilities. <br />
<br />
giving sorc the ability to rune against all 6 for 15 seconds with a long long recast imho is not overpowered.   You have to first reconginze who is attacking you, with what abilities, know by memory what 3 schools that class can use, then click off each of those abilities in succession (which would take 6 seconds) if you were not already dead at that time, you might survive long enough to evac.<br />
<br />
the restrictions are already in place on these<br />
long recast<br />
bound by the 2.0s global cooldown.<br />
15s duration<br />
<br />
if you wanted to try to have all 6 up at the same time you would end up running out of immunity in 3 seconds on the first one you casted at the 12th second mark.<br />
<br />
so i dont see how having them separate will be an issue?</div>

		<div>Sasami, If I had to guess Chrom Barrier will be much more usefull in raids (even if the ward is borked the +resists are V.Nice), where you'll have energy regen and haste buffs from other classes to compensate for the loss of Flame Barrier.<br />
I do use CB solo fighting some casters and grouped fighting mobs with AE, but it seems to just be a fairly situational spell.<br />
<br />
Seradons is truly a disapointment to me, maybe when the spell is fixed (the 25% root is just fluff) the graphic could be beefed up a little. I'd like to see a bigger ice chunk and more ice shards sprayed after impact :evil:<br />
<br />
I would prefer a damage increase with taq was dealt with by increasing its already greater crit chance by a few percent per rank. That would give it more substance by increasing its output and keep with the flavor. (assuming crit trully is not capped) Oh and adding the bonus crit % to its tool tip would be lovely ;)</div>

		<div>I don’t know how raid is going to turn out. I could be death all the time with Chromatic Barrier up or it could be a real live saver. I think you will be right with the buffs from the other classes but I will final know only when raid is in. I will wait and see.<br />
<br />
You use CB in solo against caster mob? Bow using mob I’m dead anyway and melee mob should not reach me because I’m kiting. I did not meet a lot of caster mob so far but I try to avoid soloing because I like the interaction of people in groups. In groups I usually do more damage to myself then the mob is doing with AE to me. If the AE is really serious I try to counter it with the reflection ward. I’ve seen rarely mob with serious AEs, overall encounter in VG are in my opinion to easy and I hope this will change with raids.<br />
<br />
25% root is fluff. I don’t care so much about the graphical effects if I need to turn it of because of bad performance. I think VG has a long way to go before improved graphic effects will not be over shaded by bad performance.<br />
<br />
You need to see the improved crit chance for taq in relation to the max crit chance you can reach fully buffed and with max gear.<br />
Two percent more crits is nothing if you go from 10% crit to 12% crit but it gets serious if it moves your chance from 96% to 98% (it halves the non crit casts) and it gets stupid if it increases the chance from 100% to 102%. I don’t know where we are today, my equipment is not so well but I’ve seen people saying lots of the casts are already crits. Increasing crit chance has a scaling issue. You will reach a limit sometimes. If I would need to design this stuff I would be very careful with crits.<br />

I totally agree with your tool tip suggestion.</div>

You may be right but that’s what I hate with MMOs. When you start playing, the class you choose has a certain look and feel. Over time, people whine, complain and the developer change random things. After three combat revamps and two expansions you know for sure the class you play has nothing to do anymore with the concept you liked when you choose the class.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">How do you count the wards? If you talk about the different damage types the mob, I&#8217;ve seen so far, does only one type of damage. So I think that can&#8217;t be what you meant. <br />
I can have a disperse and a reflection ward in addition to Chromatic Barrier and Chromantic Halo up at he same time, I can even counter spells but all wards (ok not Chromantic Halo as far as I have seen in that short time) are gone at he same time. So I think that also can&#8217;t be what you meant.<br />
I had only a short time to test Chromantic Halo (as I said I was not 50 at that time and I don&#8217;t grouped again with the person so far) but the mob beat me almost dead with out triggering the Chromantic Halo wards. Therefore I think the spell is of limited use.<br />
What experiences do you have with the wards? Maybe they are different then mine. Do you use Chromatic Barrier often? I tried it only few times but I start to miss Fire Barrier very fast and I switch back. Have you already learned Chromantic Halo?</div>

A lot of questions ;)<br />
<br />
1. I count them as: 1x Reflect for each spell type from chromatic halo, 1x Mirror ward, 1x Dispersion Ward and 1x Chromatic Halo (i'm counting it only once here, cause i consider recasting it as soon as one of its bubbles is gone)<br />
<br />
2. The wards are &quot;working as intended&quot; imho in pve: per spell casted on you, you'll loose one ward (tho i've experienced some &quot;normal&quot; attacks from mobs seem to be considered as spells, i.e. you disperse one real spell casted on you -&gt; 1. message like &quot;your mirror ward has reflected XY's Spell&quot; and at the same time you'll get a 2nd message like &quot;your dispersion ward has dispersed XY's attack&quot;)<br />
<br />
3. My experiences with the wards are good when it comes to grouping: as soon as everyone is there, i cast the two barriers and chromatic halo with a precedent amplify effectivity. Once i get the mobs turning to me, this gives the tank a few seconds to regain aggro, the healer to switch to me and me some time to fully burn the mob or deaggro ;) If you have an eye on your aggro you should be able to recast all the wards again after the fight.<br />
On the other hand, all the wards are useless while soloing, cause if you're fighting a caster mob, its either a 2/3dot which you should be able to burn anyway or a 4dot+ which takes too long to kill to keep your wards up during the fight.</div>

		<div>It really comes back to equipment. If you compare a green equipped Sorcerer with a yellow equipped Rouge, the Sorcerer does not look good. But it it’s true the other way around as well. Even defensive melee looks good against a green equipment Sorcerer. All that class balancing is so meaningless if equipment has such effects.<br />
<br />
Please don’t balance classes, the only thing which matters: is the class fun to play.<br />
<br />
I really don’t have a problem that Rouges do good damage with good equipment because Sorcerers do decent damage with good equipment as well.</div>

<br />
My experience is that per spell cast you loos all your wards in 80%. It does not really matter if you reflect the spell or not, the ward is gone in most cases.<br />
<br />
For fighting in groups, that spell counter trigger wards does not matter much because the ward of the other group member (tank usually I guess) is gone. But because you where not target of the initial spell, you kept your ward.<br />
<br />
The ward protects you from the first hit of the mob, when the tank looses aggro. With high avoidance you may easily survive two attacks, which gives the tank enough time for a rescue. The ward protects you from melee hits as well. I don’t know from where you get the information that this is working as intended. I never saw an official statement how it should work. I think it is ‘working as “you” expected’.<br />
<br />
For group combat the current behaviour is acceptable for me because I get the useful effect. From the game mechanic point of few I think it’s not correct (and correct game mechanics has again nothing to do with ‘working as intended’). I think the term should be reserved for developers who like to say: ‘I’m not going to look into the details of this and nothing will be done for the issue in the next two month’ but have only time for writing 3 words.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for ticking off on that phrase. But I really hate it.</div>

Nothing of your concrete suggestions, but nerving CV and putting recast on spells would do. I hate when I have to cycle through spells just because everything else is on recast.<br />
<br />
My statement, that classes loose there profile, was not directed against your suggestions (I responded in more detail what I think about your suggestion in another post) instead it was a response to your expectation that CV get nerved. I think that would be the first step to loose the quick and focused cast of Sorcerer game play that is the fun for me.</div>

We both are &quot;full orange&quot; and i'm 3K short of the ToT necklace.<br />
(my 2 yellow, and my 1 blue are the best for their respective slots).<br />
<br />
Our DPS with a good tank is kinda crazy. <br />
These 20K double backstables are far more common than you think.<br />
<br />
I dont envy him, and i dont complain.<br />
When the fights are under 18 seconds (all ToT mobs) he does more dmg than me.<br />
When the fights are over 20 seconds (RI Bosses) i do more dmg than him.<br />
<br />
Nerfing CV will make it useless (it already sucks for a fast pulling group).<br />
What we need a huge boost so that our other spells become better than CV for 14 second fights.<br />
Sure some of them might compete (see my spreadsheet) with 50% spell haste.<br />
But the manacost is so horrible, you'd have to be retarded to use them.</div>

So you are ok? :evilpop: <br />

<br />
I understand your CV comment and I did not argue against that point. Just the opposite, I think messing around with CV will do no good. <br />
<br />
I’m not sure I would need the damage boost for fights less then 14 seconds because I don’t need any fights of less then 14 seconds (I’m looking for challenging fights and I can’t imagine what could be challenging with a less then 14 seconds fights). But at the end, your opinion is your opinion, fine with me.</div>

Actually it was illusive i wanted to quote but nevermind.<br />
I would like to do &quot;more dmg&quot; on short encounters.<br />
Because in a &quot;good group&quot; stuff just dies too fast.<br />
It has been that way since lvl25 in Trengal...<br />
Of course it would be foolish to ask for something that would reliably put me above a rogue.<br />
<br />
But what are our options ?<br />
1) Under 10 Seconds : CV<br />
2) From 10 to 20 Seconds : CV<br />
3) From 20 to 28 Seconds : CV<br />
<br />
Why Because CV is just better than our other spells.<br />
You could make &quot;other spells&quot; compete with CV dps wise.<br />
But for that you would need 20% worn spell haste.<br />
Needless to say, you will be gimping yourself hardcore if you go that way.<br />
<br />
And even if you accept to gimp yourself with 20% worn spell haste.<br />
You will still be using TWO times more mana than with CV.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what do i want ?<br />
I want &quot;fast brutal expensive&quot; spells, that can put me near a rogue.<br />
But at the price of mediocre efficiency.  <br />
<br />
Taqmir is kinda of a good example.<br />
It does more dmg than CV, it costs more mana than CV.<br />
But for it to work, you need a very specific gear set (Haste/Critic).<br />
<br />
And one spell that will put me &quot;above&quot; the rogue, at the price of horrible efficiency.</div>
