			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Made a thread last time they did this, don't remember if anyone took advantage of it. They are doing it again. The selection is arguably less impressive this time, as everything has been on sale individually by this point but if there are some of you that somehow still don't have the first two Dragon Age games, it could be a good deal. <br />
<br />
Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare is also pretty cool, but it's a multiplayer game so your mileage with it will depend on who you play it with. C&amp;C Generals is also really solid, though I doubt the online works anymore and I don't know how it has aged.<br />

Lasts two weeks, they typically add more titles during the second week, though I couldn't guess what they might be.  From what I've heard, the Origin games are all one key, but a few also have Steam keys.</div>

			You can buy easy to perform Fatalities for fighting game Mortal Kombat X.<br />
<br />
We knew MKX would have &quot;Easy Fatalities&quot;; developer NetherRealm had said they added them to the game because some players found normal Fatalities too hard to pull off.<br />
<br />
But now MKX is out, its microtransactions have been revealed, and it has emerged Easy Fatalities are up for sale. You can pay 79p for five Easy Fatalities, or £3.99 for 30.<br />
<br />
Here's the context: each playable character in MKX has two Fatalities, which you can perform after defeating your opponent. Normally, they involve a number of input commands. Cassie Cage's Bubble Head Fatality, for example, is forward, down, back, forward and punch.<br />
<br />
Easy Fatalities are the same end result but easier to perform, and involve holding the R2 button (on PlayStation) and pressing a face button.<br />
<br />
Easy Fatalities can be unlocked through normal play. After a playthrough of the story and an hour or so spent with some of the Tower modes, Test Your Luck and the Test Your Might mini-game, I had a number of Easy Fatalities unlocked for use.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, Easy Fatalities, among other aesthetic items such as costumes and character art, are unlocked from the Krypt, a dungeon players explore from a first-person perspective. To unlock an item you have to spend a set number of MKX's virtual currency, Koins. Everything you do in MKX earns Koins. You cannot pay real-world money for in-game Koins.<br />
<br />
I found finishing the story scored me enough Koins to go on an initial spending spree in the Krypt, but I quickly ran out. I wouldn't describe the rate of Koin acquisition in MKX as inadequate or generous. It's somewhere in between. So, it will take some time to unlock everything from the Krypt, and all of the Easy Fatalities along the way.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that's why you can spend £15.99 to unlock all Krypt items. This will save you a lot of time if you plan on unlocking everything MKX has to offer, but it's worth noting none of the add-ons that are up for sale affect gameplay in any way.<br />
<br />
As you'd expect, MKX has a season pass, called the Kombat Pack. This costs £24.99 and grants early access to four new playable characters and new skins.<br />
<br />
Publisher Warner is also selling the Blue Steel Sub-Zero. A portion of the money made from this will go towards funding the Mortal Kombat X Who's Next Tournament Prize Pool.<br />
<br />
Muscle-bound monster Goro is a pre-order bonus playable character. But he's also up for sale for £3.99.<br />
<br />
Curiously, only the Kombat Pack is available to download for the Steam version of MKX.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I generally like to post trailers all in the yearly and monthly release threads, but a release date hasn't been announced for this yet, and I figure it might be something most of you will want to know about.<br />
<br />
Square/Eidos had this weird interactive event website teasing a new game, which ended up being revealed as the next Deus Ex. It has been revealed to be Game Informer's cover story for the month (as one of the few print magazines for games left, they plan these reveals well in advance). I honestly did not follow this stuff that closely, beyond waiting for a trailer to be posted.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can say with any certainty, and the most important takeaway, is that it is a direct sequel to Human Revolution and features the return of Adam Jensen. The trailer even has direct allusions to the ending of the first game. <br />
<br />
This is a big win for fans of the franchise. Turning IPs into mobile or mmo games and leaving their core audience behind is very common these days. I wasn't sure if we would even get a direct sequel. I was expecting a crappy mmo wannabe like Square is doing with other Eidos properties.<br />
<br />
The trailer itself is pretty good, but it doesn't compare to the trailer for Human Revolution in my opinion. Still pretty exciting though.<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This game recently came to my attention and I decided to try it out. I didn't particularly like it myself, but I think there are aspects of it that might make it something you guys would want to know about, and thus the thread.<br />
<br />
Mobile gaming is a big thing right now, and with declining profits in traditional spaces, a large number of Japanese developers have been resorting to experimenting with mobile games in order to survive, much to the dismay of traditional gamers yearning for new entries in their favorite IPs. I don't want to get too offtopic here, just to say that Square is no exception.<br />
<br />
Record Breaker is the newest entry in a series of such projects. It's a free to play game, and while supposedly not as egregious as most, it has many of the things you would expect from such a game. You have stamina that must be recharged over time before you can do more battles, you can buy chances for loot, etc.<br />
<br />
The format and story of the game is that you exist in a world that chronicles fictional adventures from other universes, and preserves them as paintings in a special magical museum. These paintings thus inspire peace in that world itself. The paintings begin to disappear, and it's your job to bring them back by &quot;reliving&quot; those moments.<br />
<br />
As you can probably guess, those fictional universes are all from numbered Final Fantasy games. The tutorial has you &quot;reliving&quot; the first Mako generator battle in FF7. What this really means, and why I keep putting it in quotations, is that you fight battles themed to that game and that plot. You don't replay the actual sequences themselves. When you are done you get a screenshot of the original game and some sort of text blurb referencing it.<br />
<br />
So it's classic 8-16 bit Final Fantasy ATB combat. Meters fill, then you can select commands. It's actually simplified a great deal (attack, defend, two magic spells, special) and in my opinion is a little brainless, but it serves a purpose which I will get to in a bit. Each painting tends to consist of a few rounds of battle, and sometimes a boss, all relevant to the game in question. <br />
<br />
For completing a painting, you are awarded points based on how well you did, and earn a variety of rewards, from weapons and armor, to new party members. Aside from the main character, party members are all from their respective Final Fantasy games, and you can set up your party composition however you want (although the game did inform me that using characters in their own specific worlds gives stat bonuses).<br />
<br />
<br />
So the reason why I am making a thread about this at all is for the nostalgia. The sprites and the music in particular are great for this reason. While if you want something meatier there are arguably better options, this provides an adaptation of ATB combat that doesn't have to be particularly time consuming.<br />
<br />
I am sure there are some of you that like old rpgs, but don't have the time to get into newer ones. This is essentially a classic Final Fantasy game that you can play in ten minute chunks. <br />
<br />
It's available both for ios and Android. I won't be playing any more of it myself, but if any of you do feel free to share your likes or dislikes.</div>

			<description>If March was a flood of new game releases, April is pretty barren in comparison. Even the deluge of PS3 Japanese games has slowed to a trickle. There are certainly a few things to look forward to, but most of us will likely find this time better spent playing the things we bought last month.

There are certainly a few things to look forward to, but most of us will likely find this time better spent playing the things we bought last month.<br />
<br />
There is really only one big new release coming this month, and that's <b>Mortal Kombat X</b>. You should already know if this is the sort of thing that appeals to you or not. The gratuitous violence is being fully embraced, with some of the most disgusting fatalities yet. Whether you like going :wtf: or want to be a cool kid that pretends it doesn't bother you, your bases are covered.<br />
<br />
The Double Fine kickstarted adventure game <b>Broken Age</b> is also set to be finally finished this month, with Sony platforms getting ports of the complete package. I assume those of us with part 1 get part 2 for free, but haven't been following development that closely to say for sure.<br />
<br />
The 3DS is getting a decent month, with a port of <b>Xenoblade</b> being the main attraction. It's very important to know that you need the new 3DS sku (literally named &quot;New 3DS&quot; in stores) to be able to play it, as it has a faster cpu.<br />
<br />
Sony platforms in general are getting a lot of ports of games from other platforms as part of their Spring sale I mentioned last month. The only fully original game for the PS4 this month is <b>Omega Quintet</b>, a jrpg from Compile Heart, also known as the B(or C?) team of jrpgs. Be aware that the game is idol themed, so unless you are into that stuff, you might want to just pick up Type 0 from last month instead. FYI: idols = teen pop stars that sing and dance. <br />
<br />
Both new platforms (PS4 and Xone) are getting ports of <b>Dark Souls 2</b>. I do not know if they fixed the lighting engine. It might be interesting to see how this is, but I get the feeling it's mostly going to appeal to xbox users who can't play Bloodborne.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, as far as I am aware <b>Mighty No 9</b> is supposed to come out this month, but being a digital game, I'll believe it when I see it. This is the spiritual successor to Megaman that was kickstarted awhile back. It should be pretty good.<br />
<br />
