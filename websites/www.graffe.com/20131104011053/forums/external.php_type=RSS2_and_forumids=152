			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I used to put this little tidbit of myself into stand up comedy. It made crowds laugh, but it was truth. I actually was a fart craftsman, and over the course of many years, my brother, a few roommates, and a couple close friends and I have discussed, in great detail, the beauty of farts. <br />
<br />
In general, some foods just have a terrific transposition from solid into gas. Carrots, Milk, Beans, as well as many other foods each have completely distinctive and different qualities about them as they make their way through one's gut. Beans tend to break down into not-so-smelly loud expulsions of air, whereas carrots, can clearly be smelled on last night's menu, the more silent, the more vivid. Hearty stews showcasing carrots, beans, and cheese as a thickener will really clear a room if kept in long enough. <br />
<br />
I've never been shy with my farts; not since I invited a gal over to my house to learn how to breakdance, over 10 years ago, and had just finished eating a real mash of Mac n' Cheese and Chili. She came over, we started watching Lord of the Rings, and it seemed we both had our own ideas of breakdancing on the couch, until my gut began air-transfer operations. For 3 hours, I sat perfectly still, and didn't make a single move - not on her, and not on my life. When it was time for her to go, i didn't even walk her to the door. i feigned sleep. As soon as I heard her car turn on, I stood up and started letting them go. In a torrential stream, I wandered from the couch to the front door, put the chain and the deadbolt on the door, wandered to the bathroom and brushed my teeth, bent over to pick up my dental floss off the floor that I'd dropped (thinking that would get the rest of it out) and finally went to bed. That whole span of 2, maybe 3 minutes, my ass ripped non-stop, and it didn't stop until I forcefully pushed with my own two hands on the sides of my gut. <br />
<br />
After that experience, I decided there was no way I could be with any woman who could not appreciate, or at least tolerate, a fart - and by tolerate, if she could not, she should at least have the survival instinct to flee the room. I needed to know that my coming progeny would not be ushered around by some woman without the skill of avoiding certain toxic gases and other terrorist incited barrages. <br />
<br />
<br />
On that note, my wife and I first got intimate almost 8 years ago. After spending the night, all the proteins in my stomach having been burned as they made their way through my gut and wherever else my stamina used them throughout the night, I remember leaning in close to her, as her head lay sort of covered beneath her blankets and pillows, lifted and uncovered her face, and rubbed my face across hers, and my hand across her hair, until she slowly opened her finely clenched eyelids to acknowledge I was still there. I knew what I had to ask her that very moment. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever been interested in performing a fart transfer from one person to the other?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her quick laughter meant that she heard me right, and her brain had processed it, but the gargling, almost gagging cough that followed it, meant that the rest of her body began to register what it all meant.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So I've been in my house a year, and I'm already annoyed by oil heating.<br />
<br />
Natural Gas isn't in our neighborhood (hope that changes, a company is looking at it).<br />
<br />
I am trying to figure out a cheaper alternative. I'm open to any ideas. Trying to avoid MAJOR upfront costs, but it really depends on what it is and how much it will save me in the long term.<br />
<br />
I'm in Delaware if that helps.<br />
<br />
Just made a basic layout of my house.<br />
<br />
Been looking at Wood Stoves, Pellets, Solar, Geo-thermal....I just don't quite know where to go that makes sense.<br />
<br />
Thanks if anyone has any ideas. I appreciate it.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Garlic Soup with Onion<br />
<br />
4 full, unpeeled, heads of garlic<br />
1 half small onion (white or yellow) chopped small<br />
3 tablespoons olive oil plus extra<br />
salt<br />
fresh cracked black pepper<br />
1/2 tsp rosemary (I used a 2-inch fresh rosemary sprig) <br />
1 bay leaf<br />
1/4 cup flour<br />
1 Qt Chicken stock (low sodium if you wish)<br />
Garnish (chopped parsley, minced dill, chiffonade basil, etc)<br />
<br />
Cut the heads of garlic in half.<br />
Gently oil a roasting pan (cookie sheet, flat-bottomed casserole, etc).<br />
Place bottoms on pan and liberally cover cut-side of bottoms with olive oil.<br />
Sprinkle a little salt and grind some fresh black pepper onto the bottoms.<br />
Salt/pepper an area of oiled pan and place the head tops cut-side down.<br />
<br />
Roast at:<br />
300 degrees for 1 hour<br />
OR<br />
350 degrees for 40 minutes<br />
OR<br />
400 degrees for 20 minutes<br />
until the garlic is golden brown (NOT dark brown) and remove from oven.<br />
<br />
Add 2 Tbsp olive oil to medium pot and heat on low.<br />
(Using gloves if you wish)<br />
Remove the garlic from the pan and carefully &quot;pop&quot; the cloves out of the paper head body into the medium pot.  Discard papers and blackened garlic; also remove papers carefully from roasting pan.<br />
<br />
Sprinkle flour 1tsp at a time onto roasting pan and using a spatula/rubber scraper, work the flour into the oil and scrape into the pot.<br />
Using a potato masher (or equivalent) mash the garlic into the scrapings from the roasting pan.<br />
Add remaining flour 1tbsp at a time, continuing to mash garlic, until as smooth as possible.<br />
Heat on low for around ten minutes, stirring/re-smashing occasionally.  It should NOT be vigorously bubbling or sauteing.<br />
<br />
Add chicken stock a little at a time, stirring to incorporate as much as possible.  Add rosemary and bay leaf.  Heat on medium-low to medium for 20 minutes.  It'll bubble but shouldn't boil.  Stir occasionally.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, sweat OR saute the onions in a separate pan with remaining olive oil.  (We did a mix of small chop and medium chop for texture difference) <br />
When the onions start to get fragrant (or start to color, if sauteing) add contents of pan to pot and mix.<br />
<br />
Heat for 5-10 more minutes, stirring occasionally.<br />
<br />
Garnish and serve (remove rosemary and bay leaf as necessary).</div>
