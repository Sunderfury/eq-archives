				<title>The February '11 Release Thread</title> 
				<description>I wouldn't say February is packed, but it's a pretty good month for releases.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the most notable notables include the highly anticipated Marvel Vs Capcom 3, Killzone 3, and Dragon Quest 6.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Less immediately recognizeable titles that I also have high hopes for include:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the Tactics Ogre remake, a tactics styled srpg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bulletstorm, an over-the-top action and combo based fps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radiant Historia, which I will get to in a moment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I also want to point out that Knight's Contract is one of the interesting titles I posted back during TGS (or was it E3?) about an immortal protecting a witch. I have heard nothing</description>

				<title>The January '11 Release Thread</title> 
				<description>The new year has begun! January is pretty light. Most of us will still have plenty of time to continue wrapping up 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The two biggest titles are probably Dead Space 2 and LittleBigPlanet 2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Wii gets a disc version of a popular Wiiware game. The PC and 360 get a download-only (I think) fps game based around destructibility, and does anyone know if DCU comes out this month or not? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I still haven't played the original Dead Space, otherwise I would be interested. I was thinking of skipping LBP2, but my sister is looking forward to it, so what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

				<title>Humble. Indie. Bundle. #2.</title> 
				<description>Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.humblebundle.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.humblebundle.com&lt;/a&gt; !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those of you not in the know, the Humble Bundle is this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some Indie developers make some software. There are five. Each puts up a game for sale. Each will take an even split of the &quot;developer&quot; slice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humble Bundle Inc. Packages them up, creates a website, and sells them. They take a slice for running the show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They partner with Child's Play and the EFF to accept donations as part of the proceeds. Each charity will take a slice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They let you decide how much to pay. &lt;u&gt;You&lt;/u&gt;</description>

				<title>The December '10 Release Thread</title> 
				<description>To the best of my knowledge, there are very few games being released this month. The primary shopping season is just about past.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's Cataclysm, a Tron tie-in game, and &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt; Sony's spy mmo and &lt;i&gt;maybe&lt;/i&gt; the first Telltale Back to the Future game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since there aren't many new releases to talk about, why don't we mention the games we enjoyed most over the entire year, and which games we skipped and would like to take this opportunity (through bargain hunting or gifts) to get back to. It's still too early to worry about next year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

				<title>The November '10 Release Thread</title> 
				<description>This is the month Kinect finally comes out. Personally, I have not seen a single commercial. Microsoft instead seems to have been pumping a lot of money into product placement in TV shows, or spots on various talk shows. They aren't trying to sell a product as much as they are trying to create the illusion that Kinect is an integral part of popular culture. It will be interesting to see how it pans out. Anyone here the slightest bit interested in picking it up? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aside from that, there are still several big games coming out this month, although perhaps not as many as last. Like it or not, the top dog is arguably Call of Duty: Black Ops. Although AC: Brotherhood is also getting a lot of positive buzz.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Wii continues</description>
