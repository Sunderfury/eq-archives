			<description>When do we get to see the new spells and the new AAs from SoD? 
 
Is it the day of the release or do we get a sneak preview before hand? 
 
I have only participated in a beta a couple times and was never under an NDA.</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Just curious about this AA but have a few questions before doing any idea to purchase them later on.<br />
<br />
Now as it says each rank gives the chance to block an enemy attack completely. I have a few questions however about this tho.<br />
<br />
1: Does this also go for spell damage?<br />
2: Will or can it possibly stack with Combat Agility or Combat Stability in some way? (meaning if Agility or Stability would help the chance of if an attack landed. A check would be seen on if the shield block AA would null the attack if it supposedly lands)<br />
3: Is there any said ratio on how much each rank does in terms of success in blocking an attack?<br />
<br />
Now before I perhaps get questioned on why I would want such an AA no matter what the reason is to not have it. I will say that in high end type raids (which i hope to soon learn much about upon SoD's release to partake in). I find it the idea to have defense over offense. <br />
<br />
Seeing if you can last longer. You can dish out a bit more and survive a bit longer. Yes I know higher dps or bigger hits may be worth it. But would it not also be worth it to stay in longer if oh say some AoE DoT lands on everyone and hits for about near 1K a tick. To last a bit longer perhaps.<br />
<br />
That is of course if it blocks spell damage in some way. <br />
<br />
But thanks for the time to answer these if possible.</div>
