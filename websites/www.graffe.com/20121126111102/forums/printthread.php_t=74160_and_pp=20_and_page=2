			<div class="message">There is a very reasonable argument against capital gains tax in that it is a &quot;double tax&quot; - you're taxed on the money when you first make it as income, then you're taxed on it again when you invest it.</div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Uh, NO.  You're only taxed on what you extract from the investment, not on the investment itself.  If you invest one meeelion dollars, and your investment pays a hundred thousand the first year, Your investment is in a transferable format that you can sell to recover your original meeeelion dollars.  So you are holding something VALUED AT one meeelion dollars.  <br />
 <br />
Now your investment pays you a dividend.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars, so now you have both a hundred thousand dollars cash money, but you also hold a stack of certificates you can sell for about a meelion dollars.  So you have one meelion, one hundred thousand dollars now.  You just made a hundred thousand dollars in capital gains!  If you sell your stocks, you don't pay tax on the meelion dollars from that, because your prior investment counts as an itemizable personal deduction.  So you do NOT get double-dipped for investing.<br />
 <br />
Wanna really piss off the investor class?  Start charging State Sales Tax for every purchase of stocks or bonds.  MUAHAHAHA!</blockquote>

Charging sales tax on stock purchases would be like charging sales tax when someone changes dollars to euros - it kinda doesn't add up.<br />

Maybe you should get charged a sales tax proportionate to your holdings: Own 100% of the stock and pay the full 20% sales tax!<br />

</div>Not really sure what that has to do with what I wrote. The sales tax owed could be judged yearly like a tax return, so whether they bought the company all in one go or incrementally, they could be charged the same rate. <br />
<br />
I know that makes it different to a normal sales tax which is charged 'real-time', but, as I say, I don't think the ordinary guy in the street who buys 0.00001% of company X in his pension portfolio should be paying 20% sales tax on it. Only the guys who own enough of a company for their vote to count should be paying that.</blockquote>

The strange thing is, if I try and show statistics like that to conservative friends; they couldn't care less.  They think its pointless because it would be fruitless trying to eliminate the loop-holes and shelters these companies use to avoid taxes, because even if we did, they would simply pass the additional costs on to us, (the consumers), through price increases.<br />
