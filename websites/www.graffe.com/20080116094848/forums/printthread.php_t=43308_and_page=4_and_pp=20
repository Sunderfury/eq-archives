		<div>&gt;In regards to the efficiency of the spells I would say Tier2 should be more efficient. Figure those are the &quot;Group&quot; spells. Raiding spells are not about efficiency most of the time. You are not usually looking for sustained DPS. I don't know if the Devs looked at it the same way, but the grouping type spells should always be the more efficient spells even if they are not the biggest bang.<br />
<br />
They don't really look at it that way because you can't have more than 1 of a tier at a time, and it will always be the highest ranked spell that you have gotten. So doing what you would suggest would actually cause problems.<br />
<br />
&gt;The other question I had is if there was any discussion on Wizards getting a group version of fixed invis or a self invis AA? Lev would be another that has some usefulness. Not sure how much people would want that, but I find I am the best chance for invis in a lot of the groups I am in. Group version even of non fixed would be really nice at times like running from the WoS port in to MPG without training anybody at the zone in.<br />
<br />
There is a second tier of invis coming that will make a lot of those obsolete Edimas. It was pulled to give them more time to work on the system.</div>

		<div>No problems.  Just a matter of who will get which spells.  If the Tier3 spell is slightly less efficient then it will probably be balanced out by the focus effect that the raiding person would have over the grouping person.  In this case it is a matter of focus for the person getting it.  If you group a lot more than you raid then it might be worth it to you to stop at the Tier2 version and never scribe the Tier3.  If it is the other way around you are looking for bang more than efficiency so staying with Tier2 would not be in your best interest.<br />
<br />
I am also not talking about massive changes either.  Figure a couple mana/damage adjustment could be enough to make a sizable difference over sustained time frames.<br />
<br />
For the most part it does not make much difference until we can play with the new spells and aggro reduction tools to see where we fit in.  I suspect once the resist changes go into effect we will see less complete resists, but lots more partial resists.  Hopefully aggro will no longer be our biggest block any longer and now it is a matter of how much we can cast in X period of time.  I will be happy if I see more of other classes names in the HoTT box than just Edimas.  Then we can play with those parses and see just what we can chain cast for improved DPS.</div>

		<div>I was just about to respond to the numbers thread, then I started thinking and believe it would be better here.  Just noticed something though.<br />
<br />
Since they took out leap of flame, do we get any efficient &quot;little&quot; fire nuke above level 70, as an upgrade to chaos flame?  I didn't see one.<br />
<br />
If not, then if we want to be efficient with fire we'll have to use both the level 70 chaos flame and the level 70 ether flame, since GGoM won't proc off of chaos flame to use with EC.  Is this intended, in order to force us into using a combination of the new cold nuke for efficiency with the big fire nuke?<br />
<br />
In this regard, since the new concussion is the proper level, takes mana to cast and has a casting time, will it proc the new GoM?</div>

		<div>from my interpretation all that the new gom does is allow gom to proc off and be used by lvl 71to 75 spells.  There is not an old gom and a new gom.  they are the same gom and this simply allows u to use spells over 70.  That means u can still use chaos flame to proc gom and then use the new big nuke</div>

		<div>We probably won't get an upgrade to CF until next expansion. CF was better than the Leap though, as far as effciency goes. I am hoping the change the EF/EC issue though, it is kind of silly (not sure if this was resolved yet actually). Your best bet for efficiency has been Claws though, CF was just close when combined with Pyro.<br />
<br />
&gt;In this regard, since the new concussion is the proper level, takes mana to cast and has a casting time, will it proc the new GoM?<br />
<br />
I think GoM only procs off of spells that change hitpoints, so probably not.</div>

		<div>From posts im assuming we can no longer have multiple tiers of the same spell now and are overwriting each other?<br />

The tiering is a complete joke, why do the spells NOT get more efficient, mightaswell use tier1 Sothgars for all it matters, better DPM when combined with the new EF for about 60 less DPS.<br />
<br />
I just hope we're going to see some upgrades in gear, im extremely concerned by lack of foci upgrades in spdat atm, though that can be easily fixed. Maybe we'll eventually get crit gear, or ancient spells if added will actually be better than tier1, though if the Prat is still doing spells im very skeptical.</div>

It's not at no DPM cost though, rank1 is 3.5% MORE efficient with GoM and new EF taken into account<br />

Edit: Ooops, something was wrong with my spreadsheet, is only 0.8% difference which i guess is negligible, still ridiculous that they dont gain any efficiency though</div>
