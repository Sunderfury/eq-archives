			Blizzard has officially canceled development on its mysterious next-generation massively multiplayer game Titan. The company confirmed the news to Polygon in a recent interview.<br />
<br />
This revelation comes after at least seven years in development and word last year that the developer was going back to the drawing board to reevaluate the project.<br />
<br />
Speaking to Polygon, Blizzard co-founder and CEO Mike Morhaime reiterated that the company has technically never officially announced Titan, though it hasn't been shy to talk about the game over the past seven years. &quot;We had created World of Warcraft, and we felt really confident that we knew how to make MMOs,&quot; Morhaime said. &quot;So we set out to make the most ambitious thing that you could possibly imagine. And it didn't come together.

</div>Forgot they were even working on it to be honest. But it's canceled now.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Didn't want to keep cluttering up the WoD thread with my questions, but been playing a few days now and there are things I'm curious about.<br />
<br />
1 - I see people talking about daily quests a lot.  What level do those kick in?  I haven't seen any yet, but my highest player since returning is 22<br />
<br />
2 - I don't remember this from when I played before, but none of my caster characters autoattack with their staff.  Do casters not swing their weapon ever?  <br />
<br />
3 - Are there any lower level quests that give you a mount?  I bought one for my monk, but wondering if there's a way to get a freebie somewhere?<br />
<br />
4 - What are the cheapest 10+ slot bags I can get?  <br />
<br />
Guess that's enough for now :)<br />
<br />
On a side note, I was surprised that the starting zones are really pretty much the same as they were back at release.  A few different quests here and there, but pretty much the same.  Then I got to Darkshore and saw the effects of the Cataclysm. Wow, that was quite a change.  Almost saddening to see what happened to a zone I spent a lot of time in back during beta and release.</div>
