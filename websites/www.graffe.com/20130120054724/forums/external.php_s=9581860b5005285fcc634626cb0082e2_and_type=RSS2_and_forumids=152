			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I recently started back running again after growing tired of my previous cardio routine (elliptical).  I have some running shoes already, but in the interest of not damaging my feet after continual long runs I thought I would try the toe shoes.  I was doubtful at first, and they look strange to be sure, but the reviews were so fantastic from runners and the health effects of running in general is a much worse outcome that I thought to try them.<br />
<br />
The ones I purchased were these: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vibram-FiveFingers-Grey-Palm-Shoes/dp/B001JYDEYU/ref=sr_1_1?s=shoes&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358618941&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Vibram+Fivefingers+Kso+Mens+Running+Shoes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Vibram-FiveFin...+Running+Shoes</a><br />
<br />
I've been wearing them for a few weeks now, and so far they have been great.  Your stride changes a bit but will become habit after a week or so, but these shoes really show off how impressively well engineered humans are for the most part.  Unlike popular opinion until recent research, our feet are actually incredibly well designed, able to dynamically adjust to different terrain to optimally apply the stress endured while running, which is a tremendous strain on our knees and feet and ankles unless you go barefoot.  <br />
<br />
I highly recommend these for those of you who do run or want to start running to avoid injury that would take you out of exercising for a while and hurt the performance gains you've made.  With these I can go for morning runs for miles everyday and not worry about being side lined after a few months.  I just wear some thin socks with them, but some people wear them barefoot.  I like to wear at least some socks though as shoes tend to get smelly otherwise, and rubber is not very kind to removing odor.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've made this quiche recipe a few times now and it has turned out really great.  It's pretty easy to make too.  One thing I should mention is that you must not use frozen vegetables in the recipe.  I did that the first time and the extra water that comes from the ice on the vegetables is disastrous for the result.  Chopping them by hand though and then using that instead resulted in a fantastic dish.<br />

Then I realized how bad this idea was in a country where people carry hand guns.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I think I am going to have to end up just building this myself, but I would prefer not to.  I am not sure what to actually look for search term wise and have just been browsing in departments.  Basically here is what I want.  I come home every day and empty my pockets or have additional items that I want with me every day when I go out but I also want to have them in a central location for when I need them at other times outside of that.  <br />
<br />
It would contain my wallet, leatherman, phone, keys, tablet, and compact flash light.  The phone would need to be segregated from the other tools and items so that the screen does not get scratched.  Preferably the container would hang on the wall so as to utilize z-axis space more effectively instead of taking up room on the floor or counters.  Possibly the container would be such that it could hang above wall outlets and allow for easy connection of the devices inside the container to its associated charger.</div>
