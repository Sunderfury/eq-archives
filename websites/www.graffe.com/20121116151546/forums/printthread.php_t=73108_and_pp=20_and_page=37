</div>This strikes me as kinda funny and exemplifies a mindset that I think is a problem for min/maxers.  Maybe they set the cap high enough so that you could just do as much as you wanted, not as some goal that you are expected to meet. <br />

</div>If they wanted us to do &quot;as much as we wanted&quot;, there would be no valor cap. Players would be free to consume the content like goldfish until they burst. I'm happy that I'm getting valor from daily quests I'd do for rep anyways, but once the associated reps are capped I can't see myself continuing to do them - and I enjoy quest content.<br />
<br />
So early this morning I decided to go looking for those dirt mounds that contain the individual rep items for The Tillers. It's amazing how many of them you can farm up when nobody else is looking for them. I ended up with just under 70 of them farmed up in a little under an hour. IF (and that's a giant &quot;if&quot;) I can continue to do that for a week, I'll have almost all the individual rep work done and I won't need to farm food. Fingers crossed!</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">The individual rep for tiller's members is largely irrelevant.  They only reward cosmetic and convenience items for the farm.  Turning in the dirt items doesn't give tillers rep, so it does not help you enlarge your farm at all.  And by the time you do enough dailies to max out your farm you'll likely have high rep with them all anyway.  You might get a little rep for the final quest when maxing out individual farmers, but it's not enough to really matter in the long run.<br />
<br />
The one you should be doing now, or rather done days ago, is cloud serpents. They are basically netherwing.  And collecting onyx eggs let me get to exalted the 3rd day of launch.  But a week from now will be packed and you'll be stuck doing dailies for weeks for the same result.  Of course, they don't have valor gear, just mounts and toys.<br />
<br />
To answer your question Naean, it's not about the cap, it's about the effort required to get the gear.  Basically, valor is 4x harder to earn now than before, but the items cost the same.  in cata / wotlk you could run 7 heroics a week or kill 9 raid bosses.  Now, to get that same amount of valor, you need to do 30+ heroics or 250 dailies a week for the same result.<br />
<br />
It's not about capping every week.  Capping just gets you to the end sooner.  I'm complaining about the requirement to earn valor in the first place.  It's too high, it places the carrot too far away, and frankly, I won't chase it.  It's an unrealistic expectation to think anyone will do all that.<br />
<br />
I'll likely cap this week simply because we're running heroics for gear, and I'm doing dailies for reputation.  But next tier?  No way, that gear will just sit on the vendor.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">And the odd thing about is, last expansion, people didn't bother grinding out valor upgrades even if they were non-raiders because it took too long and was too boring. If they had the JP gear, they considered themselves &quot;done&quot;. So... the devs made valor take much, much more effort. Something people already didn't bother doing, they made take a ton more work. That's not the way to get people into your game.<br />
