			<div class="message">My engineer is 73 and things are getting both simultaneously more awesome and more sucky. Starting to notice the death zone phenomenon, the buggy events, etc. Also, as prophesied in another thread, the story has taken a turn for the WTF. (Though I loved the first bit. If you roll a human, select never-joined-the-circus!) <br />
<br />
As an engineer I have a problem of too many potential playstyles. I tried bombs for a while, but I was too squishy to make that work, although it rocked when kiting melee. Grenades are amazing underwater. Flamethrower is, sadly, lackluster: strafing around can cause it to miss. :( Turrets are dumbfire, and I endured enough of that as an EQ mage!<br />
<br />
Still having fun though. I have a guardian who is a pretty kitty in a hat, and she is a raging whirlwind of death with a greatsword.</div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I like pistol pistol grenade kit with explosives and firearms maxed for PvE.  In PvP switch pistol to rifle (change your talents) for more control and have rocket turret and rifle turret up just for the two toolbelt skills (great DD).  I have a crit DD build with a good bit of toughness and vitality built in too.  I use the red golem in PvE and the turret box in PvP.  If I was only doing PvP I would have a different build but this build is more for dungeons.<br />
<br />
Oh and with grenades, you MUST put your 1 button on your mouse.  It makes a HUGE difference.</blockquote>

The 3 bugged areas I was needing were fixed, but I hear people in game talking that there are some others that weren't.<br />

<br />
1 - Roj the Rowdy Butcher skill point in Diessa Plateau<br />
2 - The skill point in the far north of Snowden Drifts - Corvin the Skaald<br />
3 - the Skrittsburg area of Brisban Wildlands; tunnels were bugged and you couldn't get into that area<br />

<br />
Note that I don't think this necessarily means the bugs themselves were fixed. I think that through enough repetitions events just break down, and stay that way until the server itself is reset. But before recently they were resetting everything nearly every night so bugged events weren't quite as blatant.<br />

</div>It's pretty simple if you think about what drives the behavior in the first place. Once a path of least resistance has been found, an exploiter has no reason to do anything else, including looking for other exploits. It's only after one gets fixed that they move on and discover another one.<br />
<br />
Although the patch notes also suggest they themselves made the exploit possible by accident when fixing something else. I'm not sure how, because I don't know the details about the exploits in the first place.</blockquote>

</div>You aren't playing in populated enough zones then. It's such a mixed bag, on some days map chat will be extremely pleasant, and on others it will be garbage from the bowels of hell. A high number of people in a zone almost guarantees a few trolls. It's the same phenomenon really, as the entire reason why barrens chat was so bad was because that zone was so large and had so many people in it.<br />

			<div class="message">the amount of times I've died in dungeons due to people rushing to rez my clone and not me has effectively stopped me from using my downed #2. <br />
<br />
I even let them know that I have a red skull over my head but some people just can't be aware. Even my guildmates derp it up in the heat of battle and I'm just laying there QQing until I self bandage or die.</div>

</div>Man, screw you guys and screw your clones! I hate those freaking things. :p The clone has a name tag just like you, and the only difference I have noticed is a different colored name, which I don't have the patience to figure out. I once rushed to rez a guy, then got confused and started rezzing his clone instead, argh. I've never seen a red skull. <br />
<br />
I love rezzing people, but I've usually got other things I need to be paying attention to at the same time, like dodging the inevitable aggro pull rezzing seems to cause half the time.</blockquote>
