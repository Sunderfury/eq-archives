The fault with instants was not instants, it was what was arount them. We simply had nothing else to use. So we used only instants.<br />
When WMS was fixed we were exited like WMS is such a great nuke and all of us used it extensively. Truth be told WMS is not such a great nuke but compared to what else was there it was light years away.<br />
It does not take great imagination to make wizards a very exciting and effective class with predifined goals. We are burst DPS, we ought to be called to unload large amount of dmg in a short timeframe. Instants are ideal for this and there is no reason to kill them. You just need to build around them.<br />
What bugs me the most is the arguments against instants, most notably how they scale too far. Wizards in fact have tools to scale damage over 1 to 2 min timeframe better than any class in game. Hello, thats exactly how it should be, we are supposed to be able to do that. What is the problem. What logic in saying we should not be ahead in 2 min parses over any class. in a 5 min fight most high DPS classes are ahead of us. We do not cry about that.<br />
Prathun is a wierdo. He has no clue what he wants. He does things at the whim. He has it in for us since April. Even though situation is totaly different today he is nerfing us as if it was April 2007.<br />
There are things to like in SoF on the spell side. Hey if you take a nuke and make it cast in half the time that can only be good. WMC and CI have 0.75 sec cast time, got to love that. Problem is, you now have some of what we should have had in TSS but you don't have instants. That's no good.<br />
He simply cannot see what the freaking game is all about from a perspective of the player. Why do I have too trade nukes this way. Why don't you fucking make me happy and give me both. If you think DPS is too high lets cut the numbres down to size. There is no reason you should make me chain instants only or not be able to chain them at all. There is a very simple way to find middle ground.</div>

I've basically tuned out from the topic since the intent of the wizard nerfvamp became clear. ,to stop us from doing damage on the run.<br />
<br />
<br />
Revamp is the BS smokescreen being blown up your asses to confuse us from the fact they are acting on their sole intent, to stop us from nuking on the run. <br />
<br />
<br />
I agree a lot with what Gavrillo is saying. Instants were a lot more to me than just great dps. IT enabled me to do a lot. I can kite summoning mobs now. I can tank raid trash and actually kill it before it kills me like this.<br />
<br />
Tell me im wrong, but i havent heard anything since they clearly stated their intent to stop us from nuking on the run many months ago, that anything more than that is happening to us.</div>

There will be instants, they are still instant, they even produce much higher dps.<br />
<br />
However, depending on the rank they will have 8.5, 8.25, 8 sec recast.<br />
<br />
There is also upgrade to CBS, it shares timer with other 2 nukes, but you can chain it every 3 sec as long as you don't use other instants. Trouble is it is 1537 mana. Think about it, this is outrage, 3.6 DPM is lower than any nuke we have. It means, in almost all situations, you are better off using Manaburn. Prathun is saying I don't want you using this!!!<br />
<br />
Kiting with 8.25 recast is a joke. We are going back to snare kiting without upgraded snare.</div>

Except for the mana cost on SoF CBS I am not giving you any info thats not outthere. You can check this for yourself.<br />

You cannot kite with CBS anyway so not even an issue when it comes to kiting.<br />

Recast on Rk2 spells is 8,25. It used to be 6. You tell me, how much fun will it be to kill mobs 35% slower.</div>

		<div>I'm not really speaking specifically on the nerfs one way or the other. One thing I would like to address before that talk gets started, though, is that the changes to instants are indeed just that, nerfs. Some people have already started claiming instants weren't nerfed, &quot;they're just changed&quot;, but Prathun himself admitted as much in a letter to the community on the beta boards. <br />
<br />
What I'm referring to is more of the fact that a lot of the fundamental core of our class is being tinkered with to help compensate for abilities that neither the developer in charge of creating them nor the CC that's supposed to represent us had any foresight in designing, testing, or presenting. Whether or not you think that tinkering is detrimental or simply a &quot;change&quot; is another issue.</div>

<br />
As far as the instant nerfs, Prathun made it very clear that he DID hear our opinions on the matter -- he just didn't give a shit about them.

I have a lot of respect for Qaman, he has been our CC for many years, you have to give him due respect.<br />
<br />
For me Qaman's failure is his inability to sway Prathun on what is that wizards want. This is not about headline DPS this is about playing wizard and having fun.<br />
Qaman as I see it became Prathuns CC and not our CC. He passed Prathuns ideas and tried to sway us into accepting them.<br />
<br />
Prathun is a fickle beast, I understand that Q had to keep balance or he would not even get a response from Prathun. Thats all good, diplomacy is a subtle business but results are what matters.<br />
<br />
Prathun got what he wanted and we lost our greatest tools ever.<br />
<br />
This is why I think someone else should try.</div>
