			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Solesk mentioned in the Fallout 4 thread that he was trying to decide which Xbox One bundle to get. I remember seeing lots of deals for it and thought I would post comparisons, and figured while I was at it I might as well post PS4 and Wii U deals as well. As one preface I want to point out that I don't currently know what deals Amazon will be running. They are usually pretty competitive but it's impossible to know if they will be better or the same.<br />
<br />
Most of this will just be a summary of what I found on CAG, but because of the nature of these deals it's still taking more effort than I anticipated. I'm kind of sore with Microsoft for this. Not only do they have an absurd number of different bundles, but they have very short length deals that expire each week, which is why I couldn't find the deals I remembered hearing about. This kind of revolving door bullshit makes it hard to figure out what the best deal is, many of them have already expired, and several others expire just before the Black Friday deals go into effect. It's frustrating and a really bad holiday strategy in my opinion. It's just going to encourage people to keep waiting for the next deal. I'm not sure what the heck they were thinking.<br />
<br />
As a result I'm going to save the Xbox for last, despite it being most relevant to making this thread, simply because of how much shorter the PS4 and Wii U sections will be to read.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, the <b>Wii U</b>. I know a few of you were waiting for deals on this, not sure if you ever got one. I've been tempted myself, largely because of Xenoblade and Mario Maker. I can't decide if I should be annoyed with Nintendo for not having a better deal or not, but their only Holiday deal seems to be to get the system, Splatoon, and Smash Brothers for $250 at Target and Walmart. Bundles with other games are normally $300. So you save $50 and get two popular pack-ins instead of one. <br />
<br />
<br />
The <b>PS4</b> also has one clear bundle deal, netting you the PS4 and the Uncharted Collection (ports of the first three games) for $300. They also have a Battlefront bundle that isn't discounted at $350. So again, you save $50. This deal seems to be available everywhere. The only 1TB option is overly expensive and not getting a discount, unless Amazon or someone does a surprise Cyber Monday deal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the <b>Xbox One</b>, I'm going to start with the Black Friday deals. The best deal seems to be at Target, where you get the 500GB Gears of War bundle with a $60 gift card for $300. This is the only deal after the 21st that provides extra value equal to a free game, as most of the discounts basically amount to, you guessed it, $50 off a normal bundle's price.<br />
<br />
The different Xbox bundles seem to be retailer specific, with Best Buy and Gamespot promising $50 off any bundle. Which means you can get the 1TB Tomb Raider bundle for $350 from Best Buy, or the 1TB Holiday Bundle for $350 from Gamestop. The Holiday Bundle includes Gears of War, Ori and the Blind Forest ($20), and Rare Replay ($30), so it's similar to the cheaper Gears Bundle but with an upgrade to the hard drive as a bonus. Rare Replay is a collection of ports (30 games, maybe 12 worth playing still) and Ori is an excellent 2D platformer (though it's been heavily discounted).<br />
<br />
<br />
Now as far as the current promotions, both Target and Gamestop have a $100 trade in offer for your old system. These both expire the 21st, and while I am not certain, I imagine they require you buy the system immediately. If you are able to let that credit sit an extra week, the Target deal will be much better, though there is also the risk they sell out. Most retailers also have a free game deal that also expires on the 21st.<br />
<br />
So, while the other two platforms have pretty simple options, if you want an Xbox One you have a lot of things to consider.<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">How important is the 1TB hard drive to you? This is going to be more important to people who plan on buying a lot of games each year and want to have them all available at a moment's notice. I've yet to fill up my 500 gig PS4 yet, though people who don't mix between console and PC will fill theirs up faster. You should be able to fit at least 10 games on there without having to delete stuff.</li><li style="">Do you want to trade in your old console? It nets you an extra $50 off.</li><li style="">Which games you prefer. Do you choose based on retail savings alone, or on what you think you might rather play? This is important in choosing your free game as well. The impetus is on picking something new to get the most value, but if it isn't something you want to play it isn't going to do you much good.</li><li style="">Personally, I wouldn't worry about Kinect. While the Xbox One version is supposed to be better, it doesn't really get much support anymore. I'm not sure what on the platform is worth getting it for that you couldn't already do on the 360, and it's pretty expensive. That the Kinect version seem to be bundled with Assassin's Creed Unity seems to be one extra reason to stay away.</li></ul><br />
<br />
So, if you do trade in your old console:<br />
<br />
$250 500 Gig bundle + Free game<br />
$300 1TB bundle + Free game<br />
$400 Elite system - Only Gamestop seems to offer a free game with this one. It's very expensive but technically a good value, as the controller retails for $150 or so, and it comes with a hybrid drive.<br />
<br />
And if you don't trade in your old console:<br />
<br />
$300 500 Gig bundle + Free game (though since it's a gift card, you could get multiple cheaper games)<br />
$350 1TB bundle - no free game, though it does include a Tomb Raider bundle as an option<br />
<br />
For those that want to know all their options on the generic $50 off deal, here are all the different games featured in their two million bundles. Tomb Raider and Fallout 4 are standouts, I think. The main drawback to the 500 gig bundle isn't the size of the hard drive as much as the quality of the packaged game, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>bundled games</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
500 Gig Bundles<br />
<ul><li style="">Gears of War Ultimate (remake of the first game)</li><li style="">Lego Movie</li></ul><br />
1TB Bundles<br />
<ul><li style="">Tomb Raider</li><li style="">Fallout 4</li><li style="">Forza</li><li style="">Madden</li><li style="">Fifa</li><li style="">Holiday (Gears of War + Ori + Rare Replay)</li><li style="">Master Chief Collection (Halo 1-4 + ODST?)</li></ul><br />
$500 Bundles<br />
<ul><li style="">Halo 5</li><li style="">Elite Controller</li></ul><br />
 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
As for what free game to pick, it's kind of funny, but the most well-regarded games this year are going to suffer from the same problems you (Solesk) might have with Fallout. They were large, sprawling open-worlds. Witcher 3, Metal Gear Solid 5, etc. Tomb Raider is the obvious stand out for a relatively linear and high quality experience. Looking over what's available, I really liked Batman: Arkham Knight.<br />
<br />
If you opt for the $60 Target gift card deal, instead of getting one single game you can get multiple cheaper games, including some they have on sale during the same time period. Arkham Knight or Witcher 3 for $25, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, Battlefield Hardline, Dark Souls 2 for $20. Though this doesn't account for Tomb Raider.<br />
<br />
You are probably going to want Tomb Raider regardless of which bundle you pick, so it all boils down to different ways to save $50. Though if you are dead set on Kinect, you might not to want to trade the 360 in, as the $100 extra you will pay does not offset the $50 you save by trading it in. The 1TB is also a difference of $50.</div>

However, I absolutely love that the devs hid a scavenger hunt in the new release, and hid it from data miners by the way they went about it.  For those unfamiliar, here are the details (spoilers obv):<br />

			INTRODUCTION<br />
<br />
When The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth released last year, a super-secret character called The Lost was included, with a complex unlocking mechanism that was designed to be a community scavenger hunt. However, dataminers quickly discovered his existence by looking at the game code and he became common knowledge within a few days, to the disappointment of the game creators.<br />
<br />
With the release of the Afterbirth expansion, there was a new secret, but this one was not so easily discovered. The final reward (The Keeper) was not patched into the game until the community solved the puzzle, and many puzzle elements were not in the game at all, requiring Twitter, voice mail, and even two real-world expeditions to solve. This sort of out-of-game puzzle is more generally known as an Alternate Reality Game, or ARG.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I usually take my time with these, but I binged the heck out of this one. I thought it was pretty great. Each time they learn from the previous campaign and make the next one better. I even made my peace with the story. Either I got used to it, or they did a better job, because I actually liked it this time. Well, mostly. <br />
<br />
It's got a prologue to set things up, a campaign focusing almost exclusively on the protoss culture, and then an epilogue that ties all of the previous campaigns together. I've seen some derision regarding this last part, but I actually liked it. I was disappointed at the end of the protoss campaign that there was nothing that really matched the epic finale of the first game, but the epilogue had that in spades. It was also the only part of the entire thing I even found marginally difficult (on normal).<br />
<br />
<br />
My one major criticism is the same one I had in the previous campaigns. You get so more cool toys than ever before, but since each missions is tailored to a very specific and unique objective, often involving introducing a new unit, you don't always have much reason to use most of them. Basically there are no filler mindless &quot;kill the base, heck kill 5 bases&quot; maps, and the game could really use a few. <br />
<br />
<br />
In Wings of Liberty you had a tech tree for units and in Heart of the Swarm you had a cool evolution mechanic with wildly different zerg strains. In Legacy of the Void you have two different new systems to customize your army with. First, you get to upgrade your mothership itself with interchangeable systems based on available energy. These give you different support abilities you can call down in battle. Second, you get to customize your army layout by choosing a different faction's variant for any particular unit function. You can have Zealots with an aoe or a charge, Void Rays with a long range beam or one that splinters off and hits multiple targets, etc. You can change all of the above at any time before embarking on a mission.<br />
<br />
<br />
Minor spoilers here, but much of the game consists of uniting different Protoss factions, two of which established in Starcraft and Brood War, two which were introduced in Starcraft 2 but were never really fleshed out until now. You've got traditional Aiur units, Dark Templar units, Robotic purifiers, and what basically amount to Sith Protoss. I'm not even kidding. I dare anyone to see these guys and not immediately think the same thing. While there are all very similar units, this practically amounts to having four different possible army variations within the Protoss race itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is why it's unfortunate there isn't more space to play with them all. Though with custom maps that may change, you can't very well just take them all into skirmish maps. Luckily Blizzard added a new mode that may accomplish this. There is now a co-op mode for two players, featuring some of the kinds of mission objectives you see in single player. It wasn't clear to me what exactly this was until I saw a video of TotalBiscuit playing it. You choose a hero, so I assumed it was a hero based mode, but what choosing a hero actually does is determine what kinds of units are available to you, and which of the cooler single player upgrades you can eventually unlock.<br />
<br />
I say eventually because you have to level up your hero through playing matches. This is my one problem with the mode. It uses upgrades you would expect to get more or less by default as a carrot on the stick to keep you playing, and aside from portrait unlocks or achievements is probably the only thing to really strive for in this mode. Grinding out levels to unlock a unit or upgrade you can select at any time in a normal map is off-putting to me. Luckily I expect them to continue support for this mode by adding new heroes and new missions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my final topic. With the final campaign done, Blizzard has announced that they will continue support for the game in smaller mission packs that won't take as long to make. The first announced pack will focus on the ghost Nova. I've seen people complaining because all DLC is evil all the time, but I also remember the wait in between Starcraft 1 and Starcraft 2. Heck, the wait between these expansions was long enough. I see nothing wrong with this, even though I'm not sure three missions at a time will be that satisfying unless they plan some kind of rigid episodic schedule.<br />
<br />
I can't speak for multiplayer. It's not really something I come to these games for anymore. There is a new &quot;two-headed&quot; mode, but that's been done before. It might have been interesting to see in competitive play, but I think Dota has sort of eaten Starcraft's lunch on that front.</div>

			Just two days after Halloween, Activisions spending a whole lot of money on candythe publisher announced tonight that theyve bought Candy Crush developer King for $5.9 billion. Yes, thats BILLION.<br />
<br />
The mega-acquisition has to go through approval in Ireland, where King is based, but Activision says they anticipate that everything will be official by spring of 2016.<br />
<br />
So why is the video game publisher, best known for mammoth series like Call of Duty, spending this much money on such an unusual acquisition? Well, Candy Crush is one of the most lucrative games in the world, earning some $1.33 billion in revenue in 2014 alone according to a King financial statement. The studio, which operates Candy Crush and a number of similar games including Bubble Witch and Farm Heroes, grossed $529 million in the second quarter of 2015. Theyve also got access to a HUGE network of casual gamers that Activision can now access for all sorts of purposes.<br />
<br />
Also, as Activision points out in a press release, this gives them a pretty solid monopoly on The Biggest Brands In Gaming:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			Activision Blizzard believes that the addition of Kings highly-complementary business will position Activision Blizzard as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console and PC platforms, and positions the company for future growth. The combined company will have a world-class interactive entertainment portfolio of top-performing franchises, including two of the top five highest-grossing mobile games in the U.S. (Candy Crush Saga®, Candy Crush Soda Saga), the worlds most successful console game franchise (Call of Duty®), and the worlds most successful personal computing franchise (World of Warcraft®), as well as such well known franchises as Blizzard Entertainments Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft, StarCraft®, and Diablo® and Activision Publishings Guitar Hero®, Skylanders® and Destiny, along with over 1,000 game titles in its library.

			The combined revenues and profits solidify our position as the largest, most profitable standalone company in interactive entertainment.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This is it, the biggest month in the year for new game releases. Traditionally there are usually only a few games released this month, but each of these releases are so big that smaller games scramble to get out of their way (Call of Duty, chiefly). This year is a little different. There seem to be more juggernauts this month than usual this year.<br />
<br />
This month is so packed that awarding a single title with &quot;biggest game of the month&quot; seems like an impossible task, but I'm going to award it to <b>Fallout 4</b> all the same. We have only technically known about this game for a few months, but even the announcement alone was one of the most hotly anticipated video game events of this year. Though I do have to say that I find it tremendously amusing that there has been this group of fans that have wanted a new Fallout more than anything else, but then when it finally gets announced a bunch of naysayers start chiming in and complaining that it looks too much like Fallout 3. That's what people wanted! <br />
<br />
<br />
Also big this month, <b>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</b>. This series has had a relatively rocky road with the past few releases, but all indications seem to suggest that this one is doing everything right. This might be the first year EA ever actually beats them though, as <b>Star Wars Battlefront</b> also comes out this month. A multiplayer shooter of the most authentic looking Star Wars game to date, right at the start of new movie fever? They would have to botch this release far worse than they have ever botched anything before to mess this up, which is entirely possible. Should be a close race, regardless.<br />
<br />
Not quite on the same level, the new <b>Need for Speed</b> also comes out this month. This one is attempting to combine the various things fans liked about previous entries in the series, modding, goofy FMV, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, the Xbox gets the bigger exclusive this month, as they get early access to <b>Rise of the Tomb Raider</b>. I am personally leery of this game possibly being rushed to meet the holiday season, so would recommend waiting for impressions/reviews, but if it turns out right it should be pretty good. The PS4 meanwhile gets an expansion to <b>Bloodborne</b> titled <b>The Old Hunters</b>, and if you didn't get the original game you can get them together for less than price of the base game at launch. Good deal.<br />
<br />
Nothing huge for the Wii U this month, a new <b>Mario Tennis</b> and an Animal Crossing board game. Both the 3DS and the Wii U also get <b>Rodea the Sky Soldier</b>, which I honestly know nothing about, except that it is another one of those Japanese games that got a large swell of localization support from fans.<br />
<br />
<br />
On handhelds, the 3DS is having a pretty good month, with the biggest title arguably being <b>Yo-kai Watch</b>. This is basically Pokemon as made by Level 5 (Ni no Kuni). It's a monster rpg where you recruit various ghosts (yokai) to fill out your party. This was huge in Japan a few years ago, though I think it has died down a bit. The 3DS is also getting <b>Stella Glow</b>, a new strategy rpg from Imageepoch (sort of B tier) and a new <b>Pokemon Mystery dungeon</b>. <br />
<br />
The Vita meanwhile doesn't seem to be getting any significant new releases, unless you are a fan of Sword Art Online or live in Europe, in which case you finally get access to Persona 4 Dancing All Night, though I suspect fans probably just imported it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the Protoss campaign of <b>Starcraft 2</b> finally comes out on PC this month. All of you waiting for the inevitable battlechest are one step closer to getting all three campaigns in one package. :p If you want to scratch a different kind of strategy itch, the latest <b>Anno</b> game is also supposed to come out this month.<br />
<br />
Edit: I have a correction. Apparently Blizzard is already bundling all three Starcraft campaigns for $60 if you buy it through Battlenet.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Microsoft had a big Gamescom showing this year, whereas Sony did not. While my assumption was they would save all their post E3 announcements for their own event they hold in December, it turns out they decided to have a press event at Paris Games Week as well. I went into this not expecting much at all, but it actually ended up being a pretty packed show. Much like the Microsoft briefing, I'm going to try to just focus on the highlights and gloss over the smaller stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
The big new announcement was a new game from Quantic Dream, the makers of Heavy Rain. The new game is titled Detroid: Become Human, and is an evolution of a tech demo they created years ago about an android named Kara that had become sentient and didn't want to die. <br />
<br />
They also had a big gameplay demonstration of the previously announced Wild from Michel Ancel. In what they showed, you play as a shaman who communes with wildlife in order to accomplish your goals.<br />
<br />
They showed a slightly more in depth presentation of the Horizon Zero Dawn gameplay shown at E3, as well as a more in depth look at Media Molecule's weird &quot;Dreams&quot; game. They also announced a new Gran Turismo, as well as a few smaller titles.<br />
<br />
They had a big focus on promoting their upcoming Virtual Reality system, either showing or announcing support for several games, including an Until Dawn spinoff, Gran Turismo, Battlezone, etc.<br />
<br />
They showed trailers for, or talked about, a ridiculous number of games, so I'm not going to list them all. Here are a few examples: Bloodborne expansion, Uncharted multiplayer, Tekken 7, Battlefront,  No Man's Sky, Gravity Rush 2 (previously announced at Tokyo Game show), etc.</div>
