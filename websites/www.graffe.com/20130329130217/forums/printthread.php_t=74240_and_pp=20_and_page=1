		<blockquote class="restore">Decide what I should get my masters in. Alternatively, fill submit an alternative.  Control Syste,s should be Control Systems in the poll.  I am leaning toward Signal Analysis.  Power possibly has greater utility though.  Control Systems is cool too though.  ML/Pattern Recognition is fun, and what I have the most experience in but having a EE degree is basically pointless and uses little of the degree material, even the math learned.  It's heavy on statistics/probability which is only lightly used directly, although it does show up in signal analysis too (stats/probability that is).  Another reason that I am really considering changing focuses is that the number of different backgrounds applicable to ML is much higher, so job exclusivity is non-existent.  With ML I am competing against math majors who focused on statistics, CS people, EE, and some other backgrounds I am overlooking.  While there is great demand for this skill now, potentially a great deal of the demand originates in what is solvable problems that would be handed off to significantly less specialized people in the future.  I really enjoy it and think it is cool as hell, but it is really aggravating to have gone through hell, putting in 100-120 hour work weeks nonstop getting my BSEE and extracurriculars (undergraduate research etc.), and then not using any of it really aside from some skills picked up in solving shit tons of design problems etc.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">Power is a field that needs engineers so badly it's starting to die.<br />
<br />
It's also &quot;easy&quot; - lots of rule-of-thumb measurements, guesstimations, and big picture ideas when interacting with the People With Money.<br />
<br />
It cannot be outsourced (effectively).<br />
<br />
No matter the political condition of the country, or the stability, the skills and knowledge of this industry will be a requirement. Furthermore, it's very easily transferred to any modernized country in the world.<br />
<br />
If you have any aptitude or interest in Power, Power Electronics, Power Engineering, Grid and Power Distribution, or anything related to those fields, I *strongly* recommend this selection.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">That is what I am thinking as well Yttrium since I plan on emigrating elsewhere after I finish my masters.  I found all of my power courses extremely boring though is the thing.  I am concerned that I would have to live near power plants too in order to avoid a long drive, and due to NIMBY behavior the locations would likely be less than sensational, however in a country with decent mass transport living farther away may not be too terrible.  One thing I will miss about the US is how lax gun and knife laws are.  Being a full on redneck is readily accessible and the citizens don't have a negative connotation with ownership or usage.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">If you work in Power Generation, then adjacency to a station would be a bonus. Otherwise, no. One of the top Power Electronics manufacturers in the US, in fact, has a *huge* development shop in Boerne, TX. Yep, someplace you've never heard of, and has no power generation near it.<br />
<br />
Grid Supervision/Design/Maintenance is typically located near centers of political or legislative power - much like ERCOT is headquartered in Austin, with key stations in D/FW, Houston, and somewhere down south in the state.</blockquote>
