Hmm, I'd like to see a &quot;reverse&quot; exodus.  You would pop your group back to the spot you just exodussed from.  If you you zone you lose the ability to do this.  Make it a long reuse AA, with some AA to shorten the recast timer.</div>

Reverse proc.  Cast on the mob.  When it procs off of &quot;defensives&quot; it deals the mob some proc dmg.<br />

Being it could be triggered like the defensive proc buffs rangers/clerics/druids get, except it hurts the mob its casted on, like a debuff.  I'm sure they could also limit the number of procs if they wanted to.</div>

I actually didn't mean it in percetage. :)<br />
<br />
E.g.: Firebane uses a resist adjustment of -300. Add to this the -100 of Prismatic Focus and you have an adjustment of -400 which would be around 30%<br />
<br />
The idea was focussed around our big nukes. We all love it if you cast Ether Flame and get resisted on it or same for ACF or Corona Flare (whichever you use). Our big nukes all have only a resist adjustment of -10. Even if you add to this -50 from Pyromancy you only have a resist adjustment of -60 (add to this the Flux staff for -72 if you are keen).<br />
<br />
As our DPS comes only from nukes (pets can be neglected mostly), every partially or fully resisted nuke lowers our DPS significantly. Having a resist adjustment of -110 (or -160 with Pyromancy) would at least help us in this department. However it wouldn't affect the ingame implemented mob resists too widely aka if a mob is very resistant to fire your best choice would still be to use another nuke type or lures.<br />
<br />
Not saying this should be implemented like this but fact is that our resist adjustments definitely need work/improvement.<br />

All kidding aside and yes I do like that idea not for FF7 sakes, but pretty much looking for is-<br />
<br />
Upgrade to Harvest of Druzzil whether spell or AA<br />
<br />
Mass punt to wizard's direction of choice, maybe like give us MGB except it would be MGT (Mass Group Teleport) as an AA.  Click that and say click group portal to Wall of Slaughter and everyone in range will get the option to take an X-loc to there.<br />
<br />
Maybe an Aura (Not a Trap) that would benefit the groups damage output.  Can be based off the number of people in the group the % of their direct damage spells goes higher.<br />
<br />
Wizard by himself 5% increase to all direct spell damage. <br />
Wizard with 1 other in group 7% increase to all direct spell damage<br />
Wizard with 2 other in group 9% increase to all direct spell damage<br />
Wizard with 3 other in group 11% increase to all direct spell damage<br />
Wizard with 4 other in group 13% increase to all direct spell damage<br />
Wizard with 5 other in group 15% increase to all direct spell damage<br />
<br />
Just the random one's I can think of off hand I would like to see in game.<br />

		<div>just want to be able to compeat with rogues dpswise like we should be doing and im happy<br />
<br />
whatever the case 5 things i hope they consider<br />
1) is giving casters good aa, melees get lot of good dps aa but the main thing casters get is just mana regen and crits<br />
2) like a -40cr/fr debuff clicky aa or spell, cant expect every trash mob for us to be debuffed for us<br />
3) how about reducing mana cost on some of our spell lines instead of increasing mana cost even more! im not looking forward to 1k mana nukes with only 15 mana regen hehe. <br />
4) on our sustained line, i shouldnt be losing mana casting that stuff. would be nice if there were like either a proc or aa that gives them a chance to be free <br />
5) time for a clarity spell(mages too so all caster get one), i think we just way to dependant on mana regen buffs</div>

		<div>kinda a rehash--<br />
<br />
Translocate Bind: TL's target to your bind. (please, for our sanity, make it shardless, just like tl's should be...)<br />
<br />
and one further thought--<br />
<br />
We absolutely need some kind of boost in sustained dps. Every time I nuke, it feels like I'm typing '/rand 90' (or whatever my current focus amount is) to see what I'd land on a nuke... (this's before the initial and secondary resist checks, of course, further hampering my chances).<br />

Haha, I love that.<br />
<br />
Here is what I would like to see most, and yes, most of it has already been mentioned, so I'm just adding agreement.<br />
<br />
1) Improve our harvest spell and AA to be a percentage of total mana pool. Perhaps 20% for the spell and 40% for the AA.<br />
<br />
2) Mass Teleport. I see no reason why this shouldn't be implemented.<br />
<br />
3) Adjustments to our resist factors on all spells. Since we rely 100% on our spells and are supposedly the Masters of Direct Damage, you would think that we would be better at getting our spells to land. Nothing is worse than spending 5 seconds and 1k'ish mana on a big spell that gets resisted while the melee classes poke, hack and slash away. Standard resist adjustment is -10 when it should really be more like -45.  Even with -50 from pyro and -12 from clicky staff thats -107...not at all unreasonable. Even an AA line that would improve our resist adjustments significantly would be awesome.</div>

I think its a first time that we have been proactive in actually posting what we want and or expect from the new expansion... I hope it was not too late to post over 4 months ago on this topic and that some of our ideas actually made it in, seems in some cases a lot of us share the same ideas. /cross fingers~</div>

		<div>if we're still bumping the thread in hopes of aa's, then here's a few which would be nice to have<br />
<br />
Chromatic Familiar (I know, been said alot, but I'm just mentioning it again :p )<br />
Mass TL to anywhere we can tl<br />
<br />
those have been said alot, but the following idea, I don't ever remember seeing anyone mention:<br />
I would like an aa which would increase our minimum damage for the focuses that we have. For instance, Improved Damage 5 (will there be ID6 now?) has a random 1-20% imp dmg but it would be nice to have an aa with 5 levels that would increase the minimum damage for the focus.<br />
<br />
imp dmg 5, 6, whatever it gets to<br />
lvl 1 - 4-20%<br />
lvl 2 - 8-20%<br />
lvl 3 - 12-20%<br />
lvl 4 - 16-20%<br />
lvl 5 - 20%<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even mind if there were 3 different types of this aa to provide for each of our 3 different spell types, I just think it would be an awesome idea and would boost our dps a little over what it is currently and it definately wouldn't break the game.</div>

Really? I'd like to find the old threads if you can dig them up Qaman... <br />
would be interesting to see what was requested prior and what has actually been Implemented... <br />
Usually from what I've seen it ends up a gripe and moan session when we get stuck with Devs ideas of what spells or AA's are good for us, Instead of just listening to the people that spend about 40 hours or more a week playing the class.</div>
