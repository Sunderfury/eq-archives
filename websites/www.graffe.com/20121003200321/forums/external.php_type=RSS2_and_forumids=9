			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I work until 1-2 AM at a crummy job to provide the single income that supports my family.  My wife has serious health problems and I asked her a few years back to stop working as her health was suffering. About once a week I walk about 6 miles home from work.  The hour is certainly odd but I don't live in an area where I fear for my safety and its healthy and clears my head. <br />
<br />
Regularly the local police harass me for no particular reason.  I have no record of any kind.  As in not even a ticket...ever.  I do not look like a gangster or a criminal.   <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=1888&amp;d=1348928576"  title="Name:  michaelnov2011web.jpg

Size:  93.8 KB">michaelnov2011web.jpg</a><br />
<br />
I have been threatened, I have been disrespected, I have been asked to show a baggy in my pocket because all the hip drug dealers keep their stash in jack links teriyaki bags because that tangy flavor smokes so damn smooth.  I have been told they were concerned for my safety because I didn't have a coat. I have been questioned repeatedly, patted down with my hands on the freaking car, had my nonexistent record run repeatedly at their convenience.   I have been threatened with arrest not once but twice while helping someone more their property from their apartment.  Once made to wait an hour because they wanted to verify that the resident who had committed the grievous sin of being born with dark skin wasn't robbing the place despite his id showing residence and his mail being in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
As I was leaving the latest shakedown I used the f word while turning to walk away.  I was subsequently arrested for public disorderly conduct based entirely on the content of my speech.  It is illegal in the state of South Carolina to use profanity on the public road.   Yes really.  The officer assured me it was the content of my speech which was illegal.  Further that &quot;The first amendment doesn't mean you can say whatever you want.&quot;  Her further cited the fact that an employer can fire you for making racist statements as an example that free speech doesn't guarantee well free speech.  The distinction between a private employment agreement and the law of the land was entirely lost on him unfortunately because apparently we don't teach that in the south.<br />
<br />
So I was kidnapped and tossed in with a bunch of drug addicts and drunks including one fellow who got arrested for being drunk in his own back yard and hadn't been able to reach anyone on the phone for 3 days.  He spent the entire time crumpling his paperwork and smoothing it out.  Not the most exciting social environment there.<br />
<br />
I was unable to contact anyone for like 8 hours.  I told the cops there that I needed to call my wife because if I disappeared in the middle of the night she would think I was dead.  I got... laughter.  Then one of the dicks came over and I thought he was going to give me my phone call unfortunately he had just realized by watching me waving that he had forgotten to confiscate my wedding ring... Gee thanks asshole.  Not only this but when my wife started calling ERs and police stations she was lied to and told I wasn't there.<br />
<br />
When I got out of web cam court, yes really, I was given my cell phone and could finally reach her.  She had spent the entire morning crying thinking I was dead.<br />
<br />
Now I have to deal with a court case in which I face a $270 fine that I can pay but would really like to put towards something like a FUCKING bill and a threat of prosecuting me for having in my possession a entirely legal prescription drug based on the fact that I chose to carry a single pill in a key chain container from a local pharmacy rather than strolling around with the entire bottle.<br />
<br />
I fucking love living in the land of the free and the home of the brave.  Is fucking cursing on the fucking internet fucking illegal yet?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I recall the halcyon days of rpg gaming.<br />
<br />
The times when we all got force-fed bullshit and loved it because there were few options available.<br />
<br />
We sucked it up, chowed down heartily, and then requested more, while forcefully complaining that our games or expansions tasted like someone had deposited a corn-filled present in our feedbag of blue porta potty water.<br />
<br />
They were bleak days.<br />
<br />
Enter the modern era and Kings of Amalur.<br />
<br />
The single player and multi-player RPG as a genre has achieved some levels of success and it is PROFITABLE.<br />
<br />
It's the right time to make a storied RPG game.<br />
<br />
The audience is larger.<br />
<br />
Advancements in gameplay and interfaces have been made.<br />
<br />
AND YET KOA IS DETERMINED TO INSIST THAT I CLICK A DIALOG BOX AT EVERY FUCKING STEP, AND MOST TIMES AT LEAST TWICE.<br />
<br />
That's bad enough from an interface standpoint, but what the fuck ever happened to roleplaying games being INTERACTIVE?!<br />
<br />
Why am I WATCHING dialogue instead of participating in it?<br />
<br />
I'm not shelling out my hard-earned money and valuable time to watch a movie, I'm spending my precious commodities playing a video game...or at least I thought I was...instead I'm just watching developer masturbation.<br />
<br />
Who the FUCK thought this level of bullcrap was a good idea?<br />
<br />
It's like meeting jockeys multiplied by a side order of groupthink.<br />
<br />
Fuck your company.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that so many people got shafted as a result of the breakdown, but if that was the level of in-the-box thinking that was going on, someone should have voiced some concern from the player's perspective or perhaps from the QA standpoint.<br />
<br />
Protip - QA works better without fanbois on board and interface design is far more key than voiceovers and cutscenes are.<br />
<br />
People who play games want to PLAY them, not WATCH them.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Firstly you can't take the test in linux as you must run &quot;Repondus Lockdown Browser&quot; to take the test.  This prevents you from opening another tab and googling the answer.   This is a great anti cheating tool so long as students don't have textbooks, phones, or friends.  Actually searching the internet wouldn't help anyway because the answers to the questions are randomly pulled out of someones asshole.  You might actually have a better chance of cheating with a ouija board or a set of dice.  Try this one on for size motherfuckers<br />
<br />
1) The answer to the next question will be decided by<br />
<br />
A) The result of a dice roll<br />
B) generator.nextInt( n );<br />
C) The cup size of the last chick I slept with<br />
D) The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mechanical turk</a><br />
<br />
Out of the last exam 7 out of 50 questions were dead wrong.  Ex.  An example of safe computing: Right answer C: telnet NO NO NO NO<br />
<br />
The goddamn book describes telnet as &quot;an internal threat&quot; to secure computing bitches!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I was excited that they were releasing the street fighter games on pc during the summer sale on steam. I'd pirated a previous version once before and it worked somewhat well on my lackluster pc that met the minimum requirements. The listed requirements for the purchased version were mostly similar and well within range.<br />
<br />
I have very fond memories of growing up and trading controllers with my friends on the neighborhood super nintendo so we could invent new ways of doing things in street figther 2. Then again in turbo edition<br />
<br />
<br />
Not so this load of extra installs and verification.<br />
<br />
I spent my scant monetary allowance on your repeated susurrant promises and you gave me windows live and so many reboots that I'm not sure whether you're speaking honestly or just faking it for the sake of the audience.<br />
<br />
I really despise spending money on duds that I don't have tha ability to fix up easily.<br />
It's a betrayal of bank.</div>
