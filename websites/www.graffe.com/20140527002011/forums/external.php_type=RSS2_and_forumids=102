			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Back in July after my office moved, our DNS settings changed internally.<br />
Now instead of pulling our DNS from a local(on-site) server, we get it from a globally sourced block of DNS information based on region.<br />
It's supposed to allow for failover and redundancy but thus far I haven't noticed any positive gains.<br />
<br />
In December, 95% of my office (~25 people) got all new laptops.<br />
Most of those people now alternate telecommuting and car commuting.<br />
<br />
When most of those people get into the office after having worked from home, they have the most bizarre problem:<br />
<br />
All of the network drives that point to local servers will not connect.<br />
You cannot ping those servers via domain name or IP address.<br />
You can get external and internal internet sources but going to any local server won't work.<br />
Outlook works, which makes sense because the Outlook servers are non-local.<br />
<br />
In about half of the cases, simply waiting 10-15 minutes allows the drives to &quot;connect silently&quot; and they spontaneously start working.<br />
<br />
Thus far I have had three different troubleshooting paths:<br />
1 - Reboot.  This'll usually work.<br />
2 - Run CMD - ipconfig /release /flushdns /renew  (without flushdns it won't work.)  This works in about a third of the remaining cases.  (I've created a batch file for this.)<br />
3 - Remap the drives.  This works in about a third of the remaining cases.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't work at all, you simply need to wait.<br />
<br />
With Dale's assistance I was able to cobble together a batch file that will remap the drives of the users.<br />
Unfortunately due to the fact that, try as I did when we undertook the server move in July, there is no longer any standardization on the drive mappings due to the respective needs of each department.  This means that a single catch-all batch file won't work.<br />
I've started the process of making custom batch files for each user.  This isn't too bad, as there's only ~40 people to worry about.<br />
<br />
However the development manager got into his head that we should be using Powershell for this.<br />
While I am aware of the PS commands to map a drive (in PS and persistently in Windows) I've not been able to figure out a way to have PS grab the paths and drive IDs for the existing mappings, store them as variables, kill the existing drive mappings, then remap using the stored information.<br />
<br />
<b>**tl/dr** Is there a way to use Powershell to:<br />
1 - Grab the drive letters and UNC paths of existing drives<br />
2 - Kill the existing drive letters<br />
3 - Remap (persistently) those drive letters using the stored UNC paths<br />
4 - Profit ... ?</b><br />
<br />
Thanks</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Not a tech support request, more of a hobby house thing just technical.  Probably only MI will read this, if that :P <br />
<br />
I'm migrating to using <a href="http://www.yaml.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">yaml</a> whenever I want to write something down in a data structure that will be parsed be a computer program, and may wind up being too complex for standard &quot;key = value&quot; formats like ini, and a spreadsheet format isn't what I want either.  For example, a list of monsters and attributes for an RPG.<br />
<br />
Essentially:  <br />
<br />
XML is meant for <i>documents</i>, not data or configuration.  It's verbose and complex to parse.<br />
<br />
INI and similar formats lack support for lists, trees, dictionaries, and other advanced/nested data structures.<br />
<br />
CSV, like INI, doesn't directly support nested data structures.<br />
<br />
Lisp is mostly only used by people writing lisp.<br />
<br />
JSON is meant as a data interchange format and offers no &quot;human writing&quot; advantages over native code.  JSON is so bare-bones it doesn't even support comments.<br />
<br />
YAML solves the same problems as JSON, but its grammar is substantially more complex and the result is a format that is far more easy to write than JSON, while still being about as easy to parse.  Yaml also has some (admittedly ugly) support for some non-standard data structures like the Python &quot;tuple.&quot;  The main tradeoff of yaml compared to JSON is that there can be multiple ways to specify the same thing, and it's easier to accidentally write valid yaml that doesn't mean what you thought it meant (for example, getting a nested list when you expected a single list).  That also means automatically generated yaml might not look the same as equivalent yaml you would write yourself.</div>
