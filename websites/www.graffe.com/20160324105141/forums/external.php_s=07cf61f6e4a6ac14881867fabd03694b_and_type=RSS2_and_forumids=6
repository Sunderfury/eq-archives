			ROCHESTER, M.N. - The man serving a life sentence in the January 2011 shooting in Tucson that killed six and injured many others, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, has filed a $25 million lawsuit against her.<br />
<br />
Jared Loughner seeks $25 million in punitive damages against Giffords for &quot;causing me emotion and psychological distress,&quot; according to the March 18 filing .<br />
 <br />
&quot;My incarceration is illegal. I am actually innocent. I was Framed. I am a victim of project mk-ultra the govt. put a chip in my head to control my mind,&quot; Loughner claims.<br />
<br />
Note: Capitalizations, abbreviations, spelling and grammatical errors are reflective of the documents filed.<br />
<br />
Among Loughner's more outlandish claims:<br />
<div style="margin-left:40px">• Giffords is part of the Illuminati<br />
• She &quot;never got shot, it was all an act,&quot; she learned from watching Ronald Reagan movies<br />
• He's become &quot;sick and delusional&quot; from chemtrails in the sky<br />
• He was &quot;handpicked illegally to be a sleeper assassin&quot;<br />
• He's waterboarded everyday by the NSA, CIA, ATF on Gifford's orders<br />
• She set up &quot;poor man&quot; Cliven Bundy and &quot;infiltrated&quot; the ranch<br />
• She financed the shooters in the deadly San Bernardino shooting<br />
• His attorney framed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the man convicted in the Boston Marathon bombings<br />
• He does not get access to NPR or CSPAN</div><br />

<br />
Now, this article seems to get a few things wrong, because &quot;secret&quot; (L), &quot;top secret&quot; (Q) are DRASTICALLY different levels of clearance, and an SCIF is it's own thing entirely. (My uncle had Q and worked in an SCIF in TN back in the 80's.)<br />
<br />
Now, granted, a whole bunch of REALLY stupid shit makes it to &quot;Top Secret&quot; if my Uncle's similes are to be believed. (&quot;The cookies are free for everyone in the sector regardless of clearance, but revealing the non-stick enamel formula used to coat the pan they were cooked on is treasonable&quot; was one of his comparisons) and it can't be easy to vet new hardware, but I still found this article hilarious.<br />
<br />
I also love that this thing has &quot;classified&quot; and &quot;unclassified&quot; keys and ports.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain why there shouldn't just be buttons and ports for &quot;classified&quot; mode and everything gets used that way?<br />

<br />
The Sectéra Edge may not win many beauty pageants, but the Windows CE device is certified by the NSA for &quot;top secret&quot; use.<br />
<br />
Newly released documents under the Freedom of Information Act show that Hillary Clinton, then-secretary of state had asked the National Security Agency to supply her with the same modified, strengthened BlackBerry used by President Barack Obama.<br />
<br />
The request was eventually denied, citing security concerns as the intelligence agency was trying to cut down on the rise in BlackBerry users across the State Department.<br />
<br />
But because parts of Clinton's department was designated a sensitive compartmentalized facility (SCIF), an enclosed area used to prevent external eavesdropping, government policy prevented the secretary and her staff from using uncleared cellular devices.<br />
<br />
The nearest &quot;BlackBerry-like&quot; solution supported by the NSA at the time was costly -- each device would cost the government about $4,750 and the secure server infrastructure (and associated costs) would add another $30,000 to the bill. But the phone itself wasn't very &quot;BlackBerry-like&quot; in design or ease-of-use, according to the State Department's security director at the time.<br />
<br />
That's when Clinton sought her own BlackBerry, and where her troubles started.<br />
<br />
Since then, the former senior Obama administration official and now Democratic presidential frontrunner has been embroiled in a row over the use of a private email server. Critics have accused her of skirting government archiving and transparency laws.<br />
<br />
But the affair may have been avoided had the former cabinet official used the NSA's alternative: the Sectéra Edge, a clunky, heavy smartphone powered by a long-discontinued operating system.<br />
<br />

<br />
The Edge is a part-phone, part-PDA that was certified by the NSA to be used with highly-classified materials, including internal network access and sending and receiving emails.<br />
<br />
Running a version of Windows CE, first introduced in 1996, the so-called &quot;secure mobile environment portable electronic device&quot; probably closer resembled the Windows desktops hard-wired in the State Department's secure rooms than a BlackBerry -- let alone the BlackBerry 8830 used by the president.<br />
<br />
According to a profile of the device by sister-site CNET some years ago, the NSA claims the installed versions of Internet Explorer, WordPad, and Windows Messenger are strong enough for &quot;secret&quot; levels and below.<br />
<br />
Aside from its security features, the phone-PDA is shock-proof and drop-resistant.<br />
<br />
The Edge was discontinued in 2015.

			Arizona’s primaries aren’t even done yet, and there’s already legal action being taken as a result of incompetence or possibly even intentional sabotage.<br />
<br />
Leaders from the Arizona branch of the Democratic Party have confirmed that its lawyers are officially making an inquiry after multiple Democratic voters showed up to the polls only to find that they were listed as independents, Republicans, or had no party affiliation at all.<br />
<br />
Many voters wound up having to wait in line under the hot Arizona sun only to find that they were ineligible to vote for the candidates of their choice. To add insult to injury, the polling locations have been so poorly planned that many voters had to wait in line up to four hours before finding out that their information had been improperly filed.

Twitter is alight, but that's not a surprise being that it's twitter, so I imagine it's being blown SOMEWHAT out of proportion.<br />

The Minnesota caucuses were somewhat fucked on the democratic side in the twin cities area, this sounds like it could be worse.<br />

			A 6-year-old girl who spent most of her life with California foster parents was removed from her home on Monday under a court order that concluded her Native American blood requires her placement with relatives in Utah.<br />
<br />
Lexi, who is part Choctaw, cried and clutched a stuffed bear as Rusty Page carried her out of his home north of Los Angeles to a waiting car. Los Angeles County social workers whisked her away.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is it that a screaming child, saying 'I want to stay, I'm scared,' how is in her best interest to pull her from the girl she was before that doorbell rang?&quot; he told KNX-AM radio.<br />
<br />
His wife, Summer Page, screamed &quot;Lexi, I love you!&quot; and a crowd of friends and neighbors cried, prayed or sang hymns.<br />
<br />
The Pages had fought efforts under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act to place Lexi with relatives of her father, who is a Native American. The Pages argued that Lexi had lived with them since the age of 2 and knew no other life.<br />
<br />
However, a court found that the Page family &quot;had not proven by clear and convincing evidence that it was a certainty the child would suffer emotional harm by the transfer.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Pages have three children and want to adopt Lexi. The family is appealing and will go to the California Supreme Court if necessary, said their attorney, Lori Alvino McGill.<br />
<br />
Lexi was 17 months old when she was removed from her birth parents' custody. Her mother had substance abuse problems, and her father had an extensive criminal history, according to court records cited by the Los Angeles Daily News (<a href="http://bit.ly/1pYtXlg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/1pYtXlg</a>).<br />
<br />
She will live with a Utah couple who are not Native Americans but are related by marriage to her father. The girl's sister is living with the couple, and another sister will be living down the street, said Leslie Heimov of the Children's Law Center of California, Lexi's court-appointed legal representatives.<br />
<br />
&quot;The law is very clear that siblings should be kept together whenever they can be, and they should be placed together even if they were not initially together,&quot; Heimov told the Daily News.<br />
<br />
She said the girl and the Utah family had traded messages and monthly visits over the past three years.<br />
<br />
&quot;She has a loving relationship with them,&quot; Heimov said. &quot;They are not strangers in any way, shape or form.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a statement, the National Indian Child Welfare Association said the Pages were aware for years that the girl was an American Indian but chose to &quot;drag out litigation as long as possible, creating instability for the child.&quot;<br />
<br />
In a statement, the Choctaw Nation said it &quot;desires the best for this Choctaw child.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The tribe's values of faith, family and culture are what makes our tribal identity so important to us. Therefore we will continue to work to maintain these values and work toward the long-term best interest of this child,&quot; the statement said.

			<b>DETROIT -- A man who police say told investigators that &quot;a devil figure&quot; on Uber's app was controlling him when he allegedly killed six people in western Michigan is suing the ride-sharing company.</b><br />
<br />
In his handwritten complaint filed Tuesday, Jason Dalton does not mention the shootings directly, but said: &quot;I am currently in prison because of Uber.&quot; Dalton is accused of fatally shooting six people and wounding two others between picking up passengers for Uber in Kalamazoo on Feb. 20.<br />
<br />
In his lawsuit, Dalton seeks $10 million from Uber. He claims that the company &quot;ripped&quot; him off and failed to pay him back wages and overtime. The 1½-page lawsuit was mailed to the U.S. District Court in Detroit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I busted my butt for them,&quot; Dalton wrote. &quot;They gave me no Christmas bonus, I wasn't invited to any corporate parties, they made me work when I was sick and didn't let me spend time with my two children.&quot;<br />
<br />
He continued: &quot;My life is ruined because of Uber. My wife is divorcing me because of Uber.&quot;<br />
<br />
The company said Dalton started working for Uber earlier this year.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's hard to know how to respond to someone who refuses to take responsibility for his own actions,&quot; Uber said in a statement emailed to CBS News Wednesday. &quot;Our hearts go out to the victims' families who have to live with the consequences of his terrible crimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalton is charged with murder and attempted murder in the shootings at three separate locations. He has been ordered to undergo a mental competency exam, CBS affiliate WWJ reported.<br />
<br />
According to documents police released Monday, Dalton told investigators that when he opened the Uber app, &quot;a devil head popped up on his screen and when he pressed the button on the app, that is when all the problems started.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dalton told authorities after the shootings that &quot;it feels like it is coming from the phone itself&quot; and told of something &quot;like an artificial presence,&quot; the police report said, according to WWJ.<br />
<br />
Dalton told officers that when you &quot;plug into&quot; the Uber app, &quot;you can actually feel the presence on you.&quot; He said the difference between the night of the shootings and others was that an icon on the Uber app that is normally red &quot;had changed to black.&quot;<br />
<br />
He told investigators he &quot;doesn't want to come across as a crazy person,&quot; and added he was sad for the people who were killed as well as for his family members, who &quot;are going to have to hear all of this,&quot; according to the report.<br />
<br />
Dalton's attorney has not responded to requests for comment on his client's behalf.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I realize this is a rant, but this is a direct result of our political debate.<br />
<br />
But seriously, fuck this country and fuck the republicans.<br />
<br />
I'm self employed, my wife is self employed.  Because of this we have health insurance through the health exchange (in Ohio).  I'm already mad enough that our monthly premium is $440 for a family of 4, which is outrageous.  Anytime I hear someone speak out against universal health coverage I just want to punch them in their face.  And I don't understand why people are so willing to pay so much money for such crappy coverage.<br />
<br />
Despite all this I was in a good mood because my step daughter recently got married and we were taking her off our plan.  So I think great, I can save a little money.<br />
<br />
Boy was I wrong.  Our plan went UP $130 to remove the most expensive person on the plan (she has severe asthma and mental issues).  So now they want me to pay $570 or something a month to insure 3 whole people.<br />
<br />
On top of that I have very little power to fight any of it.  Hell, I can't even talk to anyone that can make a decision.  The health insurance company won't talk to me directly about policy changes.  They direct you to the health exchange.  The health exchange has no say or control over pricing though, they just tell you what the companies are quoting them.<br />
<br />
It's a circle jerk designed to strip me of any power.  They said my only recourse is to search for a different plan or file an appeal that takes 90 days.<br />
<br />
And all of this for coverage that is crappy at best, my wife was even denied a biopsy the doctor wanted to do last month.  <b>A procedure requested by a medical specialist was denied by the insurance company</b>.  If we were told 10 years ago that our premiums would skyrocket up, our copays would skyrocket up and fewer things would be covered people would have lost their minds.  But somehow we're still here and most of this country seems fine with it.<br />
<br />
Health insurance for profit is the worst idea this country has ever had.  And the republicans have ensured that the free market is so hands off we see a negative economic benefit to it.  My own dad hates the idea of everyone in this country having health insurance, even though he knows his own son would be without it if republicans had their way.<br />

So basically I just had a conversation that ended with me threatening to murder the manager.  And honestly I'm even more pissed that Bernie isn't getting elected now.  I'm also mad that Obama pussied out when he had the chance.</div>

<br />
But the pics I just got from my cardiologist are just too cool not to share, heh.  I find them pretty amazing at least.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, I had a heart attack February 25th.  Heart disease is rampant on my father's side of the family, and because of this our family doctor was constantly checking for indicators and warning signs with me, and none ever presented themselves.  :(<br />
<br />
My blood pressure has always been perfect, my cholesterol levels have always been normal, I'm in good health otherwise, lift weights 3 times per week.  So it came as a complete shock.  I was in complete denial.  In the E.R. I was telling them they need to double check because I've struggled with acid reflux most of my life and I was certain it was a symptom of that, not a heart attack.  But it was, almost a complete blockage of my left circumflex artery.<br />
<br />
They shot me up with some kind of dye to visually inspect the blockage, and then installed a catheter in my right wrist and reached the blockage that way and placed a stent.  I was up and walking later that afternoon.  They placed me on a bunch of meds to lower blood pressure, thin the blood, and help with cholesterol.  They've reduced some of them today on my follow up appointment, where I also got these cool pics lol.  Before the placement of the stent:<br />

I turn 47 in April by the way.  The cardiologist cleared me to return to work the first week of April, with zero restrictions.  -Said I could start lifting again in 2 months, lower weight and higher reps.  I haven't had a cigarette since it happened, and I'm on a low sodium / low cholesterol diet now which I think I'm struggling with more than the smoking, heh.<br />
<br />
This kind of served as a wake up call I think to alot of friends, colleagues and family who've been asking lots of questions.  I'm certainly willing to answer any here if any have any.<br />
<br />
And if any here have gone through stuff like this I'd be curious to hear about it.  I wouldn't turn down any mojo sent my way either.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have what I think are a mix of difficult through god level difficulty searches/research recon challenges.<br />
<hr />a) I remember reading some time ago, maybe a year or two ago, that modern hosiery/silk socks sucks and get runners etc. easily, which wearing women's knee highs (come up below the calf for me more or less as a man with big feet compared to most women [1]) I can confirm regardless of brand as being true. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER, it is claimed that in the 1970s that such hosiery for whatever reason was effectively indestructible and was extremely resistant towards developing runners and essentially never happened on its own, some effort such as being caught on a corner had to happen for them to tear.<br />
<br />
Mission: find out what the difference between modern textiles/sewing stich used results in this change. Phrased another way, determine what 1970s hosiery was made out with respect to material used and also what stich technique was commonly used for those.<br />
<br />
These two reddit threads may provide inspiration for whatever invocation you discover: <br />
<br />
i) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/2oqz8r/what_brands_of_pantyhose_have_you_found_to_keep/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashi...found_to_keep/</a><br />

<br />
Bonus Mission: locate some vendor who still makes hosiery that way, ideally for socks. Etsy and similar vendor sites are acceptable. <br />
<hr />b) find some combination of search terms and special operators to locate the c-- home page WITHOUT using c minus minus instead. Google does not index the token &quot;--&quot; so it interpets that search as a search for the C programming language. Restrictions: you cannot use c minus minus and you cannot restrict the search to a web page that you know only refers to c minus minus utilizing the site: or in: or inurl: operators or some equivalent I am unaware of. <i><b>Solved By Fyrie</b></i><br />
<hr />c) find a search engine which does not try and be clever about interpeting search terms by automagically also searching for similar words at the same time or automagically correcting my search term if it is spelled incorrectly according to the automagical algorithm the search engine uses. It is acceptable if there is simply some way to tell the search engine to not do this rather than the search engine always not being clever.<br />
<hr />d) Find a search engine which has reverse video search capabilities and still exists rather than being vaporware or dissolved. This may not exist.<br />
<hr />d) Find a search engine which is competent at subimage searching rather than just searching for the full image. The search enginne should realize that subsection of the image refers also to the full image rather than being something unrelated or unique itself. This may not exist.<br />
<hr />e) Find some Internet archival software that is open source and anyone can contribute to with respect to being themselves a crawler for that page. I am looking for something that is equivalent to archive.org that is resilient to nation state actors and cease and desist orders. This may not exist.<br />
<hr />f) Find a wikipedia like site that as a rule, does not delete articles ever no matter the dubious notoriety of those pages or merit in existing.<br />
<hr />g) Find a place on the net which documents clothing history such that it also acts as a database for all clothing to have been made available to the public. Something like a magazine archive but for all clothes.<br />
<hr />h) It is my observation as a life long pervert that inexplicably Japanese porn stars have much better breast implants than US or UK porn stars. Why?<br />
<hr />[1] Yes I wear women's hosiery as they are thinner when wearing dress shoes. Come at me bro. Also women's thigh highs are perfectly sized when worn with boxer briefs, I don't have any overlap in materials compared to when I am wearing long johns, so it is a better outcome/design.</div>

		<hr />
		
			BEIJING — China is exploring a new way to grapple with its mounting pile of bad corporate debt, though its top central banker sought on Saturday to dispel worries that the plan would simply shift the burden to other parts of the country’s vast economy.<br />
<br />
Under the tentative proposal, Chinese officials would allow banks saddled with growing quantities of bad loans to sell that debt to investors, said Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China. The goal is to help alleviate one of the major drags on China’s economy, the world’s second largest after the United States’ and a major driver of global growth.<br />
<br />
But Mr. Zhou and a deputy central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, said they would take steps to make sure the effort did not create the kind of risk-laden financial products that played a major role in the 2008 global financial crisis. The effort would be modest, regulators would monitor it closely, and mom-and-pop investors would be kept out, they said.<br />
<br />
“There’s no need to exaggerate,” Mr. Zhou said at a news conference held as part of China’s annual legislative session in Beijing. “There’s not certainty that this would be a very big market.”<br />
<br />
China’s corporate debt has ballooned in recent years during a broader lending-and-spending binge, led by the Chinese government in an attempt to keep the country’s economy humming. China’s total debt now stands at about 2.5 years’ economic output, a level that has raised worries among economists. Much of that is corporate debt, prompting many economists to warn that those loans pose a threat to China’s economic health.<br />
<br />
That lending spree has also led to a major surplus of Chinese steel factories, glassworks and other industrial facilities, dragging down China’s economic performance to its slowest rate in 25 years and casting a pall over the broader global outlook.<br />
<br />
On paper, China’s banks have some of the world’s lowest loan default rates. But economists inside and outside the country say many banks — in a practice known as “extend and pretend” — do not force companies to pay up or restructure, putting off the problem. That raises concerns that China’s big banks could have considerable amounts of bad loans on their books.<br />
<br />
The program sketched by the officials on Saturday followed reports in recent days that as the economy slows, some Chinese companies failing to pay back loans would be given reprieves because the banks would be allowed to convert that debt into shares of those companies. But the central bank officials did not directly address that proposal. On Thursday, a heavily indebted Chinese shipbuilding company revealed that it would issue equity to creditors instead of repaying $2.17 billion of outstanding loans.<br />
<br />
Some experts are skeptical that such a program would resolve the problem. “Using shares to pay overdue loans could help banks temporarily shore up their balance sheets, but it could cause greater difficulties down the road,” said Ning Zhu, a finance professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance.<br />
 <br />
Mr. Zhou indicated that under the proposal described on Saturday, the bad debt would be sold to institutional investors rather than being held by the banks. China already allows this practice — known as securitization — so banks and other financial institutions can sell off existing loans, freeing up capital for new business. But the central bankers’ latest comments suggested that the practice was being refined to focus on nonperforming loans.<br />
<br />
“Banks are positive about securitization,” Mr. Zhou said. “If some assets can be packaged and sold off, they can adjust their balance sheets.” He said that because the loans sold off would be troubled, they would fetch prices below their face value.<br />
<br />
Mr. Zhou and Mr. Pan stressed that the program would be modest at first and absorb lessons from the 2008 financial crisis. China’s new debt products would be kept simple, Mr. Pan said.<br />
<br />
“This is just a pilot,” Mr. Pan said. “We’ve selected a small number of major financial institutions with quite high management standards to develop trials, and the credit involved in the initial trials is not large.”<br />
<br />
Shang Fulin, the head of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said at a separate news conference on Saturday that the trial effort to sell off bad debt was needed to ensure that more bank loans flowed into supporting the real economy, rather than turning over old loans.<br />
<br />
“Our total volume of loans is quite adequate, but the speed of turnover of loans has been falling year after year,” Mr. Shang said.

			People squawking on their phones on public transportation is annoying as hell. That’s why one Chicago man allegedly took it upon himself to jam fellow commuters’ cell phone signals as part of a morning ritual that lasted months. Now he’s a charged felon in jail, being held for a $10,000 bail.<br />
<br />
Dennis Nicholl, 63, is accused of jamming mobile phone signals aboard the Red Line train in Chicago—a habit that one fellow Red Line commuter claims has been happening since 2014. It’s because people talking on trains annoy Nicholl, his lawyer says.<br />
<br />
Nicholl had allegedly operated an object that the Chicago Sun-Times describes as “an object that had five antennas” and that was “shipped from overseas.” Nicholls knew the gizmo was illegal. Police say passengers had been complaining about cell phone service on the train for months (Nicholl takes the Red Line to work everyday), and that one concerned passenger had even dialed 911. That’s when the cops got involved. <br />
<br />
Cops started working with the Chicago Transit Authority and the Federal Communications Commission, the Chicago Tribune reports, working off a tip they received months ago, as well as a submitted photo of Nicholl holding the black electronic jammer.<br />
<br />
After setting up plainclothes surveillance on the train, an undercover officer on Tuesday recognized Nicholl from his photo and sat near him. The cop used a personal cell phone to try to make a call, and it was immediately dropped. That’s when Nicholl was arrested.<br />
<br />
Today, Nicholl appeared in court, where the judge called him “the cell phone police.” He is being charged with a felony: one count of “count of unlawful interference with a public utility,” the Sun-Times reports.<br />
<br />
Apparently, Nicholl pulled a similar stunt back in 2009, but was only charged for a misdemeanor that time, and that jammer was confiscated and destroyed. People are debating whether he’s a hero or a villain. I’d be pissed if my phone ever got jammed—but hey, if something keeps other people from chattering obnoxiously or texting-and-walking, I guess I wouldn’t complain.

			In 2011, [China] ran a $276.5 billion trade surplus with the United States. This “accomplishment” stems largely from the fact that China is practicing economic mercantilism on an unprecedented scale. China seeks not merely competitive advantage, but absolute advantage. In other words, China’s strategy is to win in virtually all industries, especially advanced technology products and services. One may argue that all countries do this and assert it is the essence of competition. But China’s policies represent a departure from traditional competition and international trade norms. Autarky, not trade, defines China’s goal. As such China’s economic strategy consists of two main objectives: 1) develop and support all industries that can expand exports, especially higher value-added ones, and reduce imports; 2) and do this in a way that ensures that Chinese-owned firms win. It is time for policymakers in the United States and other countries to begin responding to today’s reality for <b>Chinese mercantilism represents a fundamental threat to not only the U.S. economy, but to the entire system of market and rules-based globalization.</b>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>The whole idea behind globalization is that maybe your country loses some specific manufacturing jobs.  But the world economy as a whole grows, you adapt and find new jobs and in the end everyone is better off.<br />
<br />
Sure, capitalists are able to profit from arbitrage opportunities presented by vastly different labor markets by winning the race to sell out their employees the fastest.  Mark Zuckerberg desperately wants to get in on this exploitation gravy train and sell out his rank&amp;file software engineers for H1B temps.  But ultimately, the effects of this kind of cruel greed are fairly limited and once traitorous sellouts take their cut, the economy will eventually benefit by greater overall growth.  All those offshore laborers stealing jobs will be new markets for new products, etc.<br />
<br />
But countries don't always play by the rules (even the US).  China is playing particularly unfairly.  The paper reviews a whole list of Chinese practices designed to give China absolute supremacy in the world economy by ensuring their labor is always cheaper than anyone else's and that the balance of trade always favors them dramatically.<br />
<br />

			The theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer reduce revenues going to innovators, making it more difficult for them to reinvest in R&amp;D. The manipulation of standards and other import restrictions balkanizes global markets, keeping them smaller than they otherwise would be, thereby raising global production costs. Further integration of global supply chains that link the United States and China could be good for both nations but not if Chinese policies continue to be based on absolute advantage and mercantilism. In this case, the results will be more of the same: the loss of U.S. industrial and high-tech output, and the jobs and GDP growth that go with it.

			China’s goal of absolute advantage through innovation mercantilism runs counter to the effective functioning of the global trading system, which is grounded in the notion of <b>competitive advantage: nations finding what they are good at or can be good at and exporting products and services in these areas to pay for the imports of goods and services they are not as good at producing.  Running an integrated global trading system that maximizes global economic welfare is impossible when the second-largest economy rejects the fundamental premise.</b>

			We already see this in nations like Brazil and India that are looking to emulate China by ramping up mercantilism. If this happens, it will be extremely difficult to maintain a global trading system that operates along the lines economists originally envisioned.

			In contrast to American economic policy, Chinese economic policy is not about maximizing short-term consumer welfare through free markets. Rather it is about maximizing long-term producer welfare and achieving autarky. And it’s a particular kind of producer welfare where the owner of the factors of production is the Chinese Communist Party. As such, the focus on producer welfare is tied not just to a particular theory of economic growth but to direct self-interest of the Chinese government and officials in it.<br />
<br />
To maximize producer welfare, China has put in place an array of mercantilist policies whose principal focus is on helping the home economy in an unfair manner at the expense of the global economy. <b>For Chinese mercantilists, it is not enough to compete to make a better product. Instead, they seek destroy the competition and make the only product.</b>

			While virtually all governments have crafted economic development policies to boost competitive advantage, China has developed the most comprehensive set of policies, with most of them violating the spirit, if not the letter of the law of the WTO. The second is their focus on Chinese firms, rather than Chinese establishments (e.g., Chinese factories and offices owned by Chinese or foreign firms). Most governments provide incentives to any establishment within their borders, regardless of its nationality. For Chinese leaders, at least since after 2006, Chinese firms are the key. Chinese mercantilist policies champion Chinese firms in two ways: the first is through policies designed to unfairly spur exports and reduce imports that help Chinese firms but also foreign firms in China. These policies include currency manipulation, relative high tariffs (three times higher than U.S. tariffs); and tax incentives for exports. The second is through policies designed to help Chinese firms while discriminating against foreign establishments in China. These policies take numerous forms including discriminatory government procurement; controls on foreign purchases designed to force technology transfer to China; land grants and rent subsidies to Chinese-owned firms; preferential loans from banks; tax incentives for Chinese-owned firms; cash subsidies; benefits to state-owned enterprises; generous export financing; government-sanctioned monopolies; a weak and discriminatory patent system; joint-venture requirements; forced technology transfer; intellectual property theft; cyber-espionage to steal intellectual property (IP); domestic technology standards; direct discrimination against foreign firms; limits on imports and sales by foreign firms; onerous regulatory certification requirements; and limiting exports of critical materials in order to deny foreign firms key inputs.

			This report analyzes the logic and factual basis for each of these justifications and asserts that none of them withstand close scrutiny. These claims are no more than rhetorical flourishes employed by Chinese officials to distract and throw off balance their opponents. As such, they should not be taken seriously.

			On one side are the analysts who look at China’s heavy-handed statist practices, its lack of respect for intellectual property, and its massive subsidies of particular technologies and argue that there is no way for this model to be successful, and therefore America does not need to worry. In fact, it is increasingly in vogue to argue that “China is about to fail.” The advice? Just be patient. No need to do anything. Proponents of this view believe as an article of faith that the Washington Consensus is the only real playbook for economic prosperity. Any nation misguided enough to follow an alternative model, especially one as distorted as the Beijing consensus, must by definition fail. Moreover, if the Chinese government is misguided enough to subsidize its exports, American consumers are the better off for it.<br />
But this school of thought ignores the fact that the Beijing consensus model has shown success; an economy growing at more than 10 percent per year for a decade is not failure. And even if China’s policies will mean its economic stagnation in the long term, they certainly inflict lasting damage to the U.S. and other countries, both in the short term and the long term.  Moreover, the standard for judging the threat from Chinese mercantilism is not whether China will succeed in dominating the industries America is good at, but rather whether Chinese mercantilist policies per se will harm the U.S. economy. On that basis, there should be no doubt.

			“Protectionists” are right in that it is important to ramp up the pressure on China to get it to start playing by the rules. But the notion that America can’t be competitive against China, even if the latter plays by the rules, is wrong, as is the notion that global integration with China can’t be in America’s and the world’s interests. America doesn’t need to close its borders to be a vibrant competitor. It must, however, require that other nations, especially large ones, like China, play by the rules.

</div>And speaking of playing by the rules, that means not encouraging your citizens to border jump into the the neighboring country and then sending remittances back home -- <a href="http://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/remittances-totaled-oil-income/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Remittances sent home by Mexicans working outside the country surpassed petroleum revenues in 2015 for the first time.</a><br />

			The most important question for the United States is what its overall strategic goal should be vis-à-vis strategic trade engagement with China. To date, that engagement has largely been what can be described as “whack a mole.” The United States expends resources to identify, respond to, and combat particular instances of Chinese mercantilism. Even if it wins such battles, all too often the damage has already been done. <b>The whack-a-mole strategy ultimately will be unsuccessful going forward because the Chinese government has shown that it can erect new mercantilist policies faster than the United States can get it to remove old ones. As a result, a new strategy needs to be grounded in a results-oriented trade regime. America and the broader community of free-trading nations, should hold China to specific goals. One is the significant reduction of its global trade surplus. China also needs to be held accountable for specific, quantifiable commitments to reduce levels of intellectual property piracy, use of global rather than domestic technology standards, and abandoning requirements for joint ventures and forced tech transfer, among other steps toward fair trade.</b>

</div>The paper is really long... at this point it starts going into more details.  Here's one last snippet about IP:<br />

			China, like many developing nations, frequently asserts that intellectual property controls are a form of Western imperialism designed to keep them poor. One Chinese official complained that they have to pay too much for foreign intellectual property and that this is a legitimate reason for the move to dramatically increase the number of created-in-China technologies. As Dan Breznitz states, Chinese officials and corporate leaders “agree that Chinese companies should not have to pay for the right to use a technology that every economic actor is required to use.”203 But this misses three points. First, China has almost $3 trillion in foreign exchange earnings from chronic trade surpluses that it could use to purchase foreign IP. Because of its stage of development, China’s economy specializes in cost-based production. Because of their stage of development, Europe, Japan and the United States specialize in innovation and IP-based production. By refusing to pay for IP, the Chinese are refusing to cede competitive advantage in anything. Second, if China doesn’t want to import IP, what does it want to buy from developed nations? After all, Western nations like the United States have invested trillions of dollars to develop IP. (The answer of course, is that they want to buy very little).
