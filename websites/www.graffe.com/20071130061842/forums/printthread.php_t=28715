Well my friends, it appears there is a developer who plays a wizard.  He registered his board in January, so not sure if he is a new addition.  Jacobitz in this thread explains a little about quad kiting  :eek: and points to Graffe's for further info:<br />
<br />

<br />
He seems to appreciate the finer points of multiple mob deaths. :)</div>

It does look like someone is actually <i>trying</i> to play wiz, and using tactics that have previously favored the cloth-caped crusaders. I sincerely hope that he does discover what has plagued many of our &quot;masters of [fill-in-whatever-expansion]&quot; brethren.<br />
<br />
Go go Jacobitz! Seriously, feel free to experience every aspect of being wiz! You will find a <i>tremendously enjoyable</i> class that will easily shame many others. Unfortunately, at the upper-levels you will find you can easily be humiliated by far too many others (unless you have many supporters that can help you achieve what has essentially been unobtainable to the vast majority of players of this class). The wizard class is not meant to be easy, but at the higher levels it is also not meant to be easily cast aside, which currently is an easy thing to do.<br />
<br />
I truly do hope that wiz is your main Jacobitz, some first-hand insight as to what plagues this highly beneficial breed of character is, without doubt, very long over-due. Far too many knowledgable players of this class have been ignored as to what could be used to benefit us - if you are able to understand even a micron of what they have experienced, it will benefit all.<br />

		<div>Lol, you have to read it carefuly.<br />
<br />
that guy is SURELY not a main wiz nor a main dev.<br />
<br />
He said all by himself, that &quot;he has not a high level wiz&quot; to be able to try to quad higher level mobs. (I assume his WIz is in the range of level 30-40).<br />
This lead me to the following conclusions:<br />
<br />
- He can't testbuff a Wizard (LMAO, that's a great Dev, really)<br />
- He is not a main WIzard, like Summar already suspected.<br />
- He has no clue about the real stuff going on.<br />
<br />
Jaco, if you read this, try your megabombastic tactics in OOW and GoD.<br />
<br />
The shooter: He admitted he is not sure about the game mechannics in certain aspects. (&quot;I believe they've changed that...&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ya, there is probably some coffe-maker maid playing a Wiz at SoE.<br />

As shallow as his post may have been, it sure was a lot more informative than the current trend that graffe.com has.  I used to scan the posts here a few times a day growing up as a wizard, once maybe twice a month now.<br />

In case it deludes you, Graffe's informations are pretty fresh: Wizards have been turned obsulete. All other informations, about the lowbie game are here as well. So what? There is nothing else to add to this, but the fact that customers could expect a little more from a Dev but this clueless lil' boy over there.<br />
<br />
/shudder, hopefully he will not be responsible for this dead class in the future, fortunaly not much more harm can be done anyway.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest he should join the &quot;Make-Jokes-About-Customers-Dev-Gang&quot; instead and then work slowly up. They are pretty good in that, i assume.</div>

You take bitching and raise it to an absolute art form.

And as far as game mechanics go about more than 4 mobs hitting you at the same time....well I seem to recall that lots of people (wizards in graffe channel) didn't know about it recently.....and this was changed well before PoP was out.<br />

The antropologists can learn much more from you than from me, Clod.<br />

You, Clod bitch as much as i do, just from the opposite end. So, get off the highhorse, Mr BARD.<br />
In your world Wizards are fine as long as they have supersnare exodus (TM). Regarding carrying a cross... i wouldn't throw with stones in the glasshouse, Mr &quot;your parses are flawed&quot;.<br />
<br />
And i still played my Wiz untill some days ago. You quit your Wiz YEARS ago. SO i have any right to bitch as much as i want, more than you anyway.<br />
<br />
PS: If that guy is the one taking care for our class, this would explain a lot. He is totally clueless.<br />
Actually it explains a ton. If SOE hires such dilletantish, nope, ignorant clueless &quot;devs&quot; then all makes sense all of sudden.<br />
They have no idea about their very own game. A very good joke. Now i am joking about the joking Devs, haha.</div>

		<div>Wow, Nehtaniel.  You really get around.  I sent you a private message on the EQ boards.  Take a look if you haven't read it yet and let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
I haven't played regularly in well over a year, but I only ever really played 1 class.  I loved wizards so much I played 2 of them.  Rolfe and Ralfe.  52 and 60 both on Povar.  I never had a great interest in raiding, so I can't really get into any debates on how useful/useless wizards might be in that area of the game.  The most fun I had was trying to figure out how to do crazy stuff alone or in small groups.  For the way that I played a wizard, I never had any complaints really.  There's tradeoffs for any class you pick, but when it comes down to it, tanks will never take down 30 blue/white mobs at once solo.  They won't even take down 4 at once; and that's something that even Natan could do.<br />
<br />
There was a time when that PBAOE kiting guide was cutting edge.  That was Rolfe and Ralfe's prime I think.  But just because the specifics in that guide no longer work because of a change in the AI doesn't mean that the entire line of thinking is bad or that the entire guide is useless.  There are still bigger ways, better ways, more interesting, more novel, or just more fun ways of doing things that root and nuke.  And that's what it's all about.</div>

		<div>If Jacobitz plays a wizard perhaps he will appreciate our concerns more than other development programmers will.   I think that too many development programmers see our concerns and think we're being too pessimistic.  The truth is that as a class, Wizards have been losing ground to other dps classes (Especially rogues) for a long time now.  <br />

He was aware of the quadding guides at Graffe's so he must be aware of many of our concerns.  I see this as a glimmer of hope, that some development programmers at at least reading our concerns.  Maybe Jacobitz will be the voice that we've needed at SOE for so long.  Hopefully he'll take some of the reasonable ideas that we've come up with and they'll be incoperated into the game.  <br />

The potion belt does sounds a lot like the &quot;At the ready&quot; slots that were suggested a few months back.</div>
