				Human Experiments: A Chronology of Human Research<br />
by Vera Hassner Sharav<br />
6th century B.C.: Meat and vegetable experiment on young Jewish prisoners in Book of Daniel.<br />
<br />
5th century B.C: &quot;Primum non nocere&quot; (&quot;First do no harm&quot;), medical ethics standard attributed to Hippocrates. This Oath became obligatory for physicians prior to practicing medicine in the 4th century AD<br />
<br />
1st century B.C. Cleopatra devised an experiment to test the accuracy of the theory that it takes 40 days to fashion a male fetus fully and 80 days to fashion a female fetus. When her handmaids were sentenced to death under government order, Cleopatra had them impregnated and subjected them to subsequent operations to open their wombs at specific times of gestation. [<a href="http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/NaziMedExNotes.html#1]" target="_blank">http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/NaziMedExNotes.html#1]</a> <br />
<br />
12th century: Rabbi and physician Maimonides' Prayer: &quot;May I never see in the patient anything but a fellow creature in pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
1796 Edward Jenner injects healthy eight-year-old James Phillips first with cowpox then three months later with smallpox and is hailed as discoverer of smallpox vaccine.<br />
<br />
1845-1849: J. Marion Sims, &quot;the father of gynecology&quot; performed multiple experimental surgeries on enslaved African women without the benefit of anesthesia. After suffering unimaginable pain, many lost their lives to infection. One woman was made to endure 34 experimental operations for a prolapsed uterus. <a href="http://www.coax.net/people/lwf/jm_sims.htm" target="_blank">http://www.coax.net/people/lwf/jm_sims.htm</a> <br />
<br />
<br />
1865: French physiologist Claude Bernard publishes &quot;Introduction to the Study of Human Experimentation,&quot; advising: &quot;Never perform an experiment which might be harmful to the patient even though highly advantageous to science or the health of others.&quot; <br />
<br />
1896: Dr. Arthur Wentworth performed spinal taps on 29 children at Children's Hospital, Boston, to determine if the procedure was harmful. Dr. John Roberts of Philadelphia, noting the non-therapeutic indication, labeled Wentworth's procedures &quot;human vivisection.&quot; <br />
<br />
1897: Italian bacteriologist Sanarelli injects five subjects with bacillus searching for a causative agent for yellow fever. <br />
<br />

<br />
1900: Berlin Code of Ethics. Royal Prussian Minister of Religion, Education, and Medical Affairs guaranteed that: &quot;all medical interventions for other than diagnostic, healing, and immunization purposes, regardless of other legal or moral authorization are excluded under all circumstances if (1) the human subject is a minor or not competent due to other reasons; (2) the human subject has not given his unambiguous consent; (3) the consent is not preceded by a proper explanation of the possible negative consequences of the intervention.&quot; <a href="http://www.geocities.com/artnscience/00berlincode.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/artnscience/00berlincode.pdf</a> <br />

<br />
The settlement of Poe v. Lynchburg Training School and Hospital (same institution, different name) in 1981 brought to an end the Virginia law.

Despite Rhoads' hand written statements that the Puerto Rican population should be eradicated, Rhoads went on to establish U.S. Army Biological Warfare facilities in Maryland, Utah, and Panama, and was later named to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Rhoads was also responsible for the radiation experiments on prisoners, hospital patients, and soldiers.

&quot;I cut him open from the chest to the stomach and he screamed terribly and his face was all twisted in agony. He made this unimaginable sound, he was screaming so horribly. But then finally he stopped. This was all in a day's work for the surgeons, but it really left an impression on me because it was my first time.&quot; NYT <br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Amidst the new security verification "dongle" Blizzard has offered, has anyone noticed a major increase of accounts getting hacked? I don't want to cry conspiracy theory or anything like that, but it seems like a hell of a lot of people are getting their accounts compromised lately. I know the last major issue was with flash, but is there something more recent? <br />
<br />
Instead of transferring my characters, I decided I'd be a good excuse to stop playing (or at least have a major cutback/break until I transferred). Almost immediately after my friend took his account back, it was compromised. He got it back but of course damage had been done. Logic tells me it's on his PC because I essentially logged on only once and never had any issues what-so-ever the year plus I had been playing and he jumped on WoW on a PC that had not been updated in over a year (dun dun dun). My other accounts have not had any issues. I did a witch hunt for any malware just to be sure but didn't find anything. Fun part was my rogue on his account was doing what I can only imagine as exploiting in shadow labs. GM's eventually restored everything but enchanting materials, primals, and badges. Friend then ran scans, updated flash, etc (by now he was the only one that was logging on) but once again the account had been compromised under a new password. This time it seems we caught the hacker mid exploitation in shadow labs. My rogues gear was nearly broken, but had amassed over 1000g and a ton of greens (smells like the old dire maul exploit with chests). My friend got the account back, ran scans again and nada. Except this time he also got a 14 day ban for making key logger posts, and the account was riddled with level 1s with spammer-like names. So while I was on I was talking to a couple of people and I kept hearing "wtf so and so got hacked too," but by people that had not been account sharing.<br />
<br />
It all seems like the same thing too, updated with ms updates, firefox (mostly), latest flash, virus software updated, ran other random virus checker/remover and nothing shows up, etc. yet they still got hacked somehow (and even some compromised again after). Two people in another friends guild even had their characters/gold transferred by the hacker, then stripped on a different server. Almost like they got Phished myspace style. <br />
<br />
Now I'm not real familiar with how key loggers work, but given their architecture, aren't they fairly easy to detect with basic scanners or has something changed? A friend told me about rootkits, but going that far and only stealing WoW login information would be kinda unlikely.</div>

Question: What are the best laptop brands and the worst laptop brands? <br />
<br />
I'm looking at the low end of laptop machines for just simple usage and maybe a older game or two. Dual core, or Turion TL70 (intel x3100 gpu sucks, I'm looking at machines with ati 1250/1270 gpu in it) ... this means around $600-700 range.<br />
<br />
I very nearly bought an Acer the other day but was warned off by people citing display issues and a non-existant support staff. Toshiba refuses to make Xp drivers, but I dont know how their hardware holds up over time.<br />
<br />
I owned a gateway and had nothing but great luck with it... sadly I just found out Acer bought Gatway. I dont know if any of the current hardware is now being made by them or acer. Dell seems to be given high marks but more expensive.</div>

				Australian doctors have raised concerns about clinics offering vaginal cosmetic surgery, warning the trend towards so-called &quot;designer vaginas&quot; may be exploiting vulnerable women.<br />
<br />
The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said procedures being offered included &quot;vaginal rejuvenation, revirgination, designer vaginoplasty and G-spot amplification&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is involved in these procedures is often unclear since recognised clinical nomenclature is not being used,&quot; it said in a position paper released this week.<br />
<br />
The college labelled the procedures dangerous, expensive and unwarranted, and said it strongly discouraged surgery that was not backed by scientific evidence or clinical trials.<br />
<br />
&quot;The real risks of potential complications such as scarring, permanent disfigurement, infection, dyspareunia and altered sexual sensations should be discussed in detail with women seeking such treatments,&quot; it said.<br />
<br />
The college said women should understand that there were a large number of variations in the appearance of normal female genitalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;The college is particularly concerned that such surgery may exploit vulnerable women,&quot; it said.<br />
<br />
Ted Weaver, chairman of the college's women's health committee, said most of the operations cost at least 10,000 dollars (9,500 US), which he described as an &quot;extraordinary amount of money&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;We feel these operations might prey on people with insecurities and fears who actually need psychological help,&quot; he told Australian Associated Press.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are also not very anatomically-based and have the potential to cause serious harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctors in the United States and Britain have raised similar concerns about the surgery.

<br />
So what web comics do you still follow? Personally checked on a regular basis:<br />
<a href="http://www.dilbert.com" target="_blank">Dilbert</a> - Not checked daily but every second day or so<br />
<a href="http://www.pvponline.com" target="_blank">PVP Online</a> - This is now purely on automatic routine if they story arc is actually starting up or not but but lost a lot of charm.<br />
<a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/" target="_blank">Girl Genious Online</a>Got this one from here, love it :)<br />
<a href="http://www.giantitp.com/" target="_blank">Giant in the Playground</a> - Follow both even though OOTS is meh now and Erfworld is slooow.<br />
<a href="http://userfriendly.org/" target="_blank">User Friendly</a> - Purely for the tech support comics, so damn true...<br />
<a href="http://wtfcomics.com/" target="_blank">WTF Comic</a> - Only EQ Comic I still follow so I guess it is nostalgia at this stage, slow as heck on updates though.<br />
<a href="http://www.flipsidecomics.com/" target="_blank">Flipside Comics</a> - My latest and greatest favourite. Some mature pictures etc. in there and I at this stage it is over 1000 pages long ongoing story! If you read it make sure you check out book 0 first (26 chapters at 30 pages each with worse drawing but has a lot of back story). <br />
<a href="http://www.freakangels.com/" target="_blank">Freak Angels</a> - Another Graffe recommendation, updates every Friday and still holds my attention.<br />
<a href="http://www.lfgcomic.com" target="_blank">LFG Comic</a> - Has lost a lot of it's charm but &quot;For Pony!&quot; still ring true in my ears.<br />
<br />
So give up ze goods!</div>
