Not sure what people will think of this. From what I have heard, the Nigerian government is suing a number of tobacco firms under the same grounds that a number of US states successfully sued them for back in the 90s. Due to tobacco profits flatlining in the West they have sought to expand markets in the Developing World - using many of the tactics they were employing in 50s America when noone but the tobacco firms knew how dangerous tobacco is. One of the more worrying assertions, for example, is that firms are accused of going to pop concerts attended by teenagers and giving out free packets of cigarettes and such.<br />
<br />
The Nigerian government is basically suing for the amount of money they estimate their health service has spent and will have to spend over the next few decades on treating the extra cancer victims caused by the underhand tactics of tobacco firms. <br />
<br />
Is this reasonable of the Nigerian government? Could it be argued that there is noone in this day and age who is unaware of the link between smoking and cancer, even in the Developing World? If not, is it not primarily the responsibility of the Nigerian government to either educate their population or alternately make cigarettes illegal?<br />
<br />
But if the accusations of firms giving cigarettes away free to children is true, amongst other things, do they deserve everything they get?</div>

Company comes in (doesn't matter what) using deceptive practices - providing &quot;age inapporpriate product&quot;, and it's  a product known to be hazardous and habit forming.   So, they're basically being immoral as all hell right?<br />

		<div>And pray tell me why we have not sent Special Forces into the tobacco companies' HQs and liquidated their execs with the most extreme prejuice for genocide against our OWN people, hm?<br />
<br />
The W.H.O. statistics suggest that the total death toll form tobacco will be *250 million* by the middle of this century. Considering the monsters in charge of the tobacco companies KNEW about this, covered it up AND added more addictive/poisonous substances, they have utterly outdone Stalin, Hitler and Mao, combined. Now, whya re those MTFers not dead, hm?<br />
Screw suing 'em, they are guilty of genocide. How many of you here on this baord have known friends or family of older geneartions, who died from this?<br />
Raise your hands.<br />
<br />
*RAISE*<br />
<br />
One sues for gross negligence, one executes/bombs for millions of deaths.<br />
<br />
Remember, older generations did not know, it was only suspected, and the tobacco companies pressured hard against nay sayers.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the Godwin, but this *IS* a Final Solution, MKII. Except this time, it's not down to racism, but greed.<br />
<br />
And for the record, I still wouldn't ban tobacco, but it and every drug including booze, should be restricted in sale to adults, from limited venues, by credit card only, and ANYONE who tries selling them as &quot;mere harmless consumer goods&quot; should get cranially ventilated. Seen booze and cigarettes kill and wreck too many folk I knew and love, heroin ain't got a bloody look in by comparison.</div>

*nod* Exactly, mate :)<br />
People's lives are their own, even to ruin, but drugs are absolutely NOT like *any* other consumer good: they are <i>addictive</i>, and nearly all damage the mind if not the body. We msut strongly discourage them, but not make them &quot;forbidden taboo exotic sexy&quot;, nor let criminals have them. Only way to do this is legalization but make damns ure they are not available form cornershop/supermarkets, and that goes doubly for booze/tobacco, because folk have a very dumb attiotude to them, ecouraged by grossly foul sales peddling. Some cigarette advertising *deliberately* targetted kids.<br />
Hey maybe I'm weird, but someone peddling poison to kid deserves &quot;Ecky Thump&quot; :D<br />
<br />
jeesh, I love a nice Drambuie, cider etc, but I *know* it's a highly dangerous drug if you mess with it. Most folk cannot accept that truth.<br />
Only booze meant to flavour/table should be on <i>open </i>sale with the alcohol strength so low you'd need to drink a gallon or two to get a buzz :D<br />
<br />
Each town should have a specialized sales point, and ONLY one, for drugs, of all types.<br />
