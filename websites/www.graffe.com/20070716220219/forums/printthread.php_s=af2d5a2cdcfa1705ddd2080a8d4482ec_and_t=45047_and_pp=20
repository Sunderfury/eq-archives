		<div>It happens to me A LOT.<br />
<br />
Harvest cast, I dont move, dont speak, dont touch my keys, no ae hitting me, nothing, and harvest fails to deliver.  For now apparent reason.<br />
<br />
What Hormiga is saying, is that he has noticed that when he has bard mana song, he casts harvest, and is waiting for it to fire, bard song stops (either stopped singing, bard moved oor whatever reason, bard song falls off short buff box), harvest fails.<br />
<br />
In general this spell is failing for no apparent reason far too frequently, and we should all be watching and documenting the circumstances of that so we can try and figure out why.<br />
<br />
I also have a recurrent bug, that I have feedbacked and /bug reported numerous times, where I actually lose a normal buff when harvest fires.  It happens normall with the same buff, usually druid FoE, and happens when the buff is brand new just cast on me, frist or last buff slot or in the middle it wont matter, it kills it, and the druid doesnt even get a &quot;buff wore off&quot; message.<br />
<br />
The spell is def buggy, so just be vigilant and lets see what we can figure out.</div>

		<div>Happens to me quite a lot and has nothing to do with bard songs - happens when I solo too. The flashing icon simply disappears from the song window, before even running its full course. And no mana. Usually it disappears within the first 6 seconds (1 tick), which makes me suspect that it's one of those lag-related bugs (similar to the mana regen going up and down because the client thinks it's time to add 1 tick of mana to your pool and the server disagrees and corrects it down).</div>

		<div>I box a bard and wiz all the time and have never had this happen to me. If it is bard related my guess would be it's from Vesthma's Lively Crescendo, a doom type effect song, bard casts it (buff only appears for bard) 30 seconds later if he is close to the group they get 200 ish HP 500 ish mana. HP/mana figures aren't accurate, but the code, which sounds similar to harvest, may be getting mixed up.</div>

		<div>Sorry, I do not mean to sound mean or anything, but as often as it happens to me  and other wizards I know and speak to a lot,  you people who say it doesn't ever happen must be totally not paying attention.<br />
<br />
This is a horrible bug, it happens grouped, solo, in ae, out of ae, on raids, out of raids,  all the time!  I can be standing alone in the middle of Felwithe, hit my hotkey for the spell, and  push back from my desk and not touch a thing, not even breathe!  and it fails.   But at the same time, sometimes it fires and goes fine  when it shouldnt.  Like the day in Icefall when I cast it, and then my kid jumped on me and hit my hotkey for the new demensional instability aa, and it sent me flying into a tent full of goblins and back and it still fired and filled off my mana.<br />
<br />
So come on wizards, watch and see, pay better attention.  It really doesnt matter what level of the game you play at, if you solo, group, raid, casual, whatever.  This spell is a  nice boost to us, and we should be watching it and trying to learn what the issue is.  So dont go afk after you cast it, stay and wait till it fires or fails and under what circumstances it does either.<br />

		<div>Um, I do pay attention, and it hasn't happened to me.<br />
<br />
In fact, I've been surprised at some of the stuff I've been able to harvest through, including AE's that have shot me across the room.<br />
<br />
Actually, while we're on strange bugs, I'll bring up one I've only seen perhaps a total of 4 times, and I'm trying to figure out what's causing it...except its a bug in our favor.  Every so often, I'll notice pyromancy hit for 1k on a tick rather than 500.  It's not a crit, obviously...I'm trying to figure out if its because pyro triggered and is running, and then triggered again to overlap, but haven't been able to get it to happen when I have the time to really watch it.<br />
<br />
Anyone else seen that happen?</div>

		<div>I use Patient Harvest upwards of 30 times a night. The hadnful of times it has failed for me in the last couple months have been cases where I got distracted and cast a nuke, or had autoattack on, like a fool. So, no unexplained failures out of likely 2000+ casts for me.<br />
<br />
I wonder if it's a bug on a particular server? Is it possible certain accounts could have this and not others?<br />

Does it happen if you log in and play on a different PC?</div>
