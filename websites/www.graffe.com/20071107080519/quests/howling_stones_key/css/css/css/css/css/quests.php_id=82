I will need a Silver Wand from a Silvered Guard in the Temple Cazic Thule, A Bloodblack Wand from the Mountains of Rathe, Twice-Woven Silk from a Faerie Guard in Faydark and a Scepter of Tears from the Tomb in Castle Mistmoore. Bring me these items and I will make for you a Weeping Wand. 
<HR>
Silver Wand - A Silvered Tae Ew Observer outside of Cazic Thule in Feerrott (approximately level 25). You'll see it if he has it or not. It's a random spawn and whether he has it or not is random as well. 
<HR>
Bloodback Wand - Giant Skeleton (approx level 25) in Rathe Mountain. It's a relatively easy and common drop. (Zone from Feerrott and stay left. Roughly -900, -1700)
<HR>
Twice Woven Silk - Faerie Guard (approx level 25) in Lesser Faydark (Roughly +1000, +3800). Tough little lass and while she's always there. The silk drop is random and somewhat common. You may have to take on up three or four Faeries as well as Gearheart.
<HR>
Sceptre of Sorrow - Ssynthi (a book holding Shadowman) in Castle Mistmoore. He's back behind the Tomb in the graveyard. He'll ask you to retrieve a flower from inside the Tomb. The respawn for the flower is really fast (looks like a small bag when atop the casket). When you give it to him he'll give you the Sceptre as well as a little experience and it'll raise your faction with the Temple of Solusek Ro in case you've done something bad like kill him for the robe.
