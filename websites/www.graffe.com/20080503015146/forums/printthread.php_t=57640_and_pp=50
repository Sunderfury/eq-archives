		<div>i wish you the best luck in life, make up with girlfriend or move on...... I understand how it is to sacrifice soo many things for the community and for the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am going to go aoc as well. The update is really crap and i am not willing to sacrifice anymore real life time for this game. That was the last straw for my sorceror. I checked the abilities extensively today with guildies.<br />
<br />
Sorry AVAIR!!!! This is all crap.<br />
<br />
Pvp server died...... 2 major guilds disbanded. People are leaving for aoc. No idea if they are coming back or not but still ... 88 people european day time. 34 people in my guild LAw in the afternoon 120 on the whole server. <br />
<br />
<br />
Until aoc is out of beta i will still play with guildies... this is the only thing that has kept me in this game....<br />
<br />
So i wish everyone the best of luck.... will troll forums</div>

<br />
Here's an advance for next time. Don't go into the MMOing so hardcore, stay casual. Yeah its different but the fun is the same, at least it works for me.<br />
I was really hardcore during 4+ years in EQ, I loved it but at the same time it has downsides on RL. <br />
<br />
In WoW I started hardcore but almost costed me my relationship so I managed to tone it down and it worked. Later I quit WoW because of its lack of depth (only played from its release and a year on).<br />
<br />
When I bought Vanguard I made a deal with myself, now having house, wife, family and a good job. *Casual approach or don't buy it.* I bought Vanguard and have been able to find a nice balance with a &quot;casual raiding guild&quot;. I'm still having as fun as ever! <br />
<br />
Maybe not something that works for everyone but could be something to consider, don't have to quit fully.</div>

Recently I have tried playing the game an hour or two during a few of the days of any given week rather than playing at every avialable opportunity.  Sometimes with MMOs it is hard to stop thinking about them when not playing since it always feels like there is something that needs to be completed or accomplished.</div>

I realy wish I could have accomplished something good before I quit.<br />
I know current sorc version isn't realy what you expected (it's not what I expected either).<br />
<br />
When I start something, I always love to go as father as I can. But being an hardcore player and classlead asked me all my attention, and I forgot that I had a life.<br />
<br />
Now I want to put all my effort into my life, who knows, maybe one day I'll be an important Game Designer for a big MMORPG and that you'll all play my game :). (And of course, I'll know how to code, hehe)<br />

		<div>Jades, I think you might play a game more casually. I don't play games every day, and I don't raid regularly. To me, games are not 0 or 1, and yes or no question. I don't need to put 100% life or 0% life on it. And well, my main character is Druid and my sorceror is below 20, but if I don't play Age of Conan, I would level it up eventually.</div>
