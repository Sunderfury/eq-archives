So in AC story, the ranger mobs throw spike traps at your feet. You can't really stop it, so you dodge it (big red circle). The elementalists on the other hand do an aoe rain (that I don't think has a warning circle) that is channeled. You can use a knockback or daze to stop it.<br />

I think aspects of the interface and encounters could stand to be a little more intuitive, but generally you will get more comfortable the more you run it.</blockquote>

We were having a rough time last night until we actually started using some of our utility skills more effectively. The health pools are a little large yes, but really some of the dungeons only have 4 or 5 trash pulls at all so it's not like its some long mindless grind. <br />

Overall though I think the dungeons are significantly harder than the rest of the game and have definitely been a wakeup call both times I did them.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I did the new CM story mode last night, and thought it was still pretty easy. People overreacted by quite a bit with that one. If anything, all they did was make it more annoying. The two exceptions weren't even things people warned me about, 1) the door guard no longer is a damage sponge that just stands there until he dies, he's a warrior that spams hundred blades and is quite nasty. 2) I think they broke mob aggro in one of the latest patches. Sometimes stuff will link from extreme ranges (it happens to me in outdoors content as well), and at one point we ended up fighting three groups of enemies at once.<br />
<br />
Anyway, one way they made it annoying was by giving the trash obscene health pools. It was stupid, and I guess this is their answer to speed running. I've heard later dungeons do the same thing, and I really think they should rethink this. Combat is interesting when you are in danger, but when you wail on something that isn't a threat for 5 minutes you are going to get bored.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">This game has the potential to be the best MMO ever, but they need to fix some things fairly urgently (and not wait until the big patch on October 1st).<br />
<br />
 - Queues for WvWvW. Telling people to move to another server isn't a good answer, they need to work on the queues. Put a timer on each, give you an estimated timer when they look at the queues, and figure out some way of letting more people play. <br />
<br />
 - Fix the damn broken events. <br />
<br />
 - Fix Orr. Seriously, it sucks. I've always wanted death zones like we used to get in EQ, and Orr happily does that to you but it's just *not fun*. I can take 3 / 4 mobs at a time now so it's not a difficulty thing, its just the fact you spend all your time fighting mobs just trekking anywhere and the mobs have designed to be annoying as possible. Knockbacks, roots, AE pulls - the works.<br />
<br />
 - Fix the scaling on events. Orr on my server is basically locked down because even on prime time there just aren't enough people to actually *do* the events. They need to scale down as well as up, and if there's 5 people trying to do something then as long as it isn't one of the huge ones (dragons, temples etc) then they should have a chance. Being overwhelmed by waves of undead AEing *again* is not fun.<br />
<br />
 - Fix the damn events. (for emphasis). Orr doesn't even have any hearts, so when the damn things break all the time it leaves you very pissed off at how you are supposed to progress in the zones. <br />
<br />
 - Just remove the storyline from the game. In all seriousness, between Destiny's Edge and Treaherne this game is so full of dreadfully written, completely inexplicable Mary Sue characters that anyone involved in the writing should be barred from ever typing on a keyboard again. I don't understand how the teams that did the GW1 storylines came up with such utter piles of wank. The worse storylines of any MMO ever. What person wants to play second fiddle to some unknown character the designers wedge in for no apparent reason who can't actually DO anything!<br />
(This would also mean the removal of the last storyline mission of the game, which is so hilariously bad and such a huge let-down it would be to everyone's benefit).<br />
<br />
 - Fix events. <br />
<br />
 - Make storymodes easier in dungeons. So far exploratory modes have been far better tuned, far tighter, far more fun and quicker than story modes. That seems completely out of wack with the design of storymodes. (They give crappy items, crappy rewards, and the only benefit seems to be unlocking exploratory modes and continuing with the &quot;story&quot;. So far, the first 4 dungeons all had the same story - you go in with some Destiny's Edge people, meet up with another Destiny's Edge person, one of them gets angry about some shit I don't care about and then they run off and leave you until the next dungeon. Repeat ad nausem). <br />
<br />
 - Give Mesmer's main hand pistols. just because!<br />
<br />
This is the best designed world of any MMO I've played - it has artistic integrity and vision coming out of every pore. It has wonderfully designed mechanics, and huge changes to the very basic way we play these games which are genius. But all these silly little things are really making it unfun to play. So far I've reached two of the Grand Temples in Orr - and both were bugged and unable to be opened. that is NOT the type of experience you want to be giving people who have suffered through those zones!</blockquote>

</div>I agree with pretty much everything you said.  Orr isn't fun.  I like the term &quot;death zones&quot; because that's exactly what they are.  They're not as bad as EQ &quot;death zones&quot; where mob density was so great you couldn't leave the zone in without aggroing stuff that took a full group to kill.  But mob density is very high and these mobs are rough.  One on one, no problem.  Two on one I can handle but any more than that and I really need to pop all cool downs and pray.<br />
<br />
I also agree with Story Mode dungeon tuning.  It's very high right now.  I've only done two so far.  One AC with Dmitry who knew the place inside and out so things went, relatively, smooth and another Arah with a complete PUG.  We did fine in Arah until we hit the Airship and then it was death after death after death.<br />
<br />
And speaking of Dmitry, where are you at with the game these days?    I know you're still logging on here and there but, by now, I figure you've done pretty much everything.  Personally I'm still having fun with the game but I'm starting to run out of things to do.  I, still, have absolutely no interest in Pandas though.</blockquote>

Starting to notice the death zone phenomenon, the buggy events, etc. Also, as prophesied in another thread, the story has taken a turn for the WTF. (Though I loved the first bit. If you roll a human, select never-joined-the-circus!) <br />
<br />
As an engineer I have a problem of too many potential playstyles. I tried bombs for a while, but I was too squishy to make that work, although it rocked when kiting melee. Grenades are amazing underwater. Flamethrower is, sadly, lackluster: strafing around can cause it to miss. :( Turrets are dumbfire, and I endured enough of that as an EQ mage!<br />

Still having fun though. I have a guardian who is a pretty kitty in a hat, and she is a raging whirlwind of death with a greatsword.</blockquote>

But yeah, agree with everything Maledict says.  There are probably as many broken events as working events in the higher level zones.  Tree dude is like the ultimate Mary Sue with crappy writing.<br />
<br />
If the game didn't have down leveling and so much content packed into every zone this game would be dead right now. Kinda hoping they have it all fixed in the next 3 months but its probably going to be in the next 6-8months where its in decent working order.</blockquote>

			<div class="message">My engineer is 73 and things are getting both simultaneously more awesome and more sucky. Starting to notice the death zone phenomenon, the buggy events, etc. Also, as prophesied in another thread, the story has taken a turn for the WTF. (Though I loved the first bit. If you roll a human, select never-joined-the-circus!) <br />
<br />
As an engineer I have a problem of too many potential playstyles. I tried bombs for a while, but I was too squishy to make that work, although it rocked when kiting melee. Grenades are amazing underwater. Flamethrower is, sadly, lackluster: strafing around can cause it to miss. :( Turrets are dumbfire, and I endured enough of that as an EQ mage!<br />
<br />
Still having fun though. I have a guardian who is a pretty kitty in a hat, and she is a raging whirlwind of death with a greatsword.</div>

</div>Grenade kits is fucking awesome to level with. I want you to die: a) quickly, b) in a swarm of explosions, and c) BURN!<br />
<br />
My human engineer is 26 now and happily murdering things by the boatload. I poop out healing turret and rocket turret and just alternate as needed between rifle and grenades. Unless it's harder than a veteran or I have 3+ I rarely have trouble killing things quickly. I like rifle for autoaim, but grenades are just DPS in a handbasket.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">My problem with grenades is: no autoattack, mouse-pointer aiming for everything. The aiming is a layer of complexity that makes kiting hard, at least for me. You can enable autoattack for elixir gun, flamethrower, and bombs manually (you have to re-enable it every time you swap to the kit, sadly). Underwater, grenades don't require the aiming and hence are exploding sex in a basket.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Rifle 5 is great for vistas and jumping puzzles. It won't actually let you get anywhere you couldn't by jumping, but it makes difficult jumps a little easier.</blockquote>

One of the reasons why I have paused my  minion master necro, is the fact that I ended up using staff 24/7. 2-5 on staff = ground targeting. Yech :(</blockquote>
