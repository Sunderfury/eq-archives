			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I am really enthusiastic about these phones for various reasons, and I am very interested in making in my next phone, however the one catch for me is that all of the phones seem to not have a camera that is comparable to any of the higher end Android or iOS phones.  <br />
<br />
And, while I do not care about the rest of the features they have, I only ever carry around my phone for photo and video purposes, and with an even worse camera available the already low quality pictures will be dramatically worse.<br />
<br />
I realize Mozilla is targeting the lower end, however are there any manufactured or planned phones which do target a higher end product, or at least one that has a nicer camera available? <br />
<br />
I would like to switch to this entirely, but without that I will have to wait for such a product to become available, and in the mean time I would only be able to use it for tinkering purposes and getting used to the platform (they are tremendously inexpensive presently).</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The project maintainer for GNUstep is attempting to gain funding for being able to spend more time working on implementing Cocoa APIs, etc. to bring GNUstep to have greater parity with the analogue OS X implementation.  <br />
<br />
It seems unlikely that he will reach his funding goals, however it would be very nice if that did happen, or at least if there was a surge of activity on GNUstep such that it was the primary environment across the desktop and mobile.<br />
<br />
There are many unique concepts within <a href="http://gnustep.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GNUstep</a> (a spiritual, open source descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">NeXTstep</a>) that enable powerful workflows, however the primary value in supporting this project is the capacity to simultaneously target a multitude of platforms, from iOS, Android, *BSD, Linux, OS X, etc.<br />
<br />
While GNUstep is very unpopular compared to other desktop environments such as KDE and Gnome, it is much more powerful than either of those, especially if it had less parity with OS X's Cocoa APIs.<br />
<br />
And while it is an interesting work environment, its value to developers is even better as it potentially greatly reduces the amount of work required to target multiple environments for an application.<br />
<br />
It is effectively a UI that allows a project to design the interface once and have that available everywhere with minimal modifications per operating system that GNUstep supports.<br />
<br />
That is the grandiose idea anyways and it is implemented to a certain extent, however is it increasingly lagging behind OS X iterations with corresponding changes to the Cocoa APIs, which reduces the utility of the GNUstep project for application developers over time.<br />
<br />
The kickstarter for the project is here: <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/203272607/gnustep-project" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/...nustep-project</a><br />
<br />
A corresponding discussion about the kickstarter and project is on Slashdot: <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/08/13/080219/gnustep-kickstarter-campaign-launched" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://tech.slashdot.org/story/13/08...paign-launched</a> and also on Hacker News: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6202732" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6202732</a><br />
<br />
It would be great if you contributed to the Kickstarter or convinced an employer to do so, arguing that it would reduce development time and cost associated with maintenance for multiple platforms so that hopefully the project's target goal is reached.<br />
<br />
I would finish funding it and throw additional developers at it were I flush with cash to do so as it has many advantages over current offerings, and I would like to move away from OS X myself without sacrificing so much utility when going to KDE or a Gnome environment or some other environment that is not based on NeXTstep.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I have been pondering the state of map data and voice parsing lately.  <br />
<br />
Currently both Nokia and Nuance are relatively cheap to purchase for Google, Apple, or MS, and if Samsung wanted to control Android even more they could purchase them as well.  <br />
<br />
Nuance happens to power Siri, and they make the Dragon Naturally Speaking software, technology which is very imperative to have at a competent level in the context of voice controlled systems, which phones/cars/other stuff may have, and at least at the consumer level there is no competing technology that is as good as what Nuance has.  <br />
<br />
MS licenses Nokia's Here maps (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_%28Nokia%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_%28Nokia%29</a>), which seem to be the best data source outside of what Google has acquired. <br />
<br />
Both Apple and MS are vulnerable to competition in this area, being worse at both search and having worse data available to work with than Google.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the point is that these companies have way more cash than either Nuance or Nokia, need that technology, yet license it rather than just purchasing the company and preventing a potential disaster scenario where a competitor buys the company and they are left scrambling for a nonexistent alternative that isn't terrible, why?<br />
<br />
It seems like both MS and Apple have placed themselves in a precarious position with their mobile offerings by not buying the companies themselves.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Is anyone aware of another environment that supports semantic, structured movement and editing (the environment understands what is being edited and moves and edits within it based on that)? In particular in the context of Python, C, C++, tex, or Matlab/Octave would be nice.<br />
<br />
This exists in the context of lisp languages with paredit (<a href="http://emacsrocks.com/e14.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://emacsrocks.com/e14.html</a>) and redshank (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvPFZL6NJNQ&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=TLmROwYe9Gfak#t=875" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvPF...wYe9Gfak#t=875</a> or <a href="http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/emacs/redshank/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.foldr.org/~michaelw/emacs/redshank/</a>), and they are really brilliant and saves a ton of time. <br />
<br />
Too long, didn't watch summary of those:<br />
<br />
Redshank is more or less refactoring, however it can also do transformations of the code to other forms semantically, which I have seen in other environments to a certain degree but not as ambitious when it comes to transformations.<br />
<br />
Paredit moves within the code and enforces the structure is always valid and sensible and provides a way to move within them fluidly and some transformation functionalities.<br />
<br />
I would love to have something like Paredit and Redshank in other contexts.  As a a hypothetical example, in Python this would allow me to modify and move around variables and arguments, turn functions into the basis of a class or the reverse and do something sensible with the no longer relevant bits turn a REPL session into a test with minimal or no modification.<br />
<br />
Pycharm has some refactoring capabilities but nothing similar to the transformations of similar concepts into another element of that same group like in the way I can transform the scope of arguments/variables etc. with the tools I mentioned for lisp. <br />
<br />
That would save me a lot of time if it exists for any of those languages, but if someone knows of an implementation with similar goals in other contexts that would be very useful as well.  <br />
<br />
A side effect of tools like paredit/redshank is that I notice a context switching cost like in the case where I have to switch from what I am currently doing to digging up the functions that perform the transformations in that environment, so it helps me stay more focused on what I am trying to do as a result.</div>

<br />
Other than 3D printers and DIY hardware, Light Table is the tech I am most excited about.  Provided that is has a a sufficiently open source license and its plugins can modify the entire program, I think it has the potential to pull a lot of emacs users away and be a real iteration on emacs design.  It is sufficiently general that it can cover all of emacs use cases.  <br />
<br />
I am hoping that the plugins are scriptable with clojure script as that is not only a great language (it solves a large amount of JS' design flaws) but also is the language that the app itself is designed in.  It will have the benefit of not only being a great text editor but also great at displaying interactive graphics, very cool.  The next stage is deciding how the plugin system will work, a decision which will make or break the project for myself (the license will as well, but this is the other component to that).<br />
<br />
I hope they go with one extension language instead of trying to address multiple ones like Vim has, something which makes reading and modifying other people's scripts a pain as they are written in everything from vim script to python to lua and also ruby.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Anyone got anything?<br />
<br />
I can up my work desktop from 8 to 16 gigs of ram but I'm still using firefox which doesn't make a legitimate 64 version, so it gets locked down to roughly 2-3gb of usable address space (&lt;4gb max, @1 and change reserved for OS functions)<br />
<br />
This means I could install as much memory as I wanted and it wouldn't improve squat because 32 bit apps can't use anything beyond, well, 32 bits of address space.<br />
<br />
I dislike chrome<br />
<br />
I dislike IE<br />
<br />
I've searched for 64 bit firefox builds, but they're mostly shams unless there's some legacy nightly sitting around from years ago. (I recall they had to cancel their 64 bit build for windows because it was too big to compile or something and I can't run on linux at work)<br />
<br />
The browser wars mean google is glutted with news articles instead of search results.<br />
<br />
I will test any recommendation I can get. (edit -- I should rephrase, today is not april fool's and I get pretty cranky about being fed 0 days, so any BROWSER recommendation within REASON)</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I had/have a real crummy netgear router. I believe it might be the 300 from 6 years ago. It cannot keep a signal for more than 2, sometimes 3 attached wireless devices at a time. It has to be reset on average 4 to 5 times a day. Lately, it has required an hourly reset for any network usage at all. It is time for replacement.<br />
<br />
I previously bought my routers online. Id read that a number of linksys devices could be folashed with a crude form of linux capable of handling more wireless devices than stock software enabled.<br />
<br />
What's the deal? Linksys' newest models have a matrix on the back of the box indicating the level of network performance rating between a (they compare it to a studio apartment) and &quot;d&quot; rating (office or multi family dwelling). What's the deal with this? This sounds like hoorse shit to me. It used to be you measured a router by the number of internal and external antennas and bandwidth it could handle. <br />
<br />
They don't disclose this on the box except the supposed bandwith. 150mbps seems like more than enough bandwidth to me, esp since I'm only on dsl, and don't stream a thing between devices. But this horse shit about the capacity comparison to a studio apartment makes me really worry about how many devices it can antennuate.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I had this thought whilst some people were bitching about Mozilla's Persona implementation, basically lamenting that it was trivial to generate a graph from it due to it tying the login to an e-mail. <br />
<br />
Does such a thing exist that is similar to lastpass but for e-mail addresses?<br />
<br />
Basically I imagine it working like this<br />
<br />
1) Generate a new e-mail address that is tied to the same domain.<br />
2) Associate that with a unique, secure password (lastpass does this)<br />
3) Feed that to the website log-in from the central log-in server<br />
4) User facing log-in to the central log-in server is just one<br />
5) Client side has an app that knows the mapping between each domain and the e-mail address it knows, and smartly uses the correct e-mail address when composing replies so that things don't go haywire<br />
6) The client side only perceives one inbox (methods exist to categorize them into virtual inboxes though)<br />
<br />
Also, this could integrate into a Google Voice type service so that you could effectively have G+ Circles for people, so that  1) they don't know your real phone number and 2) so that automating actions to that was trivial.  <br />
<br />
Currently Google Voice rocks (Google should advertise this more as it is killer IMO and solves a slew of problems), but there is no analogue to gmail's <a href="mailto:type.name@domain.tld">type.name@domain.tld</a> that can indicate where the e-mail is sourced from.  <br />
<br />
I would like that for my phone number somehow so that I could have burner numbers essentially because after x time I could send any calls to that number to /dev/null if I wished for time sensitive interactions.</div>
