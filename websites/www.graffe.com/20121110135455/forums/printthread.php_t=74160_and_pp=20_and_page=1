		<blockquote class="restore">So hitting the rounds today (because he released it yesterday) is Romney's 2011 tax returns.  Of note is his tax rate, 14.1%.  This is of note though not because of how low it is, but because of how high it is.  This is pretty much a no win situation for Romney I believe, but he actually paid more in taxes this year on purpose in order to appeal to voters.  Since claiming more deductions could have brought him below the 13% he claims he's never gone under.  And while that wouldn't suddenly make his prior statement a lie, it would seriously call into question the unreleased taxes he's hiding.<br />
<br />
Here's the kicker though.  When originally pressed about his low tax rate, his response was:<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			I don't pay more than are legally due and frankly if I had paid more than are legally due I don't think I'd be qualified to become president. I'd think people would want me to follow the law and pay only what the tax code requires.

</div>So there you have it, Romney admitting he's not qualified to be president.</blockquote>

</div>And you'd be right. Why invest in American businesses and markets if you're going to have to wait twenty years to see any kind of return? A more moderate solution would be to tax withdrawals at a rate equal to the highest income tax bracket, and reduce the rate ~1% per year until it matches the lowest bracket.<br />
<br />
There is a very reasonable argument against capital gains tax in that it is a &quot;double tax&quot; - you're taxed on the money when you first make it as income, then you're taxed on it again when you invest it. However, there's a point whereupon the wealthiest members of society can actually use their investment returns <i>as</i> income, which is where the lower rate on cap gains ceases to be reasonable and becomes an entitlement. When you factor in the possibility that it's quite likely people are subsisting on investments made with money they never paid income tax on themselves (inheritances, etc.), you run into the crux of the classist society we're devolving into.<br />
<br />
Not that the tax code needs to be any more complicated, but if you don't like the descending rate you could also tax any capital gains income above and beyond actual income at the higher rate, and all other cap gains income at the lower rate. At that point you may even be able to make an argument that any capital gains income less than or equal to regular income could be allowed to not be taxed at all.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">There are 2 things wrong with the &quot;double tax&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
First, you're claiming that the people paying capital gains tax are being double taxed on the income. This is false. Capital gains is the difference between what you paid for the asset (called the &quot;basis&quot;) and what you sold it for. <br />
<br />
Secondly, the people making the loudest stink about capital gains taxes are people who inherited money. <br />
<br />
I claim that there should be no distinction between capital gains and regular income - both should be taxed at the same rate. That's what happened before Reagan.</blockquote>
