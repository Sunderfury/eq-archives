<br />
I did a search for videos with HD, and that button is there and works, but just HQ does not. <br />
<br />
Tried with the different = tricks that should force it to play in HQ that won't work either. <br />
<br />
Searched for videos in HQ, and some of them even have that comment &quot;press HQ for better video / audio&quot; with an arrow towards the place where there is no button.<br />
<br />
I need mah HQ! Where is it?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Ok so if I click on the user, and view the video from there, I get the HQ option. But on a regular youtube search, no option. wth</div>

I have no problems doing a normal daily quest circuit, but for some reason I find these quests to be beyond boring. And no, I'm not jousting mobs that have 3 shields all the time, and then take a VERY long time to die :grinno:</div>

				Oct. 12, 2009  It's the digital equivalent of waving at someone from across a crowded room. <br />
<br />
And yet a Tennessee woman was arrested last month for &quot;poking&quot; another user on Facebook. <br />
<br />
According to an affidavit filed with the Sumner County General Sessions Court on Sept. 25, Shannon D. Jackson of Hendersonville, Tenn., allegedly violated a legal order of protection that had been previously filed against her when she sent a virtual &quot;poke&quot; to another woman on Facebook. <br />
<br />
The Facebook poke feature can be used to convey a variety of meanings, including simply saying &quot;hi&quot; to friends, according to Facebook. When you poke someone, an alert pops up in the corner of that person's Facebook page notifying them of your poke. <br />
<br />
Although Jackson declined to comment, her lawyer, Lawren Lassiter, told ABCNews.com that his client was &quot;extremely shocked&quot; when the police arrested her. <br />
<br />
&quot;The only evidence that I'm aware of is a printout of a screen,&quot; said Lassiter, adding that the printed screen grab of the victim's Facebook page is what led police to determine that the protective order had been breached. &quot;I'm trying to get my hands on some Facebook documentation so we can better assess the situation.&quot; <br />
<br />
Information from Facebook could help verify whether the poke came from Jackson's account or an imposter's, he said. It could also help determine whether or not the poke was made from Jackson's computer or if someone broke into her account. <br />
<br />
Lassiter declined to comment on the events that led to the protective order against his client, but he said that violating an order of protection is a Class A misdemeanor that can be punished with up to 11 months, 29 days in jail. Jackson is scheduled to appear in court later this month. <br />
<br />
The protective order against Jackson, filed on June 10, prohibited her from &quot;telephoning, contacting or otherwise communicating with the petitioner, directly or indirectly,&quot; the affidavit said. The victim named in the affidavit, Dana M. Hannah, did not respond to requests for comment from ABCNews.com. <br />
<br />
<b>Facebook Poke a 'Deliberate Action'</b><br />
<br />
Although &quot;poking&quot; is a somewhat passive and new form of technology-enabled correspondence, Ryan Calo, a residential fellow at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet &amp; Society, said it is still a form of communication restricted by a protective order. <br />
<br />
&quot;A poke is a very deliberate action,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to select the person and say, 'this is what I want to do.'&quot; <br />
<br />
Advances in technology have expanded the spectrum of communication, from low-engagement to high-engagement ways of interacting with others, Calo said. <br />
<br />
This case involving Facebook &quot;poking&quot; is an example of how the law must recognize new and different forms of communication, he said. The digital environment can create new pitfalls and new threats, he added. <br />
<br />
&quot;Protective orders are not always about physical danger, they're often about getting this person out of your attention and getting away from them,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
In recent months, Calo said, there have been similar instances in which a person's virtual actions on social media sites have had legal ramifications. <br />
<br />
In July, a Chicago woman was hit with a $50,000 lawsuit from a local management company after posting a comment on Twitter about her &quot;moldy apartment.&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Last spring sometime, a Windows update added the new desktop search to my XP laptop (Win XP Pro, SP3).  I hated it and disabled it.  That gave me the option to go back to the old Windows search.  It worked fine.<br />
<br />
Now the past few weeks, I've noticed that the old Windows search doesn't work.  If I type *.* as the file filter I get everything.  But if I do any sort of wildcard (*.doc, *.xls, etc.) I get nothing.  Even when I know there are files that meet the criteria.  I can even type in the exact filename and it still won't find the file.<br />
<br />
I know the Windows indexing service can affect that, but these files are all of types that are indexed (or should be anyway).<br />
<br />
Anyone have this problem and know how to correct it?</div>

				I had my first orgasm at the age of 17. I was sitting at my desk at school when all of a sudden, I felt a warm, pulsing feeling in my genital area. My vagina flared up and I couldn't think straight. It was like someone had squeegeed my thoughts away. I was like, whoa, what's that? It felt really erotic and good, but I was also freaked out, scared, and confused. After that, it started happening a few times a day. I searched online for spontaneous orgasms, but all I found was weird porn.<br />
<br />
It kept getting worse. During my second semester of senior year, I counted orgasms on a sheet of paper. I was having 100 and 200 a day. I ran to hide in the bathroom between classes to relieve the pressure.<br />
<br />
By the time I started college, the orgasms became even more intense and disruptive, and I was having trouble concentrating. I became really depressed. I didn't know what was wrong with me, and I wasn't getting any better. I cried a lot. I hid in the bathroom. I became violently protective of my privacy. In the beginning, I told everyone I trusted about my condition. People said things like: &quot;You're so lucky!&quot; and &quot;Dude, I'd love to date you.&quot; They didn't understand why I wanted it to go away, and labeled me a drama queen. The school psychiatrist thought I was crazy. After my sophomore year, I bought a bunch of vibrators and took medical leave.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>While researching new power supplies I started reading about other possible computer upgrades as well. My current system usually plays games on high, but sometimes I have to make compromises (Dawn of War 2). Looking at the system requirements of some upcoming games, and it looks like I might be a little behind on Dragon Age.<br />
<br />
650watt power supply<br />
Dual Core 2 Duo e6600 (2.6 Ghz)<br />
Geforce 8800GT<br />
2gigs ram (was going to upgrade to 4 anyway)<br />
<br />
Now the recommendation for Dragon Age processor wise called for a 2.4Ghz quad, or a 3.0 Ghz dual core. I'm probably good on everything else. Now when I got the e6600, part of the reason why it was so recommended was because it was easy to overclock, something I have never done.<br />
<br />
So as far as I can tell from browsing newegg, my options are:<br />
1) Upgrade both the cpu and the motherboard, probably an i5. 300-400 dollars<br />
2) Upgrade the cpu to a higher class in the same socket (8500 or such). 100-200 dollars<br />
3) Learn to overclock, free, or however much it costs me to repair the fire damage when I mess it up. :p<br />
4) Stop whining and play on low-medium settings. It's not supposed to have particularly impressive graphics anyway.<br />
<br />
A friend suggested I not buy new ram until I upgrade the mobo, since I will have to replace it when I do. I really didn't want to spend too much money at once. None of the options particularly appeal to me. The first one in particular is so much money when you include the RAM that I almost might as well just build a second computer. :confused:</div>
