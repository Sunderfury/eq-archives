<br />
Chapter 1<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I approached the Gray Tower with some trepidation, holding the summons from the Arch Magus in my right hand as if it was a knife.  The Sun was directly overhead as I entered the Tower, a seamless gray obelisk that appeared to have been carved in geometric perfection out of a single megalith of granite.  I had only been in the City of Odun for one night when the messenger had arrived the next morning at breakfast, bearing the summons.  I had not the slightest clue how the Arch Magus even knew I existed, let alone my name and the inn where I was staying.<br />
<br />
As I entered the lobby, my eyes adjusted rapidly to the fairly bright light coming from half a dozen or so floating Wisps rolling around on the ceiling.  At the opposite end of the lobby from the entrance was a counter that covered the middle third of the back wall.  To either side of the counter was the entrance to a corridor.  Behind the counter was a rather pretty raven-haired girl.<br />
<br />
Im Kiril of Honge, here to see the Arch Magus, I smiled at the receptionist.  She had taken my inventory the moment I entered, however, and was obviously not impressed by what she saw.<br />
<br />
Youre expected, please take the corridor to the right, all the way to the door at the end, she said in a tone that implied that I might very well be unable to follow even such a simple bit of direction.  And dont open any of the other doors, even the ground floor of this Tower is filled with dangerous magic.<br />
<br />
I thanked her and proceeded through the entrance shed indicated and down the darkening passageway to the door at the farthest end.  There was no handle or knob, just a painted circle on the side opposite the hinges.  I could see a Glyph protruding from the circle, a Glyph that ran, glowing, just under the surface of the stone and coiled at the top of the door like a spring, obviously a crude mechanism for opening the door.  I pressed the circle and the Glyph uncoiled a bit and the door opened wide.<br />
<br />
The room inside was brightly lit by several Wisps, and contained a large round table with a man sitting at its only chair.  Against the left wall was an unruly pile of wooden chairs of several different designs.  The man seated at the table was one of the tallest Id ever seen, with long spidery arms that ended in huge thin-fingered hands that were holding open a small scroll.<br />
<br />
Kiril of the Mad Eyes, I take it? asked Arch Magus Starn as he rolled up the scroll.  Before I could answer, he gave a little nod and pointed at the haphazardly piled chairs to the side of the room and added Please get yourself a chair from over there and come sit next to me.<br />
<br />
I looked over the pile of chairs, and they all seemed to be Glyphed in one way or another.  One had a Sleep trap in the seat; another had a Flash burst waiting to temporarily blind whoever sat in the chair.  Finally I found a chair that had no magical traps woven into the seat, pulled that one out, and carried it around the table to sit at Arch Magus Starns left hand.<br />
<br />
The Arch Magus, who had been watching me intently since I came in through his door, gave another nod, and said I can see that you can see Glyphs, and you knew to sit to my left, because I keep my offensive spells hanging on the right side of my belt.  It appears that my source was not wrong about you, Kiril of the Mad Eyes.<br />
<br />
He paused, as if waiting for me to respond; but I sat silent, not about to give this strange man the satisfaction of asking him about his source.   After a bit he continued.<br />
<br />
Last night in a dream, my predecessor, Arch Magus Jarn, appeared to me in a dream, bearing a palm leaf.  This was the agreed-upon symbol of our station, which only appears in dreams of great prophetic import.  Old Jarn told me that a great crisis would come upon all the world in the near future, and that I was to seek out a man named Kiril of Honge, also known as Kiril of the Mad Eyes, who would be staying at the Cup &amp; Plate Inn on Old Temple Street.  I was to induct this young man into our Order as an Apprentice, and train him in the magical arts, at my own expense.<br />
<br />
I finally spoke, unable to keep all of the surprise out of my voice: But Im 24 years old, and most Apprentices begin their training at the age of 15!<br />
<br />
Both myself and Jarn are aware of this, I assure you, he replied drily.  But Jarn obviously knew more about you than I do, although my little rumor mill tells me that you are a spear for hire who has a reputation as a strong fighter who has been driven out of several towns for a range of reasons.<br />
<br />
I said nothing, but some hint of a reaction must have showed on my face, because he then chuckled and clapped me on my right shoulder.<br />
<br />
Never mind the rumor mill for a moment.  Why dont you go ahead and tell me the story of you in your own words.  He gestured towards a tray in the middle of the table.  I wouldnt mind a cup of wine about now, would you mind pouring?  Feel free to pour one for yourself; Id not make a man tell tall tales with a dry whistle.<br />
<br />
Id noticed the tray, and had also noticed the most subtly drawn Glyph Id so far encountered, hiding as a bit of detail on the label of the wine bottle.  It seemed to be a Truthspeak Barb, although without a glass to magnify it I could not be sure of that.  I subtly shifted to grasp the bottle with my Shield Hand instead of my Sword Hand, and the Barb failed to so much as scratch my surface as I poured us a couple of generous glasses.  I pretended to go a bit stiff and blurted out the following:<br />
<br />
I was born to a lone spinster who raised chickens and sold eggs, who sold me as Apprentice to a caravan guard company on my Twelfth birthday.  At age 14 I was fired by my Master for fighting with my fellow guards.  Ever since then, I have worked for-hire to anyone who needed a spear for hire.  My banishments have mainly been due to sleeping with the wrong ladies, besting the wrong sons in fisticuffs, and general bad luck.<br />
<br />
Impressive, said the Arch Magus.  You obviously have some way of defeating the Truthspeak Barb.  Or else you would not have conveniently left out that your mother was thought by the townsfolk to have consorted with an Incubus, a sprite from the Plane of Red Life, and that you were believed Uncanny by the locals, and that two of your fellow guards tried to rob and kill you on payday but you wound up killing them instead in the most gruesome way imaginable, and that you are now a suspected thief masquerading as a spear for hire.<br />
<br />
I managed to not spit wine all over the Arch Magus, but barely.  Id long ago learned to keep silent when surprised, so I waited for him to speak again.<br />
<br />
He nodded to himself, as if Id just answered a question to his liking.  But Jarn made me feel like an Apprentice in comparison when he was alive, so I have no doubt that he has the ability even in death to reach me in my dreams.  So I shall do as he instructed, and take you on as an Apprentice.<br />
<br />
What makes you think that I would accept an Apprenticeship in the Magic Arts when I am already a journeyman spear for hire?  Even though I wouldnt dream of letting this opportunity for knowledge and power go by, my question and my curiosity were both genuine.<br />
<br />
The Arch Magus chuckled with a surprisingly bubbly laugh for a graybeard.  In my experience, there are three things that big boys and young men desire above all else: Food, women, and power.  And from what Ive heard, Kiril of the Mad Eyes, youve an exceeding fondness for all three.  Youd sooner go without wenches and beef than to let a chance for more power slip through your grasp.  Ive already sent for your things from the inn, and Karima at the reception desk will have you brought up to your room, where a cold supper will be laid in for you.<br />
<br />
I bent a bit at the waist and spread my hands as if in mock acquiescence to a superior argument.<br />
<br />
One last thing before you go, Kiril of the Mad Eyes:  I have to ask you two questions about your past that no rumor mill can answer.  First, is it true that the two fellow guards who tried to rob and kill you were turned inside-out?  Second, if yes, how did you accomplish that?<br />
<br />
This Arch Magus was too sharp to swindle with a cheap lie, so I opted for the truth.  You said it yourself, I was sired by a denizen of the Fleshworld.  Somehow, at times dictated by certain conditions, such sprites can mold, reshape, sculpt, twist, and design flesh as if it was wet clay.  Somehow the mode of attack those two scoundrels used triggered the conditions that gave me such power over their bodies.  It was as if by attempting to steal my life within the protective circle of our campfire, they had forfeited control over their own by contract.  Somehow, I just knew in my heart that they belonged to me, to do with as I wished.  And I wished them dead.  And it was so.<br />
<br />
And with that I walked out of the room to seek Karima the Receptionist.

							That is an excellent first pass; simple and direct. It conveys the beginnings of a tale well enough that I want to read more, which is the point of all introductions.<br />
<br />
Two things: The first line should be a real grabber, but reads flat.<br />
<br />
Second: Beware the trap of the wise and capable protagonist. Remember that his growth is ultimately what the reader expects to experience vicariously, through your story. Make sure to leave yourself room to stretch him out a bit.<br />

							<center><b>Chapter 2</b></center><br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
I awoke with the Sun in my face.  Karima was stirring beside me in the small cot we shared.  The ceiling of the tiny room, a cell really, showed me a square of ordinary blue morning sky, with a few clouds drifting by and the top of the Sun peeking in from the East end.  Last night had been cloudy and nearly Moonless, so perhaps Id missed falling asleep under the stars with Karima. <br />
<br />
After getting over her surprise at my walking out of that small room with the Arch Magus on my own two feet, shed become more interested in getting to know me it seems.  According to her, very few Apprenticeship interviews end with the interviewee unscathed.  Id talked her into accompanying me to the Cup &amp; Plate to try the delightfully strong beer brewed on the premises by the Lady of the House.  Wed staggered back to my room together some time past Midnight, drunk as poets.<br />
<br />
Anything left of the supper? murmured Karima.  I think we just missed breakfast.  I have to get to work, and you have to get ready for your first lessons.  I expect someone will be along any minute to fetch you.<br />
<br />
Still some bread and kippers here, I waved as I swung my legs off the cot and onto the surprisingly warm floor.  There was a light brown robe hanging on a peg on my wall, with a matching skullcap perched on it, and a pair of matching slippers on the floor beneath.  I suppose Mages dont wear underwear?<br />
<br />
Most of our boys come with a few extra pairs packed by their mothers, she said with a flashing grin.<br />
<br />
Now I know what to do with this big belt hanging by the robe, I exclaimed with a waggle of my brows.  Spank my way to respect!<br />
<br />
She laughed through a mouthful of bread as I pulled the robe on over my head.  I was just adjusting the belts fit when there was a knock at my door.<br />
<br />
Just let yourself out, sweets, I said to Karima as I pecked her on the cheek.  If I survive my first day, I hope to see you again soon.<br />
<br />
The young man at the door was a rather thickly built ginger-haired fellow in a red robe and cap, with pale freckled skin and watery blue eyes.  He introduced himself as Chanz, an 8th-year student who was working as an instructors assistant.  He guided me out of the first floor dormitory area through the mazelike corridors of the Gray Tower until we were at the door of my first Magus instructor, Magus Tern.<br />
<br />
Magus Tern was a short round ball of energy, with cropped dark hair and rings on every finger.  I could see subtle Glyphs woven throughout the jewelry he wore, and the room he was in was filled with what looked like Smithing and Jewelsmithing tools.  One wall had a large slate affixed to it, and Tern bade me attend him at the slate.<br />
<br />
Arch Magus Starn informed me that you already are familiar with Glyphs, and can readily see them.  Can you draw me the Glyph that seals a door against intruders?<br />
<br />
I picked up a block of chalk and drew the Glyph for the Locking Bar, one of the many flat Glyphs Id seen here and there.<br />
<br />
Very close, very close, said Tern approvingly.  He quickly sketched a Locking Bar in one smooth movement, and indeed there were several small differences to my sketch. Now, lets see how you do with the real thing.<br />
<br />
Tern stepped over to a small cabinet and said First, you must visualize pushing out your finger without moving your hand, until you can see a tiny bit of your inner vitae gleaming at the tip.  His extended fingertip began to shine like a candle, and as he moved it, it left a trace behind as if he was drawing in the air.  Now, you try it.<br />
<br />
I held out my finger, willing it to move, to grow, to stretch, anything.  Nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Tern smiled and said No ones ever gotten this on the first try.  Here, try pushing over this coin.  He set a coin on top of the cabinet, so that the coin was on its edge.<br />
<br />
I stood facing the coin, finger outstretched, willing my finger to push over the coin.  I was beginning to feel discouraged when I felt my Sword Hand catch, as if Id been rubbing a bolt of silk and had snagged a rough patch of skin on it.  Suddenly a white rod slipped from my fingertip, knocking the coin onto the floor.<br />
<br />
Excellent! beamed Tern.  Now draw the Locking Bar on the cabinet doors.<br />
<br />
I touched the cabinet doors, and slipped the rod out of my fingertip as if Id been doing it all my life.  As I moved my finger in the shape of the Locking Bar, the rod extending from my fingertip left behind a smear of light, which became the whole Glyph once Id finished.<br />
<br />
Tern grasped the handles to the cabinet, and pulled.  The doors did not budge.  Amazing.  Arch Magus Starn was right, youre going to be taking classes on the Second Level by next week.  Well spend the rest of the morning learning how to draw some of the more useful basic Glyphs, but first, my curiosity is getting the better of me.<br />
<br />
Tern tugged at one of the rings on his left hand, and the Glyph it held activated, sending out a warm cone of greenish light that struck the Locking Bar Id drawn and erased it.  It was the most impressive thing Id seen so far in the Gray Tower, that Nullifying Ring.  It was a famous artifact of the Fall of the Avatars.  Only six were known to exist in all the world.  Then Tern drew his own Locking Bar on the doors.<br />
<br />
Can you open the doors? Tern asked me.<br />
<br />
I sighed.  Once again, these Mages were forcing me to tip my hand, literally this time.  I positioned my Sword Hand and struck at the Glyph with the sharp invisible blade that enveloped my right hand when I willed it.  This was another gift of my unknown father, like its companion, my Shield Hand.<br />
<br />
The Glyph was cut in several places, beyond its capacity for self-repair, and the pieces fell to the floor and writhed and shrank as they sizzled down to nothing.  And then we spent the rest of the day, nay the week, studying and practicing Glyph after Glyph after Glyph.  <br />
<br />
 Magus Tern had decided that I should learn a small but useful collection of Glyphs perfectly by rote, and when I had mastered the curriculum he designed for me, within three weeks, he gave me a present:  A tiny scroll containing the entire First Level Glyph library, which was itself powered by a small persistent Glyph that caused whatever portion of the scroll was unrolled to pop out into a full three-dimensional diagram.  It was a precious gift, and I thanked Magus Tern with genuine heartfelt gratitude.<br />
<br />
 It wasnt until I had moved on to the Second Level that I discovered that Karima was Terns daughter.

Karima and I spent much of my small stock of spare time during my First Level lessons vanishing off to various places where we could spend an evening together away from the Gray Tower.  On the night before I moved on to the Second Level, she and I went to the public house next to the Old Temple Gate at the Northeast corner of the city to hear a traveling scop of some renown named Boril of Honge.  I had heard his brand of spoken word accompanied by his swift finger picking of an eight string lyre back in my home town of Korphils Rest on the outskirts of Honge, and was looking forward to some music from home, as well as Karimas pleasant company.<br />
<br />
The public house was a fine old one, converted from one of the ancient guardhouse pillars of the much-mightier Gate that once divided the now-destroyed Old Temple with the Keep of Odun that had eventually become the City of Odun once men had begun to repopulate the deserted ruins long ago.  The inside of the place was a long, wide, tall rectangular space that was sumptuously lined on three sides by a series of hardwood staircases and balconies filled with overstuffed upholstered chairs that had been bolted together into benches.  The fourth side contained a horseshoe-shaped stage with an orchestra pit inside the arms of the horseshoe.  At the base of the horseshoe, where it passed closest to the audience, sat Boril, cross-legged on the flooring of the stage, tuning his lyre to a base note he blew on the neck of a small bottle that hung from a string around his neck.<br />
<br />
Karima and I found ourselves in a very light crowd, and were able to find a pair of balcony seats on the first level very close to the center without much difficulty.  After wed been seated for a while, and people were no longer arriving in large numbers, Boril began to strum a tune that was at once mechanical and passionate, a tune I recognized as the accompaniment to one of his most famous spoken word pieces, The Story of How.  And then he began to speak it, with his voice melting in our ears like warm butter as the music and his words spun their spell within our minds, and we each saw the images within ourselves of The Story of How as he strummed and spoke:<br />

				In the beginning there was Hell; and Hell was a place where Titans battled endlessly across a void, taking great swathes of territory containing nothing, striving for no known reason.  These Titans were the Avatars of the Six Gods of Mortal Existence, mere manifestations of the actual deities who existed each on their own Planes, manifested for the express purpose of settling once and for all which deity would be the one to rule all of Creation and to demand fealty from the other five gods.<br />
<br />
And one day the Avatars battled into range of the King of Hells castle, and the mere thunder and rattle of their battle was so powerful that the King of Hell was destroyed instantly on his throne.  And with the King of Hells death, Hell became even less substantial, and even more filled with nothingness.  The Avatars, in their battle lust, never noticed their world eroding away around them.  The first to succumb to the destruction of Hell was Earth.<br />
<br />
Earth succumbed to the destruction of Hell, and the Avatar of Earth became the ground that is now beneath our feet.  The remaining five Avatars battled on obliviously, now trampling the body of Earth beneath their feet.  The next to succumb was Water.<br />
<br />
Water fell across Earth, covering Earth in part.  And still the battle raged on between the remaining four.  Next to succumb was Air, who fell atop of Earth and Water.  Then Fire succumbed to the destruction of Hell, and then Fire lay atop of Air, Fires burning corpse illuminating Earth and Water.<br />
<br />
Oh, my sons and daughters of Woman, if only the battle had ceased then!  If only peace had found a way to bring the last two Avatars together in a new world without strife!  But alas, children of Woman, the Avatars of Red and Green Life fought on, without heeding the falling of the other four.  Each was mortally wounded, and made to separate just long enough to catch their breaths, both intending to return to the fight as soon as their strength was regained.  But it was too late.  Their wounds were too great.<br />
<br />
Red Lifes wounds bled droplets of blood, and those droplets became the animals of the world, and Red Lifes tears of pain became Men and Women, from Red Lifes left and right eyes respectively.  And Green Lifes body dried and burst open, scattering seeds and spores around the new world, each of which became a plant.<br />
<br />
And still the battle rages on.  Red Life devours Green Life.  Green Life sets its roots deep into the decay of Red Life.  Should either win the war, that will be the last day that Fire will shine down through Air upon Water and Earth.

</div>Karima and I were both standing up and thrumming our feet on the floor with approval after his masterful conclusion.  Even in mighty Odun, the scops of Honge are without parallel.  Boril spoke five more pieces that evening, and we were so exhausted that I dropped Karima off at her boarding house and went straight home to bed so that I would not begin my Second Level training with a hangover like I did my First Level training.

							<center><b>Chapter 4</b></center><br />
<br />
When I made to get dressed in the morning, I was shocked to find that my robe, cap, and slippers had all changed from a light brown to a light blue.  Apparently, they were Imbued.  I began to wonder how much his dream of dead Jarn had been costing poor Arch Magus Starn.<br />
<br />
Once outside my First Floor dorm chamber, I climbed the stairs to the Second Level for the first time since my arrival at the Gray Tower three weeks ago.  Like everything else in this place, the stairs seemed to have been carved as one out of the native stone, and swept in a spiral around a pillar that was carved with intricate geometric patterns that repeated and themselves formed larger patterns as the eye swept outwards.  Once at the Second Floor&#8217;s delicate exit arch, I paused and drew the Glyph for Seeking, and then I spoke the name of he who was to be sought: &#8220;Chanz.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The Glyph had a loop that had a brightly glowing spot that guided me faithfully through a complex series of turns in the obvious labyrinth beyond the arch.  As soon as I had opened the door to which it led me, and laid eyes on Chanz, the Glyph of Seeking faded away.<br />
<br />
Chanz was one of Magus Tern&#8217;s 8th-year student teachers, having had the honor of completing his 7th year of study by turning in an independent studies scroll to Tern that had somewhat revolutionized Summoning by vastly simplifying the required Protection elements with his discovery that no more than five Glyphs would take effect no matter how many were in place.  Magus Tern had joked once that &#8220;Chanz of Kersiph has saved Mages dozens of minutes!&#8221;  <br />
<br />
&#8220;Good, let&#8217;s get right to work,&#8221; Chanz said briskly as I entered.  &#8220;Draw me the Glyph for Lightning but don&#8217;t activate it.&#8221;<br />
<br />
I drew a passable Glyph of Lightning, and grasped it gingerly so as to not squeeze the activation lines together.  Chanz nodded, and then he drew a Glyph I&#8217;d not yet learned, a spiral tube that doubled back to a part that looked a lot like the door openers on the Gray Tower&#8217;s interior doors.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Can you copy this one?&#8221; he asked me.<br />
<br />
It took a couple of false starts, but eventually my hands learned to do the dance almost on their own, and I almost casually fashioned a near exact copy of the complex Glyph that Chanz had drawn.  Chanz smiled in approval, then he drew his own Glyph of Lightning with one hand in an incredibly deft movement, and then, with exaggerated movements so I could see everything he did, he fitted the Glyph of Lightning neatly into the other Glyph as if it was a hand in a glove.  Then he pointed the tubular narrow double-spiral down the length of the long room (it looked like a walled-off section of corridor, really) and squeezed the activation lines on the Glyph of Lightning.<br />
<br />
A bolt of lightning corkscrewed out of the other Glyph, spiraling straight down the length of the room, where it struck a straw combat practice dummy that was standing in a row of the same at the far wall.  It exploded into a cloud of burning straw, and the two dummies on either side began to smolder from the heat.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Interested in Spells, are you?&#8221; Chanz turned to me and asked with a grin.  &#8220;That was your first Spell.  A small harmless Glyph of Lightning added to a Firing Rail becomes a powerful bolt of lightning directed at a distant target.  The Firing Rail can then be reloaded with any of a number of elemental Glyphs.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Chanz&#8217;s grin was infectious as I quickly drew a Glyph of Frost, loaded it into the Firing Rail, and encased one of the still-smoldering target dummies in a block of solid white.  <br />
<br />
Four weeks later, I had completed Chanz&#8217;s Second Level curriculum, and my belt was hung with an array of useful Spells, and was beginning to look like a Mage, at least, even if an overgrown junior one.<br />
<br />
One morning I awoke and my robe had changed color again, this time to a deep royal blue, and I knew to seek Chanz upon the Third Level of the Gray Tower for the next phase of my instruction.<br />

While I was spending my days with Chanz, I was spending my evenings with Magus Tern, helping him with some big mysterious project he was undertaking at the ruins of the Old Temple.  I helped him erect a shed at a spot hed chosen on the grounds, a place on the side closest to the walls of Odun.  Once the shed was built, I helped him bring all manner of equipment and supplies from his workshop on the First Level of the Gray Tower into the shed, including work benches and tool boxes and stack after stack of ceramic things that looked like oxbows with thick flanges at the ends.  As soon as wed brought over the last of at least three sixes of six arm-length arc-shaped ceramic sculptures, Tern thanked me and told me to go have fun and enjoy the city, for my services would no longer be needed.<br />
<br />
Naturally, I took him up on his offer, and began spending my evenings with Karima, enjoying all of the finer points of Odun together with her, as she knew the city like a lover.  There was no dice den, no party house, no sensual spa that she was not aware of.  And everybody seemed to know Karima wherever we went; yet the reckoning Id been expecting to come, an angry Tern destroying me on the spot for taking advantage of his daughter, never came to pass.  Whatever Magus Tern was doing in the shed wed built, it was keeping him supernally busy.<br />
<br />
The Third Level had me mixing potion bases containing special sympathetic ingredients plus raw vitae, pouring it into vials, and then using a Carrier Glyph to destroy a Spell or Glyph, and dissolving the Carrier Glyph into one of the vials of potion base.  This gave the Spell or Glyph inside the potion easier storage options, plus it could be activated by anyone who drank it, even if they were unable to so much as see a Glyph.  Since poppy milk was so often considered a sympathetic ingredient, I assumed that Mages also loved to drink poppy milk and took any excuse they could.<br />
<br />
Four weeks of Potions instruction, and Chanz told me to expect my robe to be gold colored the next morning.  I climbed to the Fourth Level of the Gray Tower in my gold robe the next day with a medicine pouch filled with potion vials hanging from the left side of my belt.  After finding Chanz in a large square room deep in the maze of the Fourth Level, he set to showing me the basics of drawing a Circle of Protection on the floor.  As long as I stood within that circle, there was very little magic, either human or otherwise, that could do me any harm.  Then Chanz drilled me for two sixes of days in how to draw Glyphs of Control and Glyphs of Summoning.  Finally the day came when he decided that I was ready to draw my first Summoning Circle together with a Summoning Glyph and a Control Glyph outside a Circle of Protection, step into the inner Circle, and activate the entire Spell.<br />
<br />
And that was the day that my idyllic sense of comfort within the Gray Tower was replaced by a growing foreboding, for that was the day that I learned too much.

							<b><center><font size="3">Chapter 6</font></center></b><br />
<br />
Im still not sure why, out of six choices of different bottom-tier sprites, I decided to summon a Swarm of Fleshlings.  Perhaps it was an inward sense of perversity, or, worse, a deep hidden desire to attack my own success.  But it was a Swarm that I chose.<br />
<br />
I drew the Circle of Protection, then the Circle of Summoning, then the Summoning Glyph, and finally five Control Glyphs.  I had chosen Obedience, Fear, Peaceful Means, Lawful, and Truthspeak.  These were commonly used for such low-level instructional Summonses.  <br />
<br />
I stepped into the Protective Circle.  Chanz was standing in his own Protective Circle that hed drawn outside of my Spell.  The room was sealed with Glyphs designed to prevent passage of sprites, in case I somehow fouled up.  I bent down and activated the Summoning spell.<br />
<br />
The air in the room seemed to waver, and from the floor inside the Summoning Circle arose the silhouette of a fat man with no legs and a hundred stunted arms coming out of him, all beneath his two large main arms that protruded normally from his shoulders, so that he looked like a human jellyfish, standing on arm-shaped tendrils.  Then this vision of the Avatar of Flesh broke apart into shards, each of which was a tiny little thumb-sized version of the Avatar of Flesh, which flapped their tiny stunted arms in order to fly like deranged pale bumblebees, in a spiral vortex of tiny Fleshlings.<br />
<br />
Chanz thrummed his feet in appreciation for my successful Summoning.  We shared a triumphant grin as the Swarm of Fleshlings remained within the Summoning Circle instead of flying into our faces and attacking our eyes as Id half-expected them to do.  But then the Swarm of Fleshlings opened all of its tiny mouths at once, and spoke.<br />
<br />
Kiril, Son of Woman, I bear tidings from your Father:  Beware the actions of wise fools!  The rotund one courts the end of all!  All of existence is on the brink of a war of total destruction.  The armies of the Planes are massing to march on your world.  The Avatars seek to return from their Fall, and to conclude their contest.  The new order of existence will be no more if they succeed.  Finally, this  there are factions within the ranks of their thralls that would deny the avatars their desire to return.<br />
<br />
I was not too shocked to ask: Who is my father?<br />
<br />
We bear no names, for when we meet, we are already known to one another.  No labels would suffice, replied the Swarm unhelpfully.  The Swarm was spectacularly unhelpful, being perhaps the most incurious sprite in the entire Fleshworld.  It knew nothing more of my father, of the Plane of Red Lifes preparations for war against the world of men, or of any details about vying factions of sprites.  Eventually I released the Swarm to return to the Fleshworld, and Chanz and I made preparations to Summon a higher level of sprite.<br />
<br />
But apparently my Swarm was the very last time that anyone in the Gray Tower was able to successfully summon any sprite from any of the six Planes.  The Planes were keeping their secrets in the run-up to war.  The capacity to form a contract with the denizens of the Planes had been withdrawn by the powers that ruled within the Planes, it seems.

 <br />
After spending the rest of the morning attempting to Summon any sprite from any Plane and failing every attempt, Chanz went to seek the Arch Magus to tell him what had occurred:  we had received a dire warning of a Planar war upon the world of men, and after that all communications between our world and the Planes had been cut off.  I last saw Chanz running up the stairway towards the Ninth Level, where the Magi had their offices and apartments, taking the stairs two and three at a time.<br />
 <br />
I myself headed downstairs, intending to head over to the Cup &amp; Plate for a mug or two of their strongest beer.  I stopped for a few moments to talk to Karima at the reception desk, and while we were making small talk Magus Tern walked in from the front entrance, looking distracted and disheveled.<br />
 <br />
&#8220;Magus Tern!&#8221; I called to him as he passed.   &#8220;Have you a moment to speak?&#8221;  I intended to tell him the events of the morning, as he was Arch Magus Starn&#8217;s closest advisor.<br />
 <br />
&#8220;Sorry, my boy, but I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m positively overwhelmed at the moment, it will have to wait,&#8221; Tern said, rubbing his chest nervously and glancing down the hallway towards the staircase.<br />
 <br />
&#8220;Is there anything I can do to help?&#8221; I asked. <br />
 <br />
He looked at me as if he had only just recognized me.  &#8220;That&#8217;s very thoughtful of you, Kiril, but I&#8217;m afraid that only my, uh, collaborators can assist me at this phase of the project, and I haven&#8217;t been able to, erm, reach them today.  Very thoughtful of you&#8230;&#8221; he trailed off, and then suddenly began walking briskly to the stairs as if he&#8217;d forgotten he was in conversation.  Karima and I watched him disappear around the corner, both of us with concerned expressions on our faces.  I took my leave of Karima and went over to the Cup &amp; Plate and managed to relax enough to lose two silver pieces playing darts with one of the local punters. <br />
 <br />
I awoke the next morning to a banging on my door that made my head feel like it was being hammered on instead of the thick wooden door.   Chanz had come to tell me that my morning&#8217;s lesson had been canceled, but told me that he was not allowed to speak of yesterday&#8217;s events with anyone other than the Gray Tower&#8217;s faculty.<br />
 <br />
Since the Summoning lessons of the Fourth Level had been rendered impossible by circumstance, Chanz advanced me to the Fifth Level, my robe changing to a smoky orange color.  I no longer had the sense of happy satisfaction that a change in robe color had brought me, though, because of the news that had been delivered to me by the Swarm of Fleshlings.  A foreboding of war against the very order of existence has a way of coming between a man and his happiness.<br />
 <br />
My first morning on the Fifth Level, I was to seek my new instructor, the Gray Tower&#8217;s official Instructor in the Arts of Defense and Offense.  I was told his name only, which was Chalarn.  After the Glyph of Seeking had led me to Chalarn&#8217;s classroom, I found the inside to be a large square open space with workbenches and tall work stools on all four walls, everywhere but the doorway. <br />
 <br />
The slender dark-haired man who the Seeker&#8217;s loop had indicated was Chalarn was standing near the center of the room, facing a tall nervous-looking teen.  He turned towards me when I walked through the doorway, to the visible relief of the teen.<br />
<br />
&#8220;You must be Kiril.  Welcome to the Fifth Level, where we instruct our pupils in the Defensive and Offensive Arts.  Please find yourself an empty seat and observe, I&#8217;ve put Glyphs of Limiting on our Firing Rails, and my opponent and I are going to exchange fire until one of us fails to avoid being hit.  Be aware that at least one bystander is hit in every one of these sparring matches, nobody in this room is safe from pain.&#8221;  He smiled coldly, and turned back towards the teen, who gulped visibly and clutched his capped Firing Rail miserably.<br />
<br />
I hastened to the nearest empty work stool, leaning my back against the workbench behind me as I settled in to watch the match.  I was surprised to see that I recognized one of the boys seated around the room as a rather unpleasant bully from my own home town of Korphil&#8217;s Rest.<br />
<br />
Magus Chalarn saluted the teen, who returned the salute with far less grace.  As the teen saluted, I saw clearly that he was already attacking by noting the familiar thoughtless rictus I&#8217;d seen on at least a hundred faces in my short career as a Spear for Hire.  I looked at his left hand, and the sneaky little bastard was holding it not by the double-spiral barrel, as the left hand would normally have done, but was instead holding the part normally gripped by the right hand, and had raised the barrel enough so that it was aimed at Chalarn&#8217;s slippers.  At that moment, just as he was lowering his right hand from the salute, the teen fired a bolt of flame at Chalarn&#8217;s feet, but Chalarn had somehow gotten his Firing Rail into position one-handed as well, and had fired a bolt of frost at the same moment, and the two bolts struck each other a few feet from Chalarn&#8217;s toes, so that all that struck Chalarn was a puff of water vapor.<br />
<br />
The match was now a foregone conclusion, as Magus Chalarn drew a Glyph of Lightning so rapidly that he had it loaded into his Firing Rail before the teen had finished drawing his Glyph of Stone, and the teen went down to his knees wrapped in writhing serpents of lightning.  The entire match had lasted for perhaps four seconds.  That was the longest match of the morning, and Magus Chalarn lectured each fallen opponent on exactly where they had gone wrong and exactly how they could have gotten a lick in first.  I had not yet had my turn in the center of the room with Chalarn when we broke for lunch.<br />
<br />
In the First Level outside of the student dormitory area was the student Dining Hall.  The food was unremarkable, but I took most of my midday meals there out of convenience.  As I approached the entrance to the Dining Hall, I heard a voice behind me call my name: &#8220;Kiril of the Mad Eyes!&#8221;<br />
 <br />
I turned, and after a moment I recognized one of the two who approached me as Ferril of Honge, a boy from my home town who I had noticed at class.  The other boy had been one of the boys who had sparred with Magus Chalarn that morning.  I remembered his name as being something like Kerinern, obviously a native of Odun.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Hello, Ferril, why so formal?  You can just call me Kiril.&#8221; I said coolly.  We had never gotten along when we were lads, when I&#8217;d been sold as a Guard&#8217;s Apprentice I&#8217;d been relieved to have gotten out of Korphil&#8217;s Rest before I&#8217;d wound up killing Ferril.  I was not happy to see him now, familiar face from home or not.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t I just call you Uncanny,&#8221; Ferril sneered.  He and Kerinern exchanged a look that my trained eyes recognized as pack hunting communication.  Kerinern began to walk, ostensibly towards the Dining Hall, but he had that rictus on his face that spoke of an intent other than dining.  I split my attention between the two, and when Kerinern turned back towards me, raising an uncapped Firing Rail, Ferril also raised his Firing Rail, which had obviously had its Glyph of Limiting removed.<br />
<br />
I raised my Shield Hand towards the barrel of Kerinern&#8217;s Firing Rail, and when he fired a missile of stone at me, it bounced harmlessly off of my palm and fell to the floor.  I was swinging my Sword Hand upwards towards Ferril&#8217;s Firing Rail, and before he got it pulled up into an angle that had a chance of striking my lower body, my Sword Hand sliced his Firing Rail in two, and all of a sudden Ferril was holding nothing but a bare and harmless Glyph of Lightning, and his Firing Rail was in sizzling flapping pieces on the ground, dissolving into nothing as I balled my right hand into an ordinary fist and slammed Ferril in the left temple, stunning him and dropping him to his hands and knees. <br />
 <br />
Kerinern was in the middle of drawing a Glyph of Lightning when my slippered foot caught him square in the balls, and while both of them were on the floor like a pair of babes, I walked into the Dining Hall and had a rather mediocre lunch.

I am putting this up in a place where it won't potentially cause bandwidth issues down the line.  Google can pick up the tab and you can still read it as it's being posted.  Blogger is a pretty decent version of Soundcloud for writing, I can host my stuff there and just let you know about new projects the same way I link new songs when I produce them.  Hosting content can get expensive real quick, and you never know what is going to drive up hits.
