Can anyone here give some pointers?   We are able to take down teh 3 waves and the mini's with no problems and engage corinav with 2-3 minutes left each time, but then all heck breaks loose and we all die or gte banished...

<br />
I've heard that you can kill 2 of them and root the 3rd and the babies won't pop by Corinav, but he will be a bit tougher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qinen</div><div class="date">September 10th, 2004, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild recently succeeded against Coirnav for the first time.  We used the AE on the waves, with minis being keep out of AE camp.  Then we took down all 3 minis.  Out understanding is that Coirnav is significantly harder (to the point where you should take out the last mini) if any are still alive.  And yes, its a zerg against Coirnav at the end.  The babies are supposed to despawn when Coirnav dies.  Although, I think I remember there being a couple of mobs (not sure if they were the babies or not) we had to kill after Coirnav went down.  Hope that helps.  I also think we had some kiters trying to keep the babies occupied, but don't quote me on that, as I was busy trying to maximize my dps at the time, hehe.</div></div><hr />

Have someone pretarget Coirnav for you boomers and you can assist and nuke from outside his pen.  Only thing to worry about is getting summoned.</div></div><hr />
