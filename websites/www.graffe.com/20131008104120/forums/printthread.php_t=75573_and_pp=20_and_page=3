			The problem with that is that those higher up in the chain of command did precisely the same thing, and that the only one who is being prosecuted is Manning.

</div>Negative. Manning is the only one that sent out the info.  And he was charged for that.  But others in that intel chain / unit should also be charged with allowing this to happen in the first place.  And I have not seen any news on that, and my google fu has failed me.  But with how shitty the media is on getting all the info out, and how well the military like to keep it's internal trials private,  the public may never know.<br />
<br />
Also the military has its own laws, so your drug story doesn't fit.  Releasing uncleared intel (secret) info is a big no no,  no matter what that info is.  Giving a pass or slap on the wrist for this would set a bad precedent for internal military protocol.</blockquote>

			<div class="message">Executing an entire civilian family that's been tied up is &quot;collateral damage?&quot;  Also, the Crazyhorse8 tape proves that the very Rules of Engagement themselves were totally borked.  And since when is secret bombing in Yemen not a high crime going all the way to the top of the chain of command?<br />
 <br />
And if all of that stuff is just &quot;what happens in war,&quot; then the public had very damned well better know about all of it because we're the ones voting for the dudes who started the war and we're paying for it.  Why would you argue otherwise?  We deserve to know the FULL price of this war, to better gauge whether or not to have a few more like it in the near future.</div>

</div>Actually they are not even collateral,  Any male of military age is considered a potential insurgent to the US government.<br />

Also the CIA likes to murder first responders.<br />

</div>I thought the general trend was towards us folks being pissed because the military is violating THEIR OWN CODE OF LAW.  Which makes them essentially a lawless heavily-armed group that MIGHT eventually be turned on the USA itself, when the feds start naming Americans inside the USA as &quot;Insurgents.&quot;</blockquote>

</div>It's a big concern.  Proper oversight from congress would be ideal (and the way it is supposed to work), but we seem to be getting a bunch of people elected that either do not care about anything except getting re-elected, or are suspect of having a IQ below room temperature and would not comprehend what is going on anyways.</blockquote>

Back then there was a system in place that could correct the serious issues, right now when anyone tries to do that it's all down to &quot;You try and tell that to the victims of 9/11 You Bastard!&quot;.<br />
