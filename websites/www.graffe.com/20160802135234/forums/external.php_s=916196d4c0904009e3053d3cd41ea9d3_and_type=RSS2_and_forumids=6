			Disney is moving forward on a remake of the 1984 film Splash with an interesting twist: Channing Tatum will star as the mermaid character that was played by Daryl Hannah, while Jillian Bell will play the character originally played by Tom Hanks.<br />
<br />
Imagine Entertainment’s Ron Howard and Brian Grazer will produce along with Tatum, Reid Carolin and Peter Kieran via their Free Association banner. Anna Culp will executive produce.<br />
<br />
The 1984 original movie starred Hanks as a man who as a young boy was saved from drowning by a mermaid (Hannah). The mermaid returns 20 years later and finds the boy she once saved, and gives him the option between his life on land or a life under the sea with her.

			A Syrian rescue service operating in rebel-held territory said on Tuesday a helicopter dropped containers of toxic gas overnight on a town close to where a Russian military helicopter was shot down hours earlier. <br />
<br />
A spokesman for Syria Civil Defence told Reuters that 33 people, mostly women and children, were affected by the gas in Saraqeb. <br />
<br />
The group, which describes itself as a neutral band of search and rescue volunteers, posted a video on YouTube purportedly showing a number of men struggling to breathe and being given oxygen masks by people in civil defense uniforms.<br />
<br />
Syria Civil Defence workers, who went to the scene of the attack, said they suspected it was chlorine but could not verify that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Medium-sized barrels fell containing toxic gasses. The Syrian Civil Defence was not able to determine the type of the gas,&quot; said the spokesman.<br />
 <br />
The Syrian government and its Russian allies were not immediately available for comment. <br />
<br />
Both government and opposition forces have denied using chemical weapons during the five-year-old civil war. Western powers say the government has been responsible for chlorine and other chemical attacks. The Syrian government and Russia have accused rebel forces of using poison gas.<br />
<br />
Monitors at the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said barrel bombs fell on Saraqeb late on Monday, injuring a large number of citizens.<br />
 <br />
Russia's defense ministry said a Russian helicopter was shot down near Saraqeb on Monday, killing all five people on board, in the biggest officially acknowledged loss of life for Russian forces since they started operations in Syria.<br />
<br />
The helicopter came down in Idlib province, roughly mid-way between Aleppo and the Russian air force base at Khmeimim, near the Mediterranean coast. <br />
 <br />
The Russian defense ministry said the Mi-8 military transport helicopter had been shot down after delivering humanitarian aid to the city of Aleppo as it made its way back to Russia's main air base in the western province of Latakia.<br />
<br />
No group has claimed responsibility for shooting down the helicopter.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><i>Below is the statement released by John McCain’s reelection campaign on Donald Trump’s comments about Khizr and Ghazala Khan.</i> <br />
“The Republican Party I know and love is the party of Abraham  Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Ronald Reagan.<br />
  “I wear a bracelet bearing the name of a fallen hero, Matthew Stanley,  which his mother, Lynn, gave me in 2007, at a town hall meeting in  Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. His memory and the memory of our great leaders  deserve better from me.<br />
       “In recent days, Donald Trump disparaged a fallen soldier’s parents.  He has suggested that the likes of their son should not be allowed in  the United States — to say nothing of entering its service. I cannot  emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump’s statement. I  hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of  our Republican Party, its officers, or candidates.<br />
 “Make no  mistake: I do not valorize our military out of some unfamiliar instinct.  I grew up in a military family, and have my own record of service, and  have stayed closely engaged with our armed forces throughout my public  career. In the American system, the military has value only inasmuch as  it protects and defends the liberties of the people.<br />
 “My father  was a career naval officer, as was his father. For hundreds of years,  every generation of McCains has served the United States in uniform.<br />
  	 				<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/08/01/mccain-issues-lengthy-rebuke-trump-over-khan-comments/QNlxh9bJoERhQ7MYVFGUQJ/story.html?p1=Article_Related_Box_Article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> 							 							 									<img src="http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_371w/Boston/2011-2020/2016/08/01/BostonGlobe.com/Politics/Images/1a72a2cde7bf4c8eb4f30bc122656900-1a72a2cde7bf4c8eb4f30bc122656900-0.jpg" border="0" alt="" /> 									 										 											 											View Story 										<br />
 								<br />
 																	 										<b>McCain rebukes Trump over Khan comments</b><br /><br /> 										John McCain joined a  bipartisan chorus of voices criticizing Donald Trump for his remarks on  the parents of a Muslim soldier killed in combat.<br />
 										<br />
		 							<br />
 						</a> 					 	   “My sons serve today, and I’m proud of them. My youngest served in  the war that claimed Captain Khan’s life as well as in Afghanistan. I  want them to be proud of me. I want to do the right thing by them and  their comrades.<br />
 “Humayun Khan did exactly that — and he did it  for all the right reasons. This accomplished young man was not driven to  service as a United States Army officer because he was compelled to by  any material need. He was inspired as a young man by his reading of  Thomas Jefferson — and he wanted to give back to the country that had  taken him and his parents in as immigrants when he was only two years  old.<br />
        “Captain Khan’s death in Iraq, on June 8th, 2004, was a shining  example of the valor and bravery inculcated into our military. When a  suicide bomber accelerated his vehicle toward a facility with hundreds  of American soldiers, Captain Khan ordered his subordinates away from  the danger.<br />
 “Then he ran toward it.<br />
 “The suicide bomber,  striking prematurely, claimed the life of Captain Khan — and Captain  Khan, through his selfless action and sacrifice, saved the lives of  hundreds of his brothers and sisters.<br />
 “Scripture tells us that ‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’<br />
  “Captain Humayun Khan of the United States Army showed in his final  moments that he was filled and motivated by this love. His name will  live forever in American memory, as an example of true American  greatness.<br />
 “In the end, I am morally bound to speak only to the  things that command my allegiance, and to which I have dedicated my  life’s work: the Republican Party, and more importantly, the United  States of America. I will not refrain from doing my utmost by those  lights simply because it may benefit others with whom I disagree.<br />
  “I claim no moral superiority over Donald Trump. I have a long and  well-known public and private record for which I will have to answer at  the Final Judgment, and I repose my hope in the promise of mercy and the  moderation of age. I challenge the nominee to set the example for what  our country can and should represent.<br />
 “Arizona is watching. It is  time for Donald Trump to set the example for our country and the future  of the Republican Party. While our Party has bestowed upon him the  nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those  who are the best among us.<br />
 “Lastly, I’d like to say to Mr. and  Mrs. Khan: thank you for immigrating to America. We’re a better country  because of you. And you are certainly right; your son was the best of  America, and the memory of his sacrifice will make us a better nation –  and he will never be forgotten.”</div>

			Nathanial Johnson had grown tired of the burglaries at his mobile home in the small town of Leroy, Ala., about 60 miles north of Mobile.<br />
<br />
So the 68-year-old decided to take matters into his own hands Friday night by springing a trap, Washington County Sheriff Richard Stringer told Fox affiliate WALA-TV.<br />
<br />
In an attempt to make it look like nobody was home, Johnson parked his vehicle at a neighbor’s home and returned to his abode and waited, according to Al.com.<br />
<br />
Sitting near his back door, Johnson told police, he turned the lights off and placed a car mirror near a window so he could see what was happening outside, according to WALA.<br />
<br />
Johnson told authorities that someone knocked on his front door before midnight, Al.com reported. Johnson did not answer and continued to wait as he heard the person move to the back door and break the lock, Al.com reported.<br />
<br />
Johnson told police that he confronted the person, prompting the suspected burglar to fall or jump off the back steps, Al.com reported.<br />
<br />
Johnson subdued the man once he was on the ground and tied his hands behind his back, police told Al.com. The man was later identified as 31-year-old Cleveland Jones Gully.<br />
<br />
Police said that after restraining Gully’s hands, Johnson placed duct tape over his mouth and tied the man to a tree using rudimentary materials — electrical wire, rope from a clothesline and masking tape.<br />
<br />
“He began to tie him to the tree still in the standing-up position,” Stringer told WALA, noting that Johnson used “multiple layers of masking tape that he had wrapped around his mouth and all the way around his head.”<br />
<br />
With the alleged intruder tied to a tree, Johnson told police, he returned to his neighbor’s house to alert police.<br />
<br />
Gully “was still alive at that point, and there was no indication that he was dying,” Stringer told Al.com.<br />
<br />
But when sheriff’s deputies arrived at Johnson’s home 10 minutes later, Stringer said, Gully was dead.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think he was intending to kill the intruder,” Stringer told WALA. “I think he wanted to capture him and have him arrested.”<br />
<br />
Stringer told AL.com that Gully — who lives nearby and had a reputation for breaking into homes — had cuts around his body from the wire used to tie him up but no other visible injuries. Johnson was not armed with a weapon at the time, Stringer said.<br />
<br />
Johnson’s niece, Simone Johnson, told WALA that Gully’s death has left many people in pain.<br />
<br />
“He doesn’t bother anybody,” she said, referring to her uncle. “He’ll help you if you need helping, so the family just hates what happened. I know the other guy. His family is hurting, too, but we are also and we hate that, and I hope that we can just get this resolved soon.”<br />
<br />
The alleged intruder’s uncle, Michael Gully, told WALA that he was shocked by the allegations leveled against his relative.<br />
<br />
“I was surprised that it happened,” he said. “He just wasn’t a violent person that I know of.”<br />
<br />
Stringer told WALA that Johnson is not facing criminal charges while authorities await the results of an autopsy that will determine the cause of Gully’s death.<br />
<br />
Police held him in custody for 72 hours, the station reported.<br />
<br />
“We will probably present it to the grand jury to see what they say about it,” he added.

			Stephen Cebula was wrapped up in the online adventures of “Heroes of the Storm” when he apparently decided to deliver a message to his foes.<br />
<br />
And that’s how the 28-year-old Sacramento gamer found himself facing federal charges Thursday of threatening to visit Blizzard Entertainment’s headquarters with an AK-47, according to a 33-page federal indictment.  <br />
<br />
In one threat, U.S. District Court records show, he wrote: “Careful Blizzard … I live in California and your headquarters is here in California … You keep silencing me in Heroes of the Storm and I may or may not pay you a visit with an AK 47 amongst some other ‘fun’ tools.”<br />
<br />
Cebula, who was arrested July 12, told investigators he sent threats to the Irvine-based company and other players through his Facebook account because he wanted “to scare” them, FBI Special Agent Brady Cowan wrote in a federal criminal complaint.<br />
<br />
Cebula said he looked up the gaming company’s address online and mentioned it in one of his threats “to give them a sinking feeling that they should be worried,” Cowan said.<br />
<br />
Prosecutor say Cebula also wrote: “You keep silencing people in heroes of the storm and someone who may live in California might be inclined to ‘cause a disturbance’ at your headquarters in California with an AK47 and a few other ‘opportunistic tools’ ... It would be a shame to [anger] the wrong person. Do you not agree blizzard?”<br />
<br />
Cebula told federal investigators the term “opportunistic tools” was designed to “let their minds wander” and the reference to using an AK-47 was “because it seemed like the scariest weapon,” Cowan said.<br />
<br />
If convicted, Cebula faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

			Author's note: the Emma Mine Scandal really happened! Trying to pawn off a worn out mine as one loaded with silver to British investors caused an enormous furore. Some of the investors were ruined and helped play into a series of events such as the &quot;USA Coinage Act of 1873&quot; that lead to a world wide depression. $1.5 million then is worth about $150 million now, and actually, because of the way economics work, the amount of &quot;power&quot;, the effect that amount of money had was greater back then as there were less millionaires etc. So it nearly did trigger a very severe diplomatic break, even a war with the British Empire.<br />
<br />
While I have no issue with the Mormon faith, the historic facts do not paint Brigham Young well at all. Every religion has it's leaders who veered far from the path, people should be honest and admit such, we're all just Human. I'm not unjustly attacking Brigham's character, a mixed race person like the fictional Marienne would have very good reason to loathe him. Check the history, I'm actually veering towards a less malign take on the man than evidence suggests.<br />
<br />
The history of the Federal government's attacks on the Mormon faith are also clear, also it's lust for land, and all kinds of corruption, dirty tricks etc.<br />
<br />
So people do need to realize that while there were good individuals, the various &quot;sides&quot;, as usual throughout history in any country, culture or religion, were riddled with scumbags, &quot;jobs worthies&quot; and morons who wanted power and often got it, to everyone else's detriment. That's Human Nature
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Marienne is a mixed race female character from New Orleans who's' husband ended up getting killed in Salt Lake City by a non-Mormon in a racist attack (Brigham repeatedly castigated mixed race marriages and even said such people should be killed, so he made miscegenation a real tinderbox issue, hence Marienne would almost certainly loathe Brigham)<br />
<br />
this may break from the narrative, but I want to show some of the history and explain I'm not biased against Brigham portraying him as a racist, misogynist, political &quot;chancer&quot; who became rich because of his bullying and &quot;insider trading&quot; because that's what he WAS<br />
<br />
or should I just leave that author's note out ya think?</div>

			A teacher in Florida is suing the Miami-Dade County School Board for race discrimination after she was turned down for a position in the district’s Extended Foreign Language program because she does not speak a foreign language. ¡Ay! ¡Esta guera es loca!<br />
<br />
Tracy Rosner, a non-Spanish-speaking third grade teacher at Coral Reef Elementary in Palmetto Bay, Florida, requested to fill a language arts position that requires teachers to teach one hour of Spanish a day. According to her lawyers, Rosner felt that another instructor could assume responsibilities over the Spanish-teaching portion of the class, while she would focus on reading and writing. The Miami-Dade County School Board did not agree.<br />
<br />
After being passed over for the job, Rosner—who is white—filed a federal employment discrimination lawsuit against the board, with her lawyers claiming that she was turned down “because of her race and national origin as a Non-Hispanic individual who was not a fluent and native Spanish-speaker.” <br />
<br />
The Guardian reports:<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			The lawsuit claims that because non-Spanish speakers are in the minority population of Miami-Dade County – where census data shows that about two-thirds of the area’s population are Latino or Hispanic – denying Rosner because she does not speak Spanish amounts to “employment discrimination on the basis of race and national origin.”
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Her lawyers told The Miami New Times in a statement that, “The EFL program has a one-hour Spanish component per day that can be taught by any teacher in the program, and not exclusively the English Reading and Comprehension teacher.” <br />
<br />
I can’t wait to sue the next job that requires proficiency in Excel when I do not—and WILL NOT—gain proficiency in Excel.

Date:July 26, 2016 Source:Columbia University Medical Center <br />
<br />
Summary: People with non-celiac wheat sensitivity have a weakened intestinal barrier, which leads to a systemic immune response after ingesting wheat and related cereals, new research confirms.
