			Wait, are we still talking about the Treasury Department minting a trillion-dollar coin to put off the debate on the debt ceiling for a little while longer? How likely is it that Republicans would make political hay out of such a maneuver for the next decade, castigating the Democrats as the party that simply invents money in order to solve serious fiscal problems? And if we are placing orders for novelty coins, might I request one that properly honors the contributions to American society of Clinton Riggs, the Tulsa, Oklahoma police officer who invented the yield sign? I think that coin should be worth 1.7 gazillion dollars and bestow on the bearer the right to ignore all traffic signals. <br />
<br />
You could ponder this, or simply read this smart and funny analysis by my colleague Mark Gongloff, who as you will see is still trying to impress his 10th grade English literature teacher (Way too late to change that grade, Mark).<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank You America.&quot; That's the slogan from AIG's advertising campaign as it seeks to restore its reputation after . . . um, oh, right nearly destroying the world economy. The insurer, which took $182 billion in taxpayer money at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, is pondering joining a $25 billion shareholder lawsuit against the U.S. government that claims the terms of the bailout were too tough. <br />
<br />
This is like loading a yacht with crocodiles -- because crocodiles are a great long-term investment, you know, in demand all over the world, especially for some reason in Germany -- sailing to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, then abandoning ship after those crocodiles eat your crew and gnaw a hole in your hull (the hull is the bottom, right?). So anyway, there you are, adrift, with crocodile bites all over your legs, clinging to a deflating life raft, also filled with crocodiles (WHY WOULD YOU BRING CROCODILES WITH YOU IN THE RAFT?) -- when the entire U.S. Navy steams up, pulls you from the water, and deposits you on shore. You survive, are given money to revive your crocodile-export company (provided you take some minor steps to make it a little bit more safe), but then: well, you ponder joining a shareholder lawsuit against your savior. <br />
<br />
The whole thing is being orchestrated by former AIG chief, and king of the crocodiles, Hank Greenberg, by the way. <br />
<br />
It's been many years since we could say this, but the housing market is helping to drive the economy again. Mortgage applications for the week ending Jan. 4 shot up 11.7 percent according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, Housing Wire reports. Refinancings are also up, as are interest rates on mortgages, though by just a tad. The housing bubble is dead, long live the housing bubble

It's been almost five years since AIG's stock dropped 60 percent in a day leaving the company doomed to failure, when Uncle Sam swooped in with $182 billion to rescue it. But AIG must have a short memory, because on Monday night news emerged that the insurance company is actually thinking about suing the U.S. government over the bailout that saved it. The board will discuss the idea with shareholders at a meeting on Wednesday.<br />
RELATED: The U.S. Made $22 Billion Bailing Out AIG<br />
It's not so much that AIG's mad the government bailed them out. (They wouldn't be around to be mad if it hadn't.) They just wish they'd done it a little bit differently. &quot;The lawsuit does not argue that government help was not needed,&quot; The New York Times reports. &quot;It contends that the onerous nature of the rescue -- the taking of what became a 92 percent stake in the company, the deal's high interest rates and the funneling of billions to the insurer's Wall Street clients -- deprived shareholders of tens of billions of dollars and violated the Fifth Amendment, which prohibits the taking of private property for 'public use, without just compensation.'&quot; Does that kind of bad attitude count as &quot;looking the gift horse in the mouth&quot; or &quot;biting the hand that feeds you?&quot; Or both?<br />
RELATED: The Treasury Is Getting Out of the AIG Business, Almost<br />
The timing of AIG's potential lawsuit is a little bit curious. The company just finished paying the government back about a month ago, when the Treasury Department announced the sale of its last batch of AIG shares -- at a profit nonetheless. Then a week ago, AIG launched a rah-rah ad campaign with the tagline &quot;Thank You America&quot; to show just how much it appreciates taxpayers saving its butt.<br />
RELATED: Bernie Madoff Calls Himself a 'Human Pinata'<br />
But that's not the message that suing the government for putting up the cash sends, is it? A professor of law and finance at the University of San Diego told The Times, &quot;On the one hand, from a corporate governance perspective, it appears they're being extra cautious and careful. On the other hand, it's a slap in the face to the taxpayer and the government.&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>CES is coming up this week, I believe, and one of the first cool new things I've seen people talking about is Nvidia's new handheld gaming device. <a href="http://shield.nvidia.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://shield.nvidia.com/</a><br />
<br />
It looks like a standard dual stick console controller with a small screen attached. It comes with android installed, but I think it's primary intent is going to be to stream games from a gaming PC, essentially taking your PC with you wherever you go. Steam and their new &quot;Big Picture mode&quot; is mentioned specifically, and I wonder if this is the project Valve has not been talking about.<br />
<br />
It bears a resemblance to OnLive, which was a great idea that sort of petered out for various reasons. The tech geeks on the forum I saw this on seem to be excited about Nvidia's streaming solution, but I know absolutely nothing about it.<br />
<br />
As cool and daring as this is, I have to wonder if there is a market for such a device. If you want a portable gaming machine you are likely to get one with exclusive games, if you hate consoles and only play on PCs, you probably aren't going to want to give up keyboard and mouse for a gamepad.<br />
<br />
So I know there are a lot of you that don't like portables, or only play games on the PC. Would this interest you? What would your pricepoint be? <br />
<br />
I can't see paying more than $100 myself, but doubt it will go lower than $200, possibly more. And there is the one small caveat that you need a kepler based gpu to host the games on in the first place (kepler is their newest line, the 660s or whatever).</div>

A lone Marin drivers naughty sneak into the carpool lane could spell the end of corporate personhood as we know itor at least thats San Rafael resident Jonathan Friemans plan, as he heads to Marin Superior Court next week to challenge a traffic violation and, ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Courts Citizens United decision.<br />
<br />
Frieman was heading south on Highway 101 through Novato on Oct. 2 when he was cited for violating California vehicle code 21655.5, which prohibits drivers from entering unauthorized vehicle lanesin Friemans case, being a solo occupant in a lane requiring two or more persons. But Frieman plans to contest the $478 violation in court on Jan. 7, arguing that he had corporate incorporation papers in his car at the time and, he says, the state vehicle code views corporations as personstherefore he and his corporation constituted a two-person carpool.<br />
<br />
According to a press release from Kathleen Russell Consulting, the Mill Valley-based firm handling publicity for Friemans quest for justice, state vehicle code 470s definition of a person includes natural persons and corporations.<br />
<br />
If he loses in court on Monday, continues the press release, Frieman says he is prepared to appeal the ca se all the way to the Supreme Court in an effort to expose the impracticality of corporate personhood.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Corporations are imaginary entities, and we've let them run wild,&quot; says Frieman. &quot;Their original intent 200 years ago at the dawn of our nation was to serve human beings. So I'm wresting back that power by making their personhood serve me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The concept of corporate personhood has been an ongoing controversy for yearsbut it hit the mainstream in 2010 following the Supreme Courts Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision, which held that restricting political expenditures by corporations was a violation of their First Amendment rights to free speech. Implicit in such a ruling, some argue, is that the Constitution grants protections to corporations as if they were people.<br />
<br />
Representing Frieman is attorney Ford Greenehe, too, says the state vehicle code treats a person and a corporation as equivalent. <br />
<br />
&quot;When a corporation is present in one's car, it is sufficient to qualify as a two-person occupancy for commuter lane purposes,&quot; says Greene, whos also a San Anselmo city councilmember. &quot;When the corporate presence in our electoral process is financially dominant, by parity it appears appropriate to recognize such presence in an automobile.&quot;   <br />
<br />
Also unclear: If Frieman's ticket is dismissed on the grounds that he and the corporation constitute a carpool--could the San Rafael activist then be fined for driving with an un-seat-belted passenger?<br />
<br />
Friemans court appearance takes place Monday at 3pm at the Marin Superior Court, 3501 Civic Center Drive in San Rafael.

</div>I get the feeling he will lose the case.   But I will laugh if he wins just because it will show how silly things can get after that SCOTUS ruling.</div>

I figured they're be a few people interested so I'm posting it just in case. A friend of mine from high school is married to Norm Rapmund. If you are in to comic books you may recognize the name (lots of Marvel and DC art). In any case, he's decided to let his wife sell off a bunch of his original art work. He's got an extensive collection he's kept over the years. If you are interested in any pieces, just let me know and I can get you in touch with them.<br />
<br />
Here's a list of his work - <a href="http://www.comicbookdb.com/creator_chron.php?ID=988" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.comicbookdb.com/creator_chron.php?ID=988</a><br />

They haven't finished putting together a list of everything he has so you just have to ask if they have anything you are interested in for now.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>AFC<br />
Houston at New England (early Line NE favored by 9)<br />
Ravens at Denver (early line has Denver favored by 9)<br />
<br />
NFC<br />
Green Bay at SanFrancisco (early line has SanFran favored by 3)<br />
Seattle at Atlanta (early line has Atlanta favored by 2.5)<br />
<br />
My picks<br />
<br />
<b>NE over Houston</b>: 2 weeks to prepare and get healthy was a HUGE advantage to NE that was given to them by Houston.  I was not entirely impressed by the victory over the Bengals.  I like NE despite the 9 being a big line.  I just think NE matches up well against Houston.<br />
<br />
<b>Denver beats the Ravens but does not cover</b>.  I liked what the Ravens did to the Colts.  The D was definitely aggressive.  It's one thing to be aggressive with a rookie QB and quite another to be aggressive to a guy that suckers you and can see what is coming nine miles away.  I think the Ravens will cause a couple of turnovers but it will not be enough.  Flacco will be facing a much better D and I do not think Rice can run as well on Denver.  I don't see a cover here as 9 is just too many points for the Ravens D.  <br />
<b><br />
Green Bay with the points over SanFran</b>: This is the game of the week.  Might just be the real Superbowl.  GreenBay is firing on all cylinders offensively and it's a good matchup for them.  SanFran is probably the best overall team in the playoffs but this is a bad matchup defensively for them.  I think the game is a virtual pickem so I will take the points and Greenbay.  Definatley the best game of the weekend on paper.    <br />
<br />
<b>Atlanta over Seattle</b>:  I hate Seattle but seriously, could they get any luckier drawing Atlanta?  The real question is how much Atlanta was cruising at the end of the year vs. are they really just inconsistent.  Seattle just lost a key defender which will weaken their D line a great deal.  Ryan is a solid QB and the whole Atlanta team is good.... it's just... they seem soft.  Seattle is physical and covers very well downfield.  They also bang defenders well beyond the 5 yards and have gotten away with it.  If the game is called tighter then they are screwed.  This pick, giving 2.5 points, makes me nervous but I ain't never gonna root for Pete, I cheat, I abandon my USC program, Cheerleader, Sleezy win Carrol.  Hate him.</div>

			STORY HIGHLIGHTS<br />
<ul><li style=""> &quot;I donated genetic material and that was it for me,&quot; Marotta says</li><li style=""> Kansas says he should have gone through a doctor</li><li style=""> The case started with an ad on Craig's List </li></ul><br />
<br />
(CNN) -- If you're planning to donate sperm in Kansas, you may want to do it through a doctor.<br />
 <br />
That's one message from the case of William Marotta of Topeka. In 2009, he noticed a Craig's List advertisement from a lesbian couple, also in Topeka, seeking donated sperm.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Intrigued&quot; by the ad, he agreed to donate and says he delivered three cupfuls of his sperm -- gratis -- to the women, one of whom gave birth to a daughter.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I donated genetic material, and that was it for me,&quot; he told CNN affiliate WIBW.<br />
 <br />
Or so he thought. That changed when the parents separated and one of the women stopped working because of illness and applied to the state for help, he said. The state contacted Marotta for child support.<br />
 <br />
Kansas officials were not persuaded by what Marotta says were agreements he signed before making his donations that he would assume no financial responsibility for the child, who is now 3 years old.<br />
 <br />
The Kansas Department for Children and Families said any agreement would not apply because a physician did not perform the insemination, which Marotta said was news to him.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I didn't know that there was no doctor involved,&quot; Marotta said Friday.<br />
 <br />
His lawyer, Ben Swinnen, accused the state, where same-sex marriage is not legal, of being politically motivated in its pursuit of $6,000 from his client.<br />
 <br />
&quot;The cost to the state to bring this case far outweighs any benefit the state would get,&quot; he said.<br />
 <br />
Marotta said he met the child once -- a few months ago -- when he and his wife by chance crossed paths with one of the girl's parents at an area carnival.<br />
 <br />
He said he had no intention of assuming a paternal role if he loses the case. &quot;I'm not her parent,&quot; he said.<br />
 <br />
But under Kansas law, he is her father. Had a physician carried out the insemination, that would not be the case, because Marotta would be able to document that he was a sperm donor and not the lover of the girl's mother, said CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen.<br />
 <br />
&quot;For all they know, they were lovers,&quot; she said. &quot;They need that documentation. He's the dad; he ought to be paying up.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Though a physician would have tested the sperm for sexually transmitted diseases and certain genetic disorders, there are disincentives associated with going through a physician.<br />
 <br />
A single attempt at artificial insemination costs about $3,000, and sometimes several tries are needed. &quot;It's a lot cheaper to get someone to come on over with their donation, and then do it yourself at home,&quot; Cohen said.<br />
 <br />
Meanwhile, Marotta owes legal fees and has taken his story to the news media. &quot;If enough noise gets made about it, at this point, maybe things will change for the better,&quot; he said.<br />
 <br />
Asked whether, knowing what he now knows, he would answer the advertisement again, Marotta said, &quot;Probably not.&quot;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hulu Plus is kind of terrible.  Yeah, it's better than watching the movie or TV show on live TV, but it's not competing against live TV.  It's competing against piracy.  Making commercials required as part of the experience is awful.  It would be okay if Hulu Plus had an option that was more expensive and did not include commercials that would be fine, but that option does not exist.  Instead not only are you forced to watch commercials but the entire episode list for shows are not always there.  Sure, they are short commercials but they completely interrupt the viewing experience.  It is jarring and erases whatever emersion previously existed.</div>
