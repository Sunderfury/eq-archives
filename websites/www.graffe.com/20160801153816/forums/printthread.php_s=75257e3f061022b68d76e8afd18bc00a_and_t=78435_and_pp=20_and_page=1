IMO both Bernadette for the weekend and for the marriage. Bernadette is smaller, so will be easier to hip toss. Bernadette has a fuller figure and is a lot more assertive and confident. Bernadette also has the prettier face but that can go either way, a marginal difference I think. Longer term, after the looks fade, Bernadette has more useful skills and will likely earn more in her lifetime, and she has sufficient guile and social acumen to assassinate people when necessary instead of wilting or giving up.  But, we never see her exercise any, so Bernadette may die of a heart attack without an external stimulus pushing her that way. Which of course Howard, being the weeping willow and sad sack that he is would never do. <br />
<br />
Penny is of course also gorgeous, but, she's less assertive and confident. Penny has a more athletic build which is also great in its own way. In the long term, Penny engages in emotionally manipulative arguments frequently, that is great for the show's comedic plot, but day to day that gets old fast and is childish behavior. Penny will likely earn less over time and is more likely to get fat (fitness tends to be correlated with academic success i.e. someone with a doctorate is less likely to be fat than someone with an undegraduate degree or a masters degree). <br />
<br />
On the plus Penny side from what we see in the show, she probably has fucked different people a lot more, so if we stipulate she does not check out in bed, may be the better experience betwen the two. Also, she has longer legs, which can be fun. And she seems like she probably does pilates so would be more flexible.<br />
<br />
Naturally either one is a good choice, but Bernadette is unreasonably penalized for how frumpy the show dresses her when she is clearly as or more drop dead gorgeous as Penny is. <br />

<br />
Anecdotally, there appears to be a 100% correlation with gender on who is selected. Men have always said Bernadette, where as women have always said Penny and puzzled that that is even up for debate. <br />
<br />
While entirely unrelated to the question, this along with some other things, seems to suggest that women are more susceptible to social signaling than men are i.e. women believe Penny is more attractive because the show presents her that way despite being at best in the same realm as Bernadette. It suggests a difference in how information is processed between the two that is genetic. It also aligns with how women are more affected by media than men are in their various gender targeted magazines i.e. Cosmos and Men's Health. <br />
<br />
Possibly also why women spend more time on their phones than men do, in that believing awareness to signaling is valuable, women seek access to it as frequently as possible in order to maintain competence as to what that signal is. Where as men possible don't rely on signaling as heavily, and so do not value access to whatever the most recent signal is. <br />
<br />
While that may be false, if it were true it would explain why women have continually failed to form a coherent bloc in the US* and instead frequently select against their and their families best interest due to external signaling indicating doing so is the most recent and dominant consensus, something which otherwise is baffling and the most likely alternative outcome is that women are generally incompetent, which I do not find a plausible explanation, but it would explain why that explanation has held such common belief for so long. <br />
<br />
* As I noted elsewhere, Women could assume a de facto dictatorship on all decision making if they had a coherent bloc merely by virtue of numbers and ubiquitous geographical presence (no one could gerry mander away such a bloc). There is no way to circumvent such a bloc short of abolishing women's suffrage or greatly decreasing the number of hetrosexuals in the US** In reality they would also steal numbers from other demographics, so it would be an impossible to destabilize bloc. <br />
<br />
** If you could greatly reduce the number of heterosexuals, you would be able to divide across genders due to them not living in exactly the same location together. They would self-segregate to a degree on their own with some push. But, that is not a feasible plan barring some way to turn people gay, which afaik the CIA has yet to develop.<br />

<br />
My hypothesis that Penny will be better in bed due to fucking more, different persons is based on the comparative effectiveness of task error-learning algorithms in AI. In short, by training i.e. fucking on different kinds of data, i.e. people, Penny is more probable to have greater sexual competence compared to fucking the same person or handful of persons  over a long period of time due to being less likely to fall into a minimally acceptable outcome behavior as a result of more different kinds of experiences. <br />
<br />
A reasonable counter argument is that while Penny may have more different kinds of experiences, absent accuracy in the feedback loop, Penny does not improve as rapidly as Bernadette does, due to Bernadette's greater assertiveness being more probable to solicit an accurate information response. <br />
<br />
A counter counter argument is that as Bernadette is mostly experienced with nerds who themselves will be less experienced, they are less likely to have developed as diverse of a palette as the persons Penny is fucking. So, Bernadette's samples grading scale will be less refined where in anything is great. That is, Bernadette's sample is biased towards the higher end of the scale both out of ignorance on the sample data and due to gratitude by the sample data.<br />
<br />
A counter, counter, counter argument is that while that may be true, Bernadette being more situationally acute will perform better analysis on the information feedback and adapt more rapidly and Penny, likely inebriated at the time, will be less likely to recall what information did exist from that experience, so simply cannot do any analysis on it and won't respond in any way with respect to learning on those specific data samples. As this likely describes a lot of Penny's data samples this tilts rapidity in improvement towards Bernadette despite the less diverse data set. <br />
<br />
All of these are reasonable assertions to make. <br />

Not everything that bounces around in the abyss and stumbles out has pragmatic uses, this is one of those things, just let it happen. Even the Tower of Babel needed an adequate sewage system. Sometimes you get TV Dinners, sometimes you get Kobe Beef, killed on site, and prepared straight away. I suppose you are in Japan for this metaphor. This, along with my seemingly awesome but not actually idea of sex toy based exercise to cure obesity*, is in the former category.<br />

I think the biggest challenge is one of maintenance. There is no good model for maintenance on any sex toy that would target a male audience. You are either dealing with cum or anus residue or asking the audience to enema beforehand. And you still are tasked with cleaning any lubricant utilized. So, those are all significant problems.<br />
<br />
In the female audience that is less so the case but still not ideal. Being able to rely on glass or steel toys makes maintenance easier. But, you cannot really make a glass or steel orifice and expect good outcomes.<br />
<br />
I think more than anything I just wanted to be able to use Sexercise in a pitch, such a good portmanteau wasted on a failed design. It's precision napalm all over again. Sigh, there was a dream that was Rome.<br />
<br />
The tagline was <b>Sexercise: Fuck Your Way to a Better Future</b> or <b>Sexercise: Go Fuck Yourself</b> or <b>Sexercise: Fuck Your Way to a Better You</b> or <b>Sexercise: Cum for Your Baby's Future</b>. The idea behind the last one being that dead people cannot raise their children, targeted at the morbidly obese who recently expanded their family naturally. <br />
<br />
To the patriotic demographic <b>Uncle Sam Needs Cum: Fuck Yourself for America</b>.<br />
Then boxes of dildos etc. are dropped on lawns. Feral children claw at them while affluent, kiloton adults stare baffled. Fighting off the packs of rabid children, a lone warrior, Max, opens the box, and what does he see inside? A path to a better self. Flash forward 6 weeks, happiness indices have sky rocketed, pounds are shedding left and right. Once shut-in parental guardians are able to fit through their house doors again. The mothers recognize their own children in the pack, fighting them off with their newly gained fitness, the mothers snag and hold to their breast their fang toothed children. The fangs recede, the children slowly become more human. The world transitions into greater vibrancy. As the mother walks back the sheep wool backed mammoths they once were look like model citizenry by the time the door is reached. Head turning over shoulder, the mother smirks  while both mother and children give a thumbs up to the camera. Fade to black without mentioning the product once. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Internet loses its mind at the insanity of the commerical, Reddit sleuths uncover relevat product information. Sales hit a fever pitch. China shuts down producing iPhones to meet production quoats. The first world no longer are gelatinous fucks. Naturally I am then made dictator for life and enact my other strategies. Some work, some don't. I do better than not. A year in I am assassinated by Grimace: death by blunt objects, some of my own sex toy product lines.<br />

<br />
I married the bernadette. I like Bernadettes. Pennys might be hot and fun (to a certain degree), but they are ultimately dissatisfying and like the wholesomeness I desired. The Amys lack the passion that needs to be in a strong relationship. My wife works with me, we compromise after bitch sessions, and after it is over, we say, &quot;well, that was worth it. We good?&quot; <br />

Bernadette is also the more sexually attractive on the show. She has got an amazing body, and while I love girls in glasses, when she is on talk shows and not wearing the glasses, she is a ridiculous hottie. <br />

</div>This greatly affected the mental construct I made of you over the past year or so of reading your posts. Went from over 40 caucasianish male with latina fetishization, handyman with a decreasingly musical present, most likely married to a latina whose parents are heavily Catholic while she is less so to ????.<br />
<br />
Also a curious preference on female attire. Now that the clothing comes to mind, why the fuck is Bernadette wearing sweaters all the time outside the lab? Isn't California supposed to be warm? It would have been smart for the show to exploit the women in STEM chutzpah by not dressing Bernadette and Amy down. [1]<br />
<br />
What is more weird is that they only dress Amy and Bernadette that way. Non-recurring role women scientists they show in less frumpy clothing. Pretty strange. Also, Bernadette and Amy's attire is fairly non-variant while Penny's changes pretty frequently. The nerd men of course have to demonstrate how nerdy they are by wearing the latest ThinkGeek/J!NX fashion line apropos for whatever topical event is possible to exploit for that sweet, sweet product placement. I would not have been able to guess it by what their interests were, so thinks for the recurring tip off that these are le nerds CBS so that my social accuity isn't utilized.<br />
<br />
Amy's been dead to me since Mayim Bialik (the actor playing Amy) stated she is with the anti-vax crowd, which I would typically ascribe to ignorance but she should know better, so it's disappointing.<br />
<br />
[1] Grace Hopper &gt;&gt; Ada Lovelace. Fite me. Fact, Ada Lovelace's supposed accomplishments are given excess credibility virtue Lovelace's social position. Fact, Grace Hopper is exceedingly well validated and verified. Fact, Grace Hopper has a list of foundational accomplishments and achievements so deep and wide that the Mississippi River is one of its tributaries. Fact, Grace Hopper's resume stacked against any other person in Computer Science figure holds up well and is in the conversation with anyone who could be compared against Hopper. Grace Hopper is the hero a more well founded discourse deserves over Lovelace's less impressive and impossible to validate mythos. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica. QED bitches.<br />

		<blockquote class="restore">In regards to Howard:<br />
<br />
Of the 6 recurring males (4 major), we have Leonard, Howard, Raj, Sheldon, Stuart and Kripke. <br />
<br />
Of those 6, Leonard is way too whiny and afraid of the world to identify with as myself. <br />
<br />
Raj, while a compassionate individual, has a history of being afraid of women (in general), and after losing that fear is far too effeminate, and his humour (while character based) is self-depricating by accident, my own brand of self-depricating humour is forced. <br />
<br />
Sheldon is an ass. He is hilarious to watch, but when you <i>know</i> someone who is Sheldon, they are an annoying person to be around. There are aspects of myself, being a strongly opinionated person on particular topics, especially moral ones, I am not nearly as socially oblivious as Sheldon. <br />
<br />
Stuart is Sheldon without an ego, confidence, or any redeeming qualities whatsoever. It makes me wonder how his character could even afford to <i>run</i> a comic book store. This is a sitcom, and reality should be considered far and wide apart from it. <br />
<br />
Kripke is generally a good character to compare to. I have a tic that is as socially debilitating as his character's lisp, but I've learned to work around it (I suffer from a mild form of Tourette Syndome) in order to avoid most cases of social awkwardness. He is also too on the nose with his vendettas and rivalry, and way too flamboyant in his social directions and assertiveness. <br />
<br />
Howard, on the other hand, is mostly a goofball. He is intelligent, and completely aware of his surroundings, and problems, and openly accepts them. He does not deny them, but instead says, &quot;So what? They're not problems, they're elements of <i>character</i>.&quot; Growing up, and even still, my mother has always been way too over bearing. She is, has been and always will be a yeller. I often feel as though I grew up Jewish, if not for all the Bar Mitzvahs that I attended, that my mother is a very jewish, opinionated mother (but she is protestant). I do not react to my mother in the same way Howard reacts(ed) to his mother, but I realize that she is a major part of my life, and how I speak to her (I try to call her or e-mail her at least once a week, but often do so more) is much more conversational and empathic than Howard's character deal(t) with his mother. <br />
<br />
The way I work with my wife is very much like Howard and Bernadette. My wife is a bit quippy and dry in her sarcasm. I am usually the goofy one, but when she goes there she drives me nuts, as she is so dry I <i>know</i> she is joking, but she is <i>so</i> dry, she'll run with it to a point I have to leave the room because I'm afraid she is actually being serious. <br />
<br />
For example, one day, we were watching a History Channel show, and my wife, who doesn't care as much for History Channel as she does Bravo, or A&amp;E True Crime/Hoarders, decided to say something to the effect of, &quot;Why don't they do a show on Forrest Gump?&quot; And she <i>went there</i>. Committed. This is the woman that I deal with when she doesn't get her way on the television show, and knows something to tell me that will make me get up and go, because I <i>know</i> she is joking, but she says it in such a way that is just going to knock me over senseless. <br />
<br />
That being said, Howard is the easiest individual on the show to identify with, for me. Everyone else is a pussy. <br />
<br />
Wil Wheaton doesn't count, by the way, because his on screen persona is nearly identical to his real world self, and he is clearly the show's only alpha male, if ever there is one. <br />
<br />
If that was the case, I might identify slightly more with aspects of Wil Wheaton, but he's a bit too flashy and arrogant to truly identify with.</blockquote>

That was some good analysis IMO. I had not realized that about Stuart's character. I think that is spot on though. <br />
<br />
I  don't agree about the past 2 seasons of Raj or since he got a gf  anyways being effeminate though. Raj has interests and skills that are  associated with women more often than not, but he does them anyways  because he does not consider anything other than what he enjoys in that  regard. And why should he? Growing up in India his parents were/are rich  so any social scorn for atypical characteristics Raj has would not  impact him in any meaningful way. Then arriving stateside Raj just kept  up with that pattern doing what he wants. The gender label isn't something Raj considers when deciding what to do in other words. So, for him the notion of effeminate is a value other ascribe to his actions but not a value he applies to his actions. To Raj they are Raj's actions. The idea that they are effeminate or masculine is nonsensical or deferred from being considered from Raj's POV. <br />
<br />
Howard in the show is  not really aware of his problems in social situations as much as is  claimed in the analysis though. He had horrid luck with women forever  and was lecherous early on, Bernadette and Howard almost broke up after  Raj drunkenly spilled facts about Howard's past that were less than well  socially accepted. Howard never realized his mother was a source of  friction for him and Bernadette while simultaneously possessing the  wherewithal to act upon it, he let it fester until Bernadette I think  lashed at him over it.<br />
<br />
But with Howard's mom being dead now, we  have not seen Howard in any character developing moments as far as  situations like that go. He's becoming the least developed character on  the show next to Bernadette and Amy and whoever Raj's gf is named. Molly  Ringwold or whatever who pops in on Groundhog's day. <br />
<br />
Anyways, that's pretty good stuff.<br />
<br />
If I had to push myself into a Big Bang Theory Character Sized Tube I would probably be a mixture of post-gf Raj and Kripke, which I had not realized until reading your description of Kripke. If I had to select one it is either Kripke or post-gf Raj. <br />
<br />
I am not sure why you think Kripke is a pussy. Been a while from earlier seasons but he is always hustling Sheldon or Leonard in a scene from what I recall and is rather morally ambivalent having no problems cashing checks on a field he believes is unsolvable. We have scene Kripke be physically weak if that is what you meant. I think Sheldon and Kripke had a rather poor show of wrestling or something at some point.</blockquote>

In my defense, i have not paid much attention to the series since 2013, or 2014 - whatever season raj dated and kept getting stood up by the short haired brunette from garfunkel &amp; oates, so my character analyzes are mostly older.</blockquote>

</div>Well, you have missed all the best episodes since since season 1 or so. I am getting real tired of Amy's character though.</blockquote>

</div>You missed a few of the finer details in that post. <br />
<br />
I'm not actually Jewish. I feel like I <i>grew</i> up Jewish. It is part of the reason I identify with the character. I did have many friends whose Bar Mitzvah's that I attended, and while my mother grew up Protestant, she also has had many, many, many female friends in her life as my mother who were Jewish, and carried on as though she was herself. (Not faking it, just respecting certain traditions). <br />
<br />
My wife is not Catholic. She grew up JW, but doesn't practice so much, and neither do her parents, so much, either. Her grandparents are both elders and were once catholic, but that is where that ends. <br />
<br />
There are actually very many Jewish Mexicans. It is probably the third most common religion in Mexico, especially among those with Pueblan ancestry. Part of the untold mysticism/legend of the defense of Puebla (Cinco De Mayo celebration) was because so many of the people there were previously fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. <br />
<br />
There are also very, very many Jewish &quot;Makers.&quot; The general prominence of Judaism within society is similar to that of the Chinese. A funny thing in Eastern logic is calling the Chinese, the &quot;jews of asia.&quot; The idea is that they are both type cast about setting themselves into any particular facet of society, finding a field that is in need of service, and putting themselves in as the sole offerer of those goods/services. In the case of Jews in Mexico, there are many individuals who fled Europe and the Middle East during the 16th and 17th centuries who were all sorts of simple craftsmen.<br />
<br />
She is not a second Gen immigrant, btw. Depending on how you want to define California, she would be considered of Califas if you wanted to go that far back. Because she is mixed and doesn't identify with the Chicano style of heritage, and just as a California girl with mexican roots, she identifies simply as White, or Mexican, or both, depending on the context in which it comes up.</blockquote>

</div>My understanding of Judaism is that if your mother is a Jew then you are  a Jew as well because it descends matrilineally regardless of belief in  Judaism on the mothers part at least with Orthodox Judaism. That is  from the POV of Orthodox Jews, being a Jew if your mother is a Jew is  irrevocable in the same way that most Protestant denominations hold that  salvation is irrevocable. Other forms of Judaism disagree on that point  though.<br />
<br />
I did not mean to imply I was claiming my guesses as  being fact, I was explaining why I made those guesses in case it came  off as an assertion. It was not intended to cause offense, it is just  the mental construct I had made based on your posts and some common  traits associated with them were extrapolated. <br />
<br />
The reality is  very diverse though and much more unlikely. From my POV labels are  rarely informative about a person who claims to be some label in that  knowledge that they claim to hold some attribute such as being  Republican or what have you, does not inform me any about the quality of  that individual or how true their claim is even if they are not being  intentionally deceptive, people rarely have an accurate picture of  themselves so are unable to tell you what they are or are not in  anything practical. An example here being someone who claims an  association with a party while not acting from any of the parties  principles in reality. The Christmas-Easter Protestant is an example of  that behavior.<br />
<br />
So, I have never found typical reasons for  division amongst people compelling for that reason. Regardless of what  someone tells me about themselves it does not tell me how likely they  are to try and sabotage myself at some point in the future or how likely  they are to sabotage themselves i.e. be an erratic, volatile person.  The effect is that regardless of how cretinous the populace feels about a  demographic, there are always some people within it that are  worthwhile, so adhering to divisiveness for its own sake only results in  denying ourselves better outcomes compared to determing what an  individual actually is through experiencing that person. No one has ever  been able to sufficiently demonstrate value in the first approach to  me. <br />
<br />
Anyways, all of what you said is cool. I feel the same way as your wife about intrinsic characteristics that people pattern match on during a first impression. It is one of the things I enjoy about the Internet is that people can be judged based on the quality of their person rather than affiliations with groups whose determined value lacks any actual integrity in the calculation.<br />
<br />
If it cannot be audited, formalized, or reproduced such claims are useless shit and its proponents can fuck off and get out the way while we fix root causes in a manner that generalizes over the whole rather than some selected intrinsic attribute.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it is amusing and informative to mess with people's perceptions based on how their biases will likely cause them to react. Oklahomans continually prove fertile ground here as they embody so perfectly South Park's bar scenes wherein whoever comes in is told,&quot;We don't take kindly to your types here.&quot; They have shockingly brittle perceptions.</blockquote>
