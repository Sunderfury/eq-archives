			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So we have an old beige goldenrod colored front-load whirlpool.<br />
<br />
The way it comes apart in order to pull the spinning portion out is taking the two screws out of the right side lint screen on the top right, to the right of all dials. it goes down through the body of the drier itself to the vent), then popping the clips on the various lids. (top first, to lift it all up so you can see the (drum? tumbler?) then you pull the front lid off. Don't remember if I did that before or after the bottom portion that was about 3 inches high and the width of the door/lid at the very bottom by the feet.<br />
<br />
The vent is right side down below the 2-foot-long lint screen at the very bottom. NO unusual kinks in the aluminium pipe outgoing, but it's been taped down VERY securely and is fitting into a small space.<br />
<br />
I can grab a model number tomorrow night, I'm working from memory here.<br />
<br />
The vent is about 15 feet from the exit vent (exterior) to first bend (interior).<br />
<br />
First bend from the 15 foot ingress of pipe runs a 5 foot bend down towards the ground and a standard curved coupler into the drier itself (see link at bottom for kind)<br />
<br />
This is taped all to hell and I don't want to remove it because I don't have time or inclination for more pipe tape (tis the season), and being that I don't have any in stock I'm loathe to move ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
Due to the cramped nature of where the water heater and the fact that we had to pull the washer and drier out to work on the drier two times ago and the drier out to work on the washer, it's a LOT of disconnecting that I didn't connect.<br />
<br />
<b>Is there a way to push the drier fuzz UP the chain TOWARDS the external exhaust from inside the drier with something like a coathanger without taking out the freshly re-applied tub?</b><br />
<br />
Would doing it from the outside help the drier blow the rest of the fuzz out?<br />
<br />
I have some chained together coat hangers...<br />
<br />
The last time we did this was when my father-in-law taped it on so tightly right after his stroke and he went a bit overboard. I can smell more drier smell in the house now (years later) to the point that it's coming up the heater vents (central air is located in the same room as the washer/drier assembly) and it's been taking longer and longer for things to dry.<br />
<br />
Might have been why the glued belt around the drier tub dried out and pulled loose a few months back.<br />
<br />
I've even considered using one of the never-used toilet augurs we got on the aluminum tubes from the outside, but there MUST be an easier way.<br />
<br />
Electric drier, not gas.<br />
<br />
Edit - corner part going into the bottom of the driver below the lint filter is this, rest of the pipe is same gauge and quality, no TRULY flexible stuff.<br />

			Holiday lights are meant to add some cheer to your day, but a British regulator has pointed out that they may have an unwanted side effect: interference with your WiFi network.<br />
<br />
On Tuesday, Ofcom -- an agency similar to the Federal Communications Commission -- named holiday lights as one of many electronic devices that can trip up your Internet connection. The agency has released a new app to check for interference that, alas, is only available in Britain.<br />
<br />
How do lights affect a WiFi network? Apparently the wiring in the lights can add to the radio frequency interference in your home, which in turn could confound the signals from your router. Lights aren't the only culprit, however — the same is true of many other devices. Microwaves, older Bluetooth devices, baby monitors and cordless phones all get a mention in a Cisco white paper from 2007 outlining common reasons for WiFi interference. Many Internet providers see complaints spike around the holidays, since networks can get congested when you're all gathered for a family meal — but lights may be a contributing factor. The Irish Times reported a similar problem last year, saying that blinking lights are particularly bad for interference.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean there's any need to be less festive than you normally are. A string of lights won't crash your network. All Ofcom is letting us know is that having more things, such as lights, plugged into your outlets could contribute to some WiFi slowdown, and more ostentatious displays could certainly add to interference that's already in your home.<br />
<br />
If you're really curious about how your lights are affecting your network, you could conduct your own home science experiment and see how your network performs with your lights on or off. Another option is to move them as far away from your router as is practical. That way you can still watch &quot;White Christmas&quot; on Netflix in seasonally appropriate lighting.<br />
<br />
That may help solve whatever immediate, decor-related WiFi issues you may have. But you can follow similar tips to keep your network running smoothly throughout the whole year, as well.  Moving electronics away from your router is also a good idea, if you find that you're dropping your connection or losing speed.<br />
<br />
Also, if you don't have a password on your home network, you may want to consider creating one for security and speed. Your neighbors may be hanging out on your network without your knowledge. Adding a password nips that behavior in the bud.<br />
<br />
Another option is to change the channel on your router. As with a radio, your router can broadcast over multiple channels, and switching this can help you avoid interference. That's particularly useful if your problem is other people's WiFi networks, as is often the case in apartments or other close-quarter living situations. Since most people stick with the defaults, chances are most people around you on are the same channel. You can change this by heading to your router's settings from any machine connected to the network, which you can find by typing your router's IP address into the part of your browser where you normally type in Web addresses.<br />
<br />
Most routers have similar addresses -- some variation on 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1 -- but you can find out for sure by doing a little digging on your PC or Mac.
