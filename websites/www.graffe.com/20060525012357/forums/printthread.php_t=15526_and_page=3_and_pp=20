hehe I can't answer for Whiz, but imho there were a few pains in the ass in the Alpha, and in the last couple of pushes you saw a lot more jerks stealing ore nodes or herb nodes or killstealing, etc.  Well, you saw it sometimes, and read about it more on the boards.  But, there were lots of great people, too.  :)</div>

Well, 100 percent soloing can get you through most quests, but it almost certainly will not get you through elite quests until you're of a much, much higher level, if ever. (I know -- I've tried.) If you're at all interested in doing quests when the XP and loot is still reasonable for your level, in many cases (although by no means all), you'll want to at least duo or trio.</div>

		<div>I honestly found a lot of the MMORPG veterans to be a lot more tiresome than the B.net folks. Other than the Diablo II vets not necessarily "getting" the concept of killstealing or jumping on a herb or ore node while you were clearing to it (which didn't happen terribly often -- most folks figured out how annoying that was and became pretty courteous about it by the final parts of alpha), I had zero issues with the B.net crew.<br />

I found the people proclaiming how kickass they were in UO/EQ/DAoC/Shadowbane and thus you should salute when they walked by to be a lot more irritating (and unintentionally amusing).</div>

		<div>Wonderfull post. This made me once again interested in WoW but i have one, serious doubt about WoW:<br />
<br />
You have spent few months looks to me you already know whole the WoW world, nearly all tradeskills, races and so on. I afraid that WoW may be too easy compared to learning "how to play well at EQ" for example. And I am the kind of guy who loves MMORGP and other big games mainly cause they are complicated, huge and push you to dig info on web, learn stuff, find out everything in general. Diablo was neat playability but there was not much to learn for example after spending there few months. EQ chained me for more months of learning background of classes and races and such.<br />
<br />
So what i expect from WoW or EQ2 is some level of deep knowledge to aquire to play well. Will i find soemthing like or this will be jsut an easy game for kids for few months and then just "farming stuff" before you decide to switch to other game?</div>

Oh, by the way, they reworked some of the horde women during alpha. They are by no means anywhere near done, but the current model of the female troll was a huge improvement over the hunched one they previously had. <br />

How hard would 2-boxing be?  And what about 3, or 4 boxing?  (Harder, easier, or about the same as in EQ?)<br />

To what extent can you powerlevel in WoW?  (i.e. twinking, buffing, etc.)  I'm probably one of the few people that consider the ability to power-level a good thing.<br />

		<div>OK questions:<br />
<br />
Gnomes are how big?<br />
<br />
Talk to me about guilds!!  How hard are they to form/get tabards for!?<br />
<br />
Is there any sense of "camping"  By that I mean just sort of repeatedly doing the same thing ad naseum?<br />
<br />
Have they begun to disclose anything about PvP?<br />
<br />
Have they disclosed anything about endgame content?<br />
<br />
Whiz!  No comments about the lore?  How much is there?  Are there books you can read? Or NPCs that just talk to you about background stuff?<br />
<br />
Do they do cut scenes like in FFXI?  <br />
<br />
Dungeons?  What about Dungeons!?  Have you tried em?  Are they like instanced adventures?  Is there loot in em?  <br />
<br />
Speaking of Loot... how does loot work?  Randomized like in Diablo? Certain monsters drop certain loot?  Nameds drop better loot?  You probably only care if you are on a quest since that is the best loot?  <br />
<br />
How is the economy?  How is the player ecomonomy supported?  Auction channel?  Are there any player vendors?  <br />
<br />
GAH!  HEAD EXPLODING!<br />
<br />
edit: OK bandaged exploded head.  <br />
<br />
Here is a big one:  I just reread this thread.  The game really does not seem to be very close to done.  Correct me if I am wrong please but, um... in no place are levels 31-60 made.  No quests for them - no skill balancing - no items.  No end game at all.  BAH!  Fricking game is not close at all.... gonna be at least another six months!!!</div>

		<div>They didn't say 31+ isn't made, they said its not done yet.<br />
<br />
They also don't have Hunters and Druids in the game yet, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.<br />
<br />
edit: decided to add more:<br />
<br />
Whiz said some people did 1-30 in a weekend.  This keeps those people starting over and over and over again as other classes, stress testing the lowbie area's  (imagine if everyone NOW playing EQ suddenly logged into the newbie areas).  Also, since first impressions are the most important, its a good idea to have the beginning levels the most polished you have.  <br />
<br />
I'm still crying because I didn't get into Beta =(  <br />
<br />
I expect WoW to have the biggest MMORPG gaming launch ever.   I'm, such a dork I would pay to just watch someone play =(  Luckily, a guy I work with has a friend who's supposed to have made it into Beta on the Fansite promotion thing.</div>
