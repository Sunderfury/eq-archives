The Abyss Chronicles (Patch 2) Test Center Notes [Preliminary]<br />
June 9th, 2008<br />
<br />
The Abyss Chronicles (Patch 2) is heading to Test Center today!<br />
<br />
This is the largest addition to Hellgate: London to date. There is a new town with a new quest line that includes four new boss fights, the Consignment House, the Blademaster rebalance, Mythic and Double-Edged items, rings that go into the new trinket slot, new armor sets for each faction, new weapons and uniques for each faction and on and on Ill let these Patch Notes get into the specifics, but we have a lot of improvements in this patch for subscribers and non-subscribers alike.<br />
<br />
Weve been fixing bugs and polishing this new content for a couple weeks now, and we plan on focusing on polishing it for a while longer. You will see by the list of caveats in this post that we arent finished yet. In fact, at the time of this writing we have made 140 changes since this specific build was completed  we are still fixing things as fast as we can, but we tried to get you the first build that was ready for Test Center. This post contains the current Patch Notes for The Abyss Chronicles, but I can guarantee you that things will keep changing over the next few weeks. During that time, as we see you guys playing in Test Center and hear your feedback, the new content will probably be nerfed, buffed, and radically changed. Please just roll with the punches.<br />
<br />
We need your help to polish this Chronicle while it is still in Test Center. Players who are in Test Center enjoy several cool perks: double experience gain, a free Skill Retrainer each login, a free Attribute Retrainer each login, a free Expertise Retrainer each login, a Test Center-only vendor who sells the skill scrolls (he didnt end up in this build), and a nice small community of fun people to play with. So, hop on Test Center and post the issues that you have found here in the forums.<br />
<br />
Tyler (Bogustus)<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
GENERAL<br />
<br />
    * All characters made prior to the launch of The Abyss Chronicles (Patch 2) will receive a Skill Retrainer, Attribute Retrainer, and Expertise Retrainer upon logging in. Attribute Retrainers also unlearn an Engineer's drone's attributes. Players must make inventory space for the three 1x1-sized (single cell) items to receive them. The items will be given to the character when there is sufficient inventory space. Players in Test Center will get all three items with each log-on.<br />
    * Erich the Attribute Retrainer now stands in Holborn Station. All players may pay him to redistribute their stat points. The cost for redistributing points goes up with level with big jumps at level 16 and 31.<br />
<br />
<br />
NEW FEATURES<br />
<br />
    * New Abyss Quest Line with Four New Boss Fights:<br />
          o Travel to the all new Parliament Square and help Titus of the Cabal fend off the rapid spread of the Abyss, a new Demonic underground that grows in size as Demonkind consumes more of our world. The only way to halt the Abyss is to seek out and destroy those who control it. Lure the four Abyss Lords from their cursed realm by collapsing their Hellrifts (a new Rift for each of the boss types), then confront the masters as they emerge to investigate the problem. Four repeatable boss runs with four new bosses! Features three new environments and some reworked environments.<br />
    * New Shared Stash System:<br />
          o The Shared Stash will now feature separate panes for each gameplay mode: Normal, Elite, Hardcore, and Hardcore Elite. Items currently in your Shared Stash will be placed in the correct pane.<br />
    * Major Rebalance of the Blademaster Class:<br />
          o The Blademaster class has been significantly rebalanced with changes to almost every skill. Overall, they should do more damage and have many more options than before. Some of the highlights include Strength now stacking on top of the skill percent bonuses  a huge boost  and Blademasters can now gain a Surge with any melee attack or with any melee skill (rather than just when killing something with a Surge skill).<br />
    * Improved, Configurable Guild Controls:<br />
          o Guilds will now have five titles they can assign to members. The titles can be renamed. There can only be one Guild Leader. Non-subscribers can only have the lowest two titles. The Guild Leader can configure what the middle three titles are allowed to do including invite new members, promote and demote existing members, kick members, and send all-guild e-mail. The lowest title is not allowed to invite, promote, demote, kick, or send guild e-mails.<br />
                + Guild Leader (Only one character is the Guild Leader. They can do anything including change the rules for the guild and rename the guild ranks.)<br />
                + Officer (Subscriber-only. The Guild Leader can allow them to Invite, Promote, Demote, Kick, or Guild E-mail.)<br />
                + Member (Subscriber-only. The Guild Leader can allow them to Invite, Promote, Demote, Kick, or Guild E-mail.)<br />
                + Agent (Any player. The Guild Leader can allow them to Invite.)<br />
                + Recruit (Any player. This rank can't have any privileges.)<br />
    * Consignment House:<br />
          o Players can place items into the Consignment House to offer them for sale at a set price. All players in the same gameplay mode can see and purchase that item. The Consignment House currently only offers a buy out price, there is no bidding.<br />
          o The Consignment House is accessed in Stonehenge and Templar Base.<br />
          o The default duration for listed items is seven days.<br />
          o Listed items are mailed back upon expiration, as is payment for successful listings.<br />
          o Listed items can be withdrawn.<br />
          o While players cannot place items up for auction (bidding) yet, this feature is planned for the future.<br />
          o The Consignment House can be searched using type, quality, and item level filters.<br />
          o Search queries can be sorted by price.<br />
          o All uniques in Hellgate: London can be viewed using the Consignment House.<br />
    * Three New Skills for all Classes:<br />
          o Skill Scrolls are new items which unlock the new skills and allow skill points to be put into them. For example, the Spider Mine Schematic unlocks the Spider Mine skill for Engineers. The Skill Scrolls will be tradable and can be used by all players; however, they drop off of boss monsters in the subscriber-only Abyss levels. Only a few of the skills will be enabled in the first Patch 2 build that goes to Test Center.<br />
    * Trinket Inventory Slots:<br />
          o There will be two new Trinket inventory slots. The first trinkets will drop as cursed rings which can be cleaned up through the Transmogrifier. These cursed rings will mostly drop in the Abyss levels, but they can be found elsewhere too. These items are tradable and can be used by all players.<br />
    * Attribute Respec Vendor:<br />
          o Bob, the Attribute Respec Vendor, will allow you to spend palladium to remove points one at a time from an Attribute and add them to your unassigned Attribute Points pool. The cost to remove each point goes up with character level.<br />
    * Stack Splitting:<br />
          o You will be able to right-click on a stack of items and select to split it into smaller stacks using a new radial menu option. A dialog will pop up and let you type in how many items to place in the new stack.<br />

SKILL ORGANIZATION<br />
Weve reorganized each classs skill page into 3 named tabs! Since these new skill tabs are more compact, the skills page now fits within the middle panel area of the UI. The reorganization of the skills into separate tabs is both much more intuitive and visually pleasing. To stay consistent with the new arrangement, some skills now belong to different skill groups. The new skill tabs are named:<br />
<br />
Summoner<br />
<br />
    * Elementals, Demons, Necromancy<br />
<br />
Evoker<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
GAME BALANCE<br />
With The Abyss Chronicle (Patch 2), we are taking the opportunity to change a number of global balance issues based off of player feedback and trends that we've noticed through the Evil Eye.<br />
<br />
Shields<br />
<br />
    * The Shield Recharge Delay (time after getting hit and before Shields begin to recharge) has been reduced to 2.5 seconds from 4 seconds.<br />
    * The base Shield Recharge rate has been doubled to 10% per second, from 5%. This is a static value, remaining constant regardless of level or amount of shields.<br />
    * The Shields curve (amount provided by items and skills) has been improved dramatically. This change has been retroactively applied to old items.<br />
    * Templar Armor lines have been given a substantial boost in Shields, retroactively<br />
    * Related Properties:<br />
          o Base (inherent) Shield Overload properties have been removed from all Swords. These are the inherent Shield Overload amounts that were previously on all Swords. This change is retroactive.<br />
<br />
Armor &amp; Health<br />
<br />
    * The Armor curve has been rescaled to use much larger values to allow for greater accuracy when applying percent bonuses. 5400 Armor is now required to achieve 50% absorption against level 50 opponents. All old armor pieces have been retroactively updated.<br />
    * Relative Armor values provided by Cabalist and Hunter armor lines have been increased, such that they provide higher absorption than previously. This change is retroactive.<br />
    * Relative Armor values provided by Blademaster armor lines have been slightly decreased, such that they provide slightly less absorption than previously. This change is retroactive.<br />
    * Relative Armor values provided by Guardian armor lines have been substantially decreased, such that they provide much less absorption than previously. This change is retroactive.<br />
    * Relative Armor values provided by Shield items (Templar) have been substantially decreased, such that they provide much less absorption than previously. This change is retroactive.<br />
    * Related Properties:<br />
          o Standard Armor bonus properties now operate under a new mechanic: they increase the armor of the base item by a percent.<br />
          o The Total Armor Value properties bonuses have been lowered to 3/4/5%. This change is retroactive.<br />
          o Inherent Total Armor Value properties found on some Templar armor lines have been changed to use the standard Armor bonus properties, retroactively.<br />
          o Pet Armor bonus properties bonuses have been scaled down, retroactively.<br />
          o Pet Health bonus properties bonuses have been scaled down, retroactively.<br />
<br />
Feed Requirements<br />
<br />
    * Many armor lines have had their feed requirements changed (all retroactively) to require feeds that make more sense for the classes they were made for (and all armor lines now have Stamina as the primary feed requirement):<br />
          o Summoner armor lines now require Stamina and Willpower feeds instead of Strength and Willpower.<br />
          o Low level general Cabalist armor lines now require Stamina and Willpower feeds instead of Strength and Willpower.<br />
          o Engineer armor lines now require Stamina and Accuracy feeds instead of Strength and Willpower.<br />
          o Low and high level general Hunter armor lines now require Stamina and Accuracy feeds instead of Strength and Stamina.<br />
          o Blademaster armor lines now require Stamina and Strength feeds instead of just Strength.<br />
          o Guardian armor lines now require Stamina (primary) and Strength (secondary) feeds instead of Strength (primary) and Stamina (secondary).<br />
          o Low level general Templar armor now requires Stamina and Strength feeds instead of just Strength.<br />
          o High level general Templar armor now requires Stamina feed instead of Strength.<br />
    * Many Sword varieties have had their feed requirements changed (all retroactively) in order to promote a variety of builds:<br />
          o Quick, primarily single-target Swords with inherent bonuses to critical chance now require Strength and Accuracy feeds.<br />
          o Slower, primarily single-target Swords require Strength feed only.<br />
          o Splash damage Swords now require Strength and Willpower feeds.<br />
    * All mod properties can now be found requiring any one out of the four Feed types, rather than usually just Willpower. This is to allow for better optimization and customization when spending Attribute Points.<br />
<br />
Elemental Effects<br />
<br />
    * Poison effects now prevent the afflicted character or monster from receiving any benefits from health regeneration and abilities that grant health regeneration; however, some abilities which grant health regeneration (such as health injectors) are no longer prevented from being used.<br />
    * The cooldown on Elemental Effects Removal and Defense consumables has been decreased to 15 seconds.<br />
    * The group cooldown on Elemental Effects Removal and Defense consumables has been decreased to 5 seconds.<br />
    * Effects Removal and Defense consumables no longer share a group cooldown with Adrenaline Pills and Shield Boosters.<br />
    * Related Properties:<br />
          o The bonuses provided by standard Elemental Defense properties have been improved, and they now also provide an Elemental Defense to a secondary Elemental Effect.<br />
          o The All Elemental Defenses property has been improved.<br />
<br />
Properties<br />
<br />
    * All available properties are now weighted consistently throughout the game by the general group of properties they belong to. This means that the frequency of any Skill bonus property appearing at any level will remain constant, as will a Damage bonus property, etc.<br />
    * The rarities of the different types of properties have been rebalanced.<br />
    * All Attributes bonus properties have been scaled down, retroactively, to a maximum of 10 to All Attributes. The feed requirements of these properties have also been retroactively scaled down according to their new attribute bonus values.<br />
    * The special properties from the Guy Fawkes event will no longer spawn.<br />
    * A bug which caused skill group damage bonus properties to not apply their bonus correctly has been fixed. These damage bonuses stack (multiply) with regular damage bonuses, and add to damage bonuses provided by skills.<br />
    * A new set of skill group damage bonus properties has been added, which increase the damage of the Guardians Shield skills.<br />
    * The common version of the stun strength bonus property has been renamed, Intense.<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
    * Adrenaline Pills and Shield Boosters now share a 5-second cooldown with Health Injectors and Powerpacks.<br />
    * The maximum stack sizes for consumables, PRDs, analyzers, essences, and boss heads have been increased to 100.<br />
    * The maximum stack size for scraps has been increased to 10000.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
    * Elemental Attack Strengths are now reduced by 75% instead of 25%.<br />
    * Fixed an issue causing players to increasingly do more and more damage than expected to other players at higher levels.<br />
    * Health Injectors may no longer be used.<br />
<br />
Monsters &amp; Quests<br />
<br />
    * The battle with Wurm for the Hooked quest has been rebalanced.<br />
    * The event for the The Wall quest has been rebalanced, and now scales with the players level.<br />
    * The battle with the infected Exospector for the Gundown quest has been rebalanced, and now scales with the players level.<br />
    * Shield Overload abilities on monsters have been significantly toned down. Now, a monster can at most deal 100% extra damage to Shields, compared to 300%.<br />
    * Monsters Shield Recharge Delay (time after getting hit and before Shields begin to recharge) has been reduced to 2.5 seconds from 4 seconds.<br />
    * Monsters base Shield Recharge rate has been doubled to 10% per second, from 5%. This is a static value, remaining constant regardless of level or amount of shields.<br />
<br />
Skills<br />
<br />
    * Every skill can now be trained at each level after the skills base level and skill prerequisites are met. For example, Sword of Reckoning can now be trained up to rank 9 when the character is level 9.<br />
    * The update speed for Auras has increased to once every second, up from once every 3 seconds. This means that Auras will more quickly evaluate how many enemies are within their radius, as well as increase the frequency that Aura of Deflection and Aura of Vengeance will attempt to destroy or reflect projectiles.<br />
    * Many errors and inconsistencies in skill descriptions have been fixed.<br />
<br />
Templar<br />
We have corrected an error in the way that damage bonuses provided by Templar skills were being applied. Previously, most of the damage bonuses were being added directly to the damage bonuses gained from other sources, which meant that the damage increase from using one of these skills was effectively much less than the listed value. Now, the damage bonuses for these skills multiply the total damage of the Templars attack, so the listed damage bonus will always be the exact increase in damage gained from using the skill. One side effect of this fix is that we have had to generally adjust the damage bonuses of Templar skills downwards; however, the actual damage provided by these skills has been increased tremendously.<br />

<br />
KNOWN ISSUES<br />
As this is a preliminary build of The Abyss Chronicles (Patch 2), there are some existing issues which players should be aware of:<br />
<br />
    * NPCs:<br />
          o The Test Center Vendor who will offer Skill Scrolls on Test Center is not implemented in this build (but is in the next build).<br />

          o After all Lieutenants are spawned, Talox will die from killing only one of the Lieutenants.<br />
          o The method for resetting hellrifts is disabled. Players must log off/on to reset hellrifts.<br />
          o If party members go into separate hellrifts they see each others Escape the Hellrift message.<br />
          o Clearing a hellrift in the Abyss quest prevents the player from reentering Parliament Square.<br />

          o Abyss bosses respawn automatically after completing the Abyss quest.<br />
          o Player is spawned on the wrong side of East Treasury and Middlesex Guildhall in Parliament Square.<br />
    * Achievements:<br />

          o Riftwarrior Gunners sometimes spawn without weapons.<br />
          o Monsters do not attack if the player is standing in a cubicle (East Treasury and West Treasury).<br />
          o Fallen Savage Fiends frequently jump off the Abyss level.<br />
          o Fiend Tanks are not balanced (too hard).<br />

          o The current listing duration for all items is seven days.<br />
          o The Consignment House is for all players. However, the Consignment House location in Templar Base is not working in this build.<br />
          o The Consignment House is presently not listing miscellaneous items. Posting consumable items such as Analyzers, Adrenaline Pills, and Health Injectors will yield in them not appearing on the Consignment House.<br />
          o Duplicate item names appear in the search list.<br />
          o Hitting the left or right arrows in the Asking Price pane makes the cursor jump two spaces.

It's cool they're putting in the attribute retrainer, but did I miss them putting in a skill retrainer?  I don't see why they'd put in the former but not the latter.</div>
