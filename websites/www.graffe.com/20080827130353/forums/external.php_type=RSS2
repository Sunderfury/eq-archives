			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I'm more interested in major trends that will affect population levels in a particular area (Multiple thousands over the course of a year), but I'd like as much current data as possible in a real time format over as many areas as possible.<br />
<br />
We occasionally get a few reports (like the Minneapolis area getting 10,000+ Hmong immigrants in the space of a few weeks several years back) but I'd really like something on a larger scale (Country-wide if I'm lucky, worldwide if I'm truly blessed) just as an interesting tool that ranks right up there with the <a href="http://visz.rsoe.hu/alertmap/index.php?lang=" target="_blank">RSOE</a> site, only with articles as well as tracking.<br />
<br />
Wishful thinking, but I'm hoping some information may come across the press wires or something.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This book is a fucking waste of money.  I know Quelian has some additional dislikes, such as the culling of the pantheon, but I can't get past how fucking horrible this is to really notice the new 'flavor' of the realms.<br />
<br />
The entire history of what happened from the last campaign for 100 fucking years is &quot;the spellplague happened&quot;  I've got it in a spoiler below that has the entire text, but that's the basic summary.<br />
<br />
The Pantheon section is fucking horrible in several ways, here is a sample for Umberlee, a Sea Goddess:<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Quote:</div>
	<table cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td class="alt2">
			<hr />
			
				Umberlee<br />
The Bitch Queen<br />
Chaotic Evil Goddess of the Deep Wilds<br />
The Queen of the Deeps is a harsh mistress, largelyuncaring of her mortal worshipers’ pleas for mercy when one of her storms whips the seas of Toril into a killing frenzy. Still, hardly a soul steps aboard a ship who doesn’t whisper at least a cursory appeal to her in the hope that her random mercies fall their way.<br />
Her waveservants rely on the scattered alms of terrified sailors for a minimal living, preaching the majesty of the uncaring ocean and the inherent hopelessness of anyone who dares set to sea.
			
			<hr />
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Uh, what is she the goddess of? Bitches? Who is her Pimp/Rapper?<br />
<br />
But oh wait, if You look way later in the chapter there is a table that explains she's the Goddess of the Sea (or rather that the Sea is her 'sphere').  Would it really have been that difficult to explain what each deity 'does'? Some of them actually say, but many of them just give a description of the God(dess)'s personality and leave it at that.  Its important to know what they actually DO when someone is creating flavor.  A sailor going out onto the ocean in poor weather might make a sacrifice of some kind to Umberlee as an appeasement, but if you don't know who the Goddess of the Sea is... you're fucked.<br />
<br />
The book <i>starts</i> with an adventure, which just leaves it as an absolutely horrible structure from there on out.  If you don't know anything about the Forgotten Realm setting beyond having read a few books, you'll need to buy this, buy the 3rd Edition Campaign Setting, buy the <i>Grand History of the Realms</i>, and then download the updates to the Grand History (I haven't looked, but I fucking hope it details the last 100 years better than the Campaign setting.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>everything that has happened up until 1479 DR</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != '') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = '';		this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none'; this.innerText = ''; this.value = 'Show'; }">

<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">

Era of Upheaval<br />
1358 DR to Present<br />
Scholars today mark the calamitous events of the Avatar Crisis in the Year of Shadows (1358 DR) as the start of the Era of Upheaval. Few in those early days could have possibly predicted that the physical and magical chaos of the Time of Troubles was merely a prelude to the Spellplague and the cataclysmic merging of two worlds that would follow. Though the union with Abeir was brief, its mark on Toril was significant and enduring. Even the gods themselves know fear for the first time in eons, for their numbers are diminished and the long-banished primordials have returned to oppose them and sow  chaos throughout the cosmos. 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
Yes, that's all the fucking tell you.  Now, there are a few other parts that go into history that do cover this information, bur you'd hope that &quot;history references&quot; such as Mystra being killed should be actually covered some where in detail in the fucking campaign guide.<br />
<br />
I wish I could give a full review, saying &quot;well, they did these few sections very well, and here's why I liked them&quot; but they didn't do ANY section well.  Its a complete travesty of organization, and it only gives HINTS at information, without actually giving the Dungeon Master any actual information without looking in a half dozen places.  Want to know whats going on in Thay? Turn to the index, then flip to those pages.  You'll have a few paragraphs at the start &quot;shit is bad in Thay,&quot; then you'll have to turn to the section on Thay, that explains what people live in Thay, the you'll have to flip to 150 pages later and read the section also creatively called &quot;Thay&quot; in the &quot;Threats&quot; chapter to find out exactly what has been going on in Thay, but even THEN, you're only left with enough information that you have to make it up on your own.  Its like they have some terror that they don't want to contradict anything that might happen in a novel, or that they don't want to accidentally spoil any information that's coming in a future novel.<br />
<br />
Elminster's section doesn't give stats on him, doesn't say whether he is still a spell caster, it just says he's &quot;diminished&quot; and &quot;immortal,&quot; and that he doesn't like talking with anyone anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I can appreciate the concept that you can create a rough framework for players to campaign in, and its up to the DM to fill in details as they want.  That works 'okay' for worlds that aren't filled in at all, but I have to wonder why you'd pay just to get a loose framework of &quot;bad shit happens here&quot; &quot;This city got changed pretty badly.&quot;  I always felt that the reason to pay for campaign setting books was so that you could either play in that campaign setting, or copy-paste sections into your own setting.  Need a set of islands that function like Moonsea? Just copy Moonsea out of FR, apply some name change magic, and you've got a chunk of your own world that the players can romp around in while you work out more details.  Try that with this 'campaign guide' and you're basically left with &quot;a bunch of islands.&quot;<br />
<br />
This just convinces me even more that the future of a good campaign setting is going to be a well written Wiki, and published settings are going to rot away.  If this is what WotC is going to publish for their campaign settings, players are better off just buying a copy of the 3rd Edition version, as it will be far less work for whichever method they plan on using.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Sorry if this is bloggish.<br />
<br />
I had two interviews today.  One was a phone interview, the other was in person.<br />
<br />
The phone interview went great, the company sounds really interesting, and I was told I'd be brought in for an in person based on the positive phone experience.  I'm looking forward to proceeding with that one.<br />
<br />
The in person interview was passable.  The technical questions all seemed to be about stuff I have little to no experience with, and I was asked few if any questions about stuff I DO have experience with.  I did check, I meet the majority of the criteria they are looking for based on the job description, but they possibly were not quite clear.  Mainly, I was asked a lot of database stuff, and the database is not my strong suit.  Anyway, I told the recruiter to proceed to the next step if it is available, but I'm just not really sure that I want to.  Or rather, I'm not sure that I am all that interested in the job they described, especially as compared to the one I had the phone interview for.<br />
<br />
I think I might have told the recruiter to proceed simply based on the fact that it is 'a job' and I don't have one.  Anyone else ever had that happen?</div>

Newegg plays chicken with New York 'Amazon Tax'<br />
By Cade Metz<br />
Published Monday 25th August 2008 22:09 GMT<br />
Defying New York lawmakers, &quot;egg-cellent&quot; electronics etailer Newegg.com has suddenly ceased collecting sales tax from the Empire State's online shoppers.<br />
<br />
Under Governor David Patterson's new $122bn budget, online retailers with New York-based affiliate marketers are considered to have a &quot;physical presence&quot; in the state, and that means they're officially required to collect and remit sales tax (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/14/new_york_legislature_approves_amazon_tax/" target="_blank">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04...es_amazon_tax/</a>) from New York-based buyers. When the new budget took effect on June 1, Newegg dutifully obeyed the so-called &quot;Amazon Tax,&quot; but late last week, it changed its mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;After careful review and consideration, we are pleased to inform you that we have stopped collecting New York sales tax, effective August 21, 2008,&quot; reads an email the company tossed at customers late last week, including at least one loyal Reg reader. &quot;This decision was driven by your direct and candid feedback and our continued commitment to you as our valued customers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Newegg - whose support line says it's committed to providing &quot;egg-cellent&quot; customer service - did not respond to repeated requests for comment. But a disclaimer tacked on to the end of that email seems to indicate that the company is questioning whether Patterson and the New York state legislature have exceeded their authority:<br />
<br />
Nothing in this email shall be deemed to approve the validity of any New York State law, including but not limited to section 1101(b)(8)(vi) of the New York State Tax Law, which purports to require Newegg to collect and remit New York State sales tax on its sales to residents of that state.<br />
Amazon and Overstock.com feel much the same way. Both etail giants are suing (<a href="http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2008/06/02/overstock_sues_new_york/" target="_blank">http://www.channelregister.co.uk/200...sues_new_york/</a>) the state of New York over the new tax law, insisting it's illegal under both the New York and United States Constitutions. A 1992 US Supreme Court decision says that retailers needn't collect sales tax unless they have a physical presence in the state where the customer resides. Otherwise, customers are required to declare the tax on their own (though few actually do).<br />
<br />
But neither Amazon nor Overstock has flat-out disobeyed New York lawmakers. Despite its opposition to the new law, Amazon is collecting NY state sales tax while its case plays out. Overstock never collected the Amazon Tax, but it severed its relationships with 3,400 New York-based affiliates just before the law took effect.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had two choices: Either raise our prices to New York residents or give up our New York affiliate business,&quot; free-thinking (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08/11/wikipedia_and_byrne_again/" target="_blank">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/08...d_byrne_again/</a>) Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne told us. &quot;And since our affiliates make up such a small fraction of our business, cutting affiliates made the most sense&quot;.<br />
<br />
But it would seem that Newegg has found a third option: Dare New York to sue them. ®
			
			<hr />
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>id love to see how this rolls out because the only way for NYS to really challenge Newegg is in a federal court and that means their law would come under the eyes of a federal judge which could make things interesting.  since newegg has no real presence in NYS its hard to bind them by the law, and of course how legal is the &quot;Amazon Law&quot;.</div>

Summary of the US Government's Financial Future<br />

<br />
Glenn Beck talking about Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid with the Comptroller General of the United States.<br />
[media]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-16u9x3tfE[/media]<br />
<br />
Presentation by the Comptroller General himself<br />
[media]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjZBOCAgR64&amp;feature=related[/media]<br />
<br />
<br />
Do any of you plan on using Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid in the future?  I recommend you don't think bargain on it.<br />
<br />
Here's some food for thought.<br />
<br />
- The US government owes $5 trillion to the public and $4 trillion to Social Security and other government trust funds.<br />
<br />
- In 2007, the US government budget was:<br />
<br />
Department of Defense - $665 billion<br />
Social Security - $626 billion<br />
Medicare and Medicaid - $556 billion<br />
Interest - $239 billion<br />
Other health - $111 billion<br />
Other government - $713 billion<br />
<br />
- Federal revenue over the past few years has been at 18% of GDP, regardless of tax levels.<br />
<br />
- To fully fund future obligations, $58 <b>trillion</b> needs to be invested now.  Current level: $0.<br />
<br />
- To prevent a disaster, it does seem that payroll taxes will need to be raised by at least 100%.  Would you like to pay 26% of your income in payroll taxes alone?  Or perhaps an increase in income tax of 74%?<br />
<br />
<br />
The US Comptroller General is doing a tour of states to warn them of the coming problems.  There is no precedent to this.<br />
<br />
How in the hell can anyone justify MORE government services, such as healthcare?  And on the same coin, how can anyone justifying tax cuts?  If anything, taxes need to be doubled unless people are willing to substantially reduce or eliminate SS, Medicare, and Medicaid.<br />
<br />
This is scary.  Remember, you <b>always</b> have to pay, whether it is now or later.  And it is coming.</div>

				The Rhone: France's poisoned artery  <br />
<br />
By Emma Jane Kirby <br />
BBC News, Port St Louis  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Beneath the waters of the Rhone, which flows through some of France's key tourists spots - from Lyon, to Avignon and on to the Camargue nature reserve - lurks an environmental disaster so grave that it has been described as &quot;the French Chernobyl&quot;. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Since the scare, the Manoukian family sell few freshwater fish at their stall <br />
Jean Luc Fontaine's backyard is an Aladdin's cave of nets, eel traps, bait boxes and buoys. <br />
<br />
His three fishing boats, caked in dust, are propped up on trailers, with stale-smelling fishing nets spilling over the edge. <br />
<br />
Mr Fontaine peers inside one of the boats and swishes his hand in a puddle of stagnant water that has collected on the bottom. <br />
<br />
&quot;All this equipment has just been lying here rotting for over a year,&quot; he told me. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've been a river fisherman for 25 years and all this stuff here is my life.&quot; <br />
<br />
He threads his fingers through one of the nets. &quot;I made some of this stuff with my own hands. One day I was working, the next I was just told to stop.&quot; <br />
<br />
Along the length of the Rhone, from Lyon down to the Camargue estuary, river fisherman have been ordered by the French government to moor up their boats. <br />
<br />
Last year, a dredge of the Rhone showed contaminated sediment in its bed and a local fisherman, concerned that birds seemed to be dying around the Grand Large area, just outside Lyon, sent some of his catch to a laboratory to be tested. <br />
<br />
The fish contained 12 times the legal safety limit of the toxic chemicals polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. <br />

Environmental pressure groups, convinced the pollution would be carried through the food chain, pressed the government to start screening humans and this summer scores of Rhone inhabitants were tested by Asef, an independent group of doctors who are increasingly concerned about the effects of pollution on human health. <br />
<br />
  <br />
 I've been a river fisherman for 25 years and all this stuff here is my life. All this equipment has just been lying here rotting for over a year <br />
<br />
Jean Luc Fontaine <br />
<br />
The results were alarming. Those who have regularly swum in or eaten fish from the river, often have 20 times more PCBs in their blood than those who have not. <br />
<br />
Sixty-five-year-old Dr Henri Ceresola spent much of his boyhood playing in the river at Arles and its perch, bream and eel have made up the principal part of his diet. <br />
<br />
A recent blood test showed he has 100 picogrammes of PCBs in his blood. Most of us have around 0-10 picogrammes. <br />
<br />
A few years back Dr Ceresola was diagnosed with cancer and, as a medical doctor, he is well aware that PCBs can cause not only infertility and birth defects in mammals, but also colon and breast cancers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a link between the pollution and my cancer?&quot; he asks. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know. But the government has known about the Rhone's pollution for a very long time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Time-bomb <br />
<br />
The Rhone cuts through France's biggest concentration of chemical industries. <br />
<br />
Since the 1920s, PCBs have been used in industry across the world in transformers, electrical generators and insulating fluid.  <br />
Freshwater fishermen have none of the political clout of seawater fishermen <br />
<br />
They were banned in 1986 after it was understood they posed a serious danger to human health, but they still leak from old electrical devices and hazardous waste sites. <br />
<br />
Environmental groups have been warning the government for years about the high levels of toxic chemicals that have leaked into the river water but, as recently as 1992, France was still allowing shipments of PCB-contaminated waste from Australia to be treated in a once government-owned industrial waste processing plant near Lyon. <br />
<br />
Campaigners say successive French governments have chosen to ignore what they call the &quot;ticking time-bomb&quot; of river pollution. <br />
<br />
At the mouth of the Rhone, in Port St Louis in the Camargue, the local people who have agreed to undergo testing show extremely high levels of PCBs in their blood. <br />
<br />
In the market place, where Andre Manoukian mans his fish stall, there are few freshwater fish in sight. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm always careful to label my fish, so customers know where it's come from,&quot; he says. &quot;I never buy from round here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Like most local people I talk to, he also points out that this PCB pollution scare is not new and wonders why the government has not acted faster to protect people from possible dangers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Water from the Rhone is used to irrigate crops and even the Camargue rice,&quot; he reminds me. &quot;We should be testing everything&quot;. <br />
<br />
Political clout <br />
<br />
At the small St Louis port, the sea fishermen are busy landing today's catch and putting it in ice-boxes ready for market. <br />
<br />
Less than a kilometre away at the estuary, the freshwater fishermen like Jean Luc Fontaine are surviving on government handouts. <br />
<br />
Mr Fontaine laughs bitterly when I ask him if the river fishermen plan to stage a protest. He reminds me there are simply not enough of them to blockade ports like their marine counterparts do and, unlike the sea fishermen, they have no political clout. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's shameful, shameful,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm nearly 50 years old and this river has been my life. Now I'm scared of the future.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tellingly, Mr Fontaine has declined an offer to have his blood screened.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, those of you that were in the beta/preview weekend, what are your overall impressions?  Will the game have legs once it's released?  Or will it be another Age of Conan, with high initial sales, but rapidly dropping subs?<br />
<br />
My impressions - keep this in mind, I didn't get any characters over level 8 in the preview, but I played 7 different classes spread across both factions:<br />
<br />
Things I liked:<br />
<br />
The game has a lot of things to like about it.  For one thing, this doesn't feel like a dead world, like so many games - there is stuff going on.  In the dark elf area, you have armies marching off the Black Ark and going off to battle, there is fighting all around, with NPCs taking on mobs, etc.  It *feels* like a war zone, which it is.  Other starting areas were the same way.<br />
<br />
Public quests are great, but all the ones I took part in were pretty much the same template:  wave 1: kill 30-75 small mobs, wave 2: kill 8-10 harder mobs, wave3: kill a big baddie.  Maybe higher tiered public quests are different, and I hope so, or PQs will get old quick.  But I love the idea behind them, and the fact that you earn Influence points that you can use for rewards is great - if you are unlucky (like me) and always lose the rolls for gear, you can still get stuff from your influence points.<br />
<br />
Open groups - I didn't see any open groups this weekend, so I have no idea how they work, but they sound like a great idea.<br />
<br />
Things I didn't like:<br />
<br />
I am getting tired of games that "hold my hand" and tell me where to go.  Sure, quests are nice, and level-appropriate content is nice, but I miss the older free form games where you explored and moved around the world on your own.  Instead of doing 3 quests here, then moving to the next town and doing 8 quests there, then moving on, etc.  And I know, I don't have to do the quests, but the content is set up in a way to move you along a certain path, whether you do the quests in a given area or not.  There are things to like about this method, but it also feels restrictive to me.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how long the game will last if there's not a lot of PvE content for people to consume.  PvP is fun, and it's good to have a game built around it, but after so many PvP battles it gets old and players will want something to do besides PvP.<br />
<br />
As good as the Public Quests are, I worry what's going to happen when server populations drop.  All the lower tier quests I took part in this weekend required groups to complete parts 2 and 3.  If there is no population in an area, those quests will go unfinished I think.  And that will be harder on new players who miss out on the initial wave of leveling.<br />
<br />
Overall I like the game and I will play it at least for the free month.  I'm concerned that the top tier content hasn't been shown yet, and the testers on that content are still under strict NDA - not a good sign - and if past games are any indication, there will be players ready for that content within a week or two of release.<br />
<br />
So, what are other peoples' thoughts? :)</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>After listening to the <a href="http://independentinsurgency.com/index.php?post_id=339453" target="_blank">Independent Insurgency interview of Michael Miller</a> I had to play test Serial. I won't link to the Serial &quot;site&quot; because it's terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible. I can only hope it gets better.<br />
<br />
The basic pitch for the game is that you play the potential victims and the investigators of a serial killer.<br />
<br />
The kicker for the game is that it's taught to you by means of 14 audio files and a two page pdf.<br />
<br />
The time limit for getting a play test done was coming up fast so we put Burning Firefly on hold a week (where last week my Psychologist learnt that you can mindfuck Reavers only at the cost of picking up <i>Cannibalistic Tendencies</i> on his sheet) to run this as a one shot.<br />
<br />
After batting it around for a few minutes We decided that the profile would &quot;chefs&quot;. Don't ask me why -- students, gamers, midgets, and real estate agents were also tossed around. We dwelt a little much on profiles that you wouldn't immediately feel sympathy for -- game show hosts, lawyers, accountants and so forth.<br />
<br />
We made our characters and their hopes:<ul><li>Cliff Collins -- wants to host his own successful TV show</li>
<li>Todd Barlow -- wants to own his own restaurant</li>
<li>Cindy Chen -- wants to bring her son over from Taiwan</li>
<li>Svengali Brensk -- wants to create a dish his mentor approves of</li>
</ul><br />
And then the blood started hitting the floor -- all the characters had an obstacle from each of the other players. The way it turned out was that we were -- hilariously -- one-upping each other on screwing each other's characters over.<br />
<br />
Cliff turned out to be pug ugly, a wife beater, and yet his sweet, sweet body was wanted by the head of the cooking channel.<br />
<br />
Todd turned out to be a gambler, have a vindictive ex-wife, and no right thumb.<br />
<br />
Cindy turned out be an activist in the black books with the government back home, have a drunk wastrel husband, and her kid was enrolled in a government program for kid geniuses.<br />
<br />
And Svengali turned out to have no sense of smell, his wife having an affair with his mentor, and about to be deported.<br />
<br />
We then went around the table with people doing scenes where they tried to overcome the obstacles in the way of their hope. The player whose scene it was played themselves, and dishing out roles in the scene to the other players. Like when Cliff went to pitch his show to the cooking channel my wife was the head of it (&quot;Andrew, call me Ann&quot;) I was her PA and the other guy was the head of the network. Svengali threw his wife out after discovering her affair with his mentor and became a better artiste through brooding, Cliff got predated on by &quot;Ann&quot; without getting anything out of it, Cindy convinced her husband to give up the sauce for their kid, and Todd got his thumb chopped off by mobsters and squicked out his investor by trying to carry on being head chef with the stump and leaking blood onto a plate.<br />
<br />
Simply put, hilarious stuff. The mechanics of it were really simple -- roll even you overcame that obstacle, odd you didn't. The fun of it was turning the dial up to eleven in making life hard for the poor bastard on the receiving end.<br />
<br />
Then there was the investigation phase where we flipped into the investigators and for every even roll on our five six sided dice made up clues. I was the Crime Scene Technician and found traces of blood and tire tracks and so forth. Thumbs up to my wife at being the psychic and getting surly at the ribbing from the detective.<br />
<br />
I think my having listened to the podcast helped here, as I had a vague idea of what to do with the evidence chains. The basic idea is that for four players mean that you have to have five successful evidence chains -- the more bits of evidence in a chain, the more likely it is to be successful. So we were riffing on the ritualistic parts of the murder, the strength required to execute it, the significance of it happening in the kitchen, and the carefulness of the murderer in covering his tracks.<br />
<br />
After that we went to another round of character struggles. Svengali managed to not get deported, Cindy browbeat her consulate into agreeing her file was too old to be relevant, Todd managed to get a respite from the gangsters chasing him, and Cliff got taken to the cleaners by his wife's vicious lawyer Alan Shaw-ing him in the face.<br />
<br />
Then the first PC envelope got opened, and it was my character, Svengali. <i>Nooooooooo!</i><br />
<br />
This cheered up the other players remarkably, who didn't seem to think a tortured artist of a chef was very sympathetic!<br />
<br />
We then went to investigation mode, and did pretty well with the investigation -- we had a witness. We had tox screens! We had more ritualistic elements! And we had a suspect -- my character's mentor. The other players took great delight in saying that this horrible man who stole my wife was showing great endurance while being interviewed and they could see what she saw in him.<br />
<br />
We actually had a good enough case to try and make the roll to see if he was the killer -- and he was!<br />
<br />
The players then voted on whether the survivors got their hopes in the epilogue. Cindy got her boy, and Cliff got his show at great cost to his soul, but Todd got a bullet in the back of the head after stringing his loan sharks on for too long.<br />
<br />
All in all, two and half hours of awesome. There are a few rough edges here and there, but I'm hoping that they'll get smoothed out in the gap between the playtest and production ready phases.</div>

				With the release of Wrath of the Lich King approaching, we wanted to provide you with some important information. In preparation for the expansion, we will be issuing a new content patch in the coming weeks. Much like the patch made available shortly before The Burning Crusade's release, this content patch is designed to bridge current game content with that of the expansion and will contain some exciting changes and additions.<br />
<br />
We have outlined some of the larger features scheduled to release with the patch below:<br />
<br />
New class spells and talents<br />
Stormwind Harbor<br />
Barbershops in capital cities<br />
Zeppelin towers outside of Orgrimmar and Tirisfal Glades<br />
Two brand-new Arenas featuring challenging new layouts, terrain hazards, and moving obstacles<br />
Guild calendar<br />
Hunter pet skill revamp<br />
New profession: Inscription<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, this is not a comprehensive list, just some of the major highlights. We’ll post the full patch notes as soon as they’re available. Regarding Inscription, please note that all Burning Crusade players will be able to select Inscription as one of their two professions and level up to a skill level of 375 with it. Upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King, players who purchase and install the expansion will be able to continue leveling in Inscription and the other professions beyond 375.

			<hr />
			
				    &quot;The rigorous studies clearly show red-light cameras don't work,&quot; said lead author Barbara Langland-Orban, professor and chair of health policy and management at the USF College of Public Health. &quot;Instead, they increase crashes and injuries as drivers attempt to abruptly stop at camera intersections.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Comprehensive studies from North Carolina, Virginia, and Ontario have all reported cameras are associated with increases in crashes. The study by the Virginia Transportation Research Council also found that cameras were linked to increased crash costs. The only studies that conclude cameras reduced crashes or injuries contained &quot;major research design flaws,&quot; such as incomplete data or inadequate analyses, and were always conducted by researchers with links to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The IIHS, funded by automobile insurance companies, is the leading advocate for red-light cameras since insurance companies can profit from red-light cameras by way of higher premiums due to increased crashes and citations.<br />
<br />
And, of course, the agenda of the government is to increase revenue due to fines:<br />
<br />
    A 2001 paper by the Office of the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives reported that red-light cameras are &quot;a hidden tax levied on motorists.&quot; The report came to the same conclusions that all of the other valid studies have, that red-light cameras are associated with increased crashes and that the timings at yellow lights are often set too short to increase tickets for red-light running. That's right, the state actually tampers with the yellow light settings to make them shorter, and more likely to turn red as you're driving through them.<br />
<br />
    In fact, six U.S. cities have been found guilty of shortening the yellow light cycles below what is allowed by law on intersections equipped with cameras meant to catch red-light runners. Those local governments have completely ignored the safety benefit of increasing the yellow light time and decided to install red-light cameras, shorten the yellow light duration, and collect the profits instead.<br />
<br />
    The cities in question include Union City, CA, Dallas and Lubbock, TX, Nashville and Chattanooga, TN, and Springfield, MO, according to Motorists.org, which collected information from reports from around the country.
