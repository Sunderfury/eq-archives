			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hrm.<br />
I have upgraded my own PC to Windows 10, and need to upgrade my sons PC as well.<br />
<br />
But my wife's PC - that's a different beast.<br />
She runs the full Adobe suite - the non-CC one which requires no subscription - and I REALLY don't want to risk her machine going &quot;Oh, whoops! This version of the program will not work with Windows 10, tee hee!&quot;.<br />
<br />
She uses her machine EXCLUSIVELY for Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign work, so if they go bye-bye and insist on going to a subscription model, it's useless.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Windows 7 will become less secure over time, since they will stop shipping security updates.<br />
<br />
Decisions, decisions...<br />
<br />
Any and all opinions appreciated.</div>
