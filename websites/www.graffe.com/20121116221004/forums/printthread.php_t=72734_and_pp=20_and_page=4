well for replayability you can vary difficulty (Ironman if want) and though there's only a set number of maps in game, every time you do a map, they vary the detials (spawn points, entrance etc)<br />
<br />
1) Demo is out now on steam! alas only two maps, and first one is the tutorial<br />
<br />
2) Scotland is a seperate country from UK and has own soldiers/flag etc, WOOT! <br />

		<blockquote class="restore">The X-Com game isn't going to bust any computer guts. It was designed to function on the XBox 360 and PS3 so the graphics actually look dated by about 4 or 5 years. However, for a game like this it isn't as important since the fun is in the strategy, not the eye candy. The gameplay is everything I've been craving and more. Crysallids are still as frustrating as ever. Nothing like having one of those fucking things charge all the way across the room and still have time to turn your Captain into a zombie. /sigh<br />
<br />
Still, my initial rating is to give it an A-. Everything under the hood works great, but they did miss on the minor details. Nothing that breaks the game, but those nice touches that give a game polish. For instance, there's a med bay in the base that apparently serves no purpose. Ok, that's where your soldiers go to get healed up but it would have been cool to be able to click on the med bay and zoom in to see your guys in recovery. I would have liked to see your soldiers doing something different in the barracks (currently it's just standard filler that never changes. Same two dudes running on the treadmill, same people in the bar, etc.<br />
<br />
It would have been nice if they would have given accents to the people from different nationalities. When I have a Japanese dude or some French chick it would be nice if they didn't have a perfect American accent. I'm sure money prevented that but whatever. Finally, the other minor thing I found is that when I arrive at a site and it is day time, it should be day time when I'm on the mission. The original did this very effectively. Why are all of my missions at night, even when it's not?</blockquote>

Another Easter Egg, apparently if you name your guys after the creators of the game you get super overpowered characters. For instance, type in &quot;Sid Meier&quot; and he's got like 200 will and fully loaded in psionics and such.<br />
<br />
Oh, and a correction to an earlier post, apparently you can zoom in on individual rooms. For some reason I couldn't earlier but I noticed an update when I logged in last night so maybe it was a bug they fixed.</blockquote>

</div>Note that this disables achievements.  There are a couple other names that'll spawn super soldiers as well.  Ken Levine is one of 'em, but I forget the other two.<br />
<br />
Some tips from someone in about six months.  I'll try my hardest to keep it spoiler free, but frankly, the story isn't exactly the biggest selling point of the game.<br />
<br />
1.  First thing out of the gate, budget resources to building satellites.  They take a long time to build, but are what make you money and help keep panic levels down.  If you wait to start building, you going to pay for it long term.<br />
<br />
2.  On the flip side, don't launch satellites right away.  Wait until the end of the month, just before the council report.  You might get lucky and have a terror or abduction occur that will drop panic for you in that troubled country.  For example, I had Japan about to bail on the project.  I launched my satellite and saved Japan.  Abductions happened right after, and Japan was one of the options.  The other two were nowhere near leaving.  Net result:  Mexico is a gigantic red mark on my permanent report card.  Had I waited, I could've saved Japan via abduction and used the satellite for Mexico after it got upset about Canadians being abducted.<br />
<br />
3.  Capture aliens.  Seriously, do it.  I find that Support make the best soldiers for this task, due to their long movement and (eventually) Deep Pockets skill.  Producing plasma weapons is insanely expensive, and capturing an alien gives you unique research boosts for each race.  <br />
<br />
4.  Progress the story until the alien base assault.  Destroying a base results in a -2 panic drop in <i>every</i> country.  This will be key for keeping everyone happy at all times.  If you stall on the story, you'll find yourself losing countries since abductions raise panic in entire regions, but only reduce in the single country.  (Example; if an abduction happens in Canada, and you go to Japan's instead for the sweet, sweet scientists, then panic will rise in Canada, USA, and Mexico.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, I really like the class system.  Gives you a lot of flexibility on how you build your team.<br />
<br />
Assaults are great early game, but I find they drop off in usefulness quickly.  At first, mine was a killing machine with Run and Gun, but now I mainly use him to attract fire, since his high defense tends to keep him safe. Flush is a great skill that I love to use.<br />
<br />
Heavies are the opposite, for me.  I have two that I rely upon quite a bit.  Up to three shots a turn (rare, but happens), and suppression is great.  Rockets are wonderful too, since my main super star is a...<br />
<br />
Sniper.  Goes from worthless to great in a single promotion.  Seriously; a rookie is better than a squaddie sniper.  But that first promotion, squadsight, is downright beastly.  I have a colonel sniper now that accounts for 75% of my kills in a given mission.  Get on top of a truck with clear line of sight, and then use everyone else to spot.  He racks up kills like nothing else.<br />
<br />
Support are my backbone.  I use two, since I like to run around spotting for the sniper.  Also, I play fast and loose, and having the extra healing is helpful.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">i like using Assaults with laser shotguns and the grappling  abiulity of the skeleton armour, let's you get up close and BOOM SHAKKA :P<br />
but yes, SNipers are bad ass, but don't neglect to upgrade their pistol skills, as sniper rifles suck up close, ie indoors within 30 feet or so<br />

		<blockquote class="restore">Crysallids can DIAF  seriously.   My most successful kill method on them is to surround a choke at medium range and put people on overwatch and then they die one by one as they come out the choke.  Lasers do remarkable damage to them and at one square distance... you do not want to be the bug that meets a scatter laser point blank and then the sniper laser 20 squares away.</blockquote>
