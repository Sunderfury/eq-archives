			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>October is another packed month. The big titles this month are a scattershot of interesting titles, so while it doesn't seem to have that one monster release that will attract everyone's attention, it has enough assorted new releases to appeal to several niches.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I an overestimating the franchise or not, but I'm going to say the Xone's big exclusive, <b>Halo 5: Guardians</b>, is the biggest game this month. Halo 4 got a rocky reception, but from what little I've seen I think they are putting a lot into this title and I will be interested in seeing how that works out for them. <br />
<br />
And yeah, I'm sort of snubbing <b>Assassin's Creed Syndicate</b> for this position. As a multiplatform game and a AAA title, it would have top billing for this position if Ubisoft didn't have so much to prove with it. And honestly, the problems they had with last year's title might not have hurt them so bad if they weren't also stretching this franchise thin with too many releases.<br />
<br />
This is also the year (and month) when music games <STRIKE>make</STRIKE> attempt a comeback. <b>Guitar Hero</b> and <b>Rock Band</b> both make a return, with a couple key differences. 1) Rock Band is coming out on the new platforms only (PS4/Xone), Guitar Hero is coming out on everything. 2) Rock Band is attempting to make old controllers and old DLC songs compatible with the new game, while Guitar Hero is changing things up and attempting some new things instead. That's the most I know about either. I'm not big on the genre, but if you are be sure to find out all the improvements and differences.<br />
<br />
Also worth mentioning: <b>Minecraft Story Mode</b> (A Telltale adventure) and <b>Transformers: Devastation</b>. The latter is being done by Platinum (Bayonetta) and I'm sort of expecting the quality to be that of a budget release, but if you are a Transformers fan it's still worth geeking out on. Platinum are masters of the action genre, and this game is using an art style reminiscent of the original series rather than the newer stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
While the Xbox has the biggest single exclusive, the PS4 has the greatest quantity. It's a little absurd, and fans of Japanese games in particular should be happy. Japan seems to be taking to the PS4 faster than they did the PS3. First, <b>Disgaea 5</b> for strategy rpg fans, <b>Tales of Zestiria</b> for jrpg fans, and <b>Dragon Quest Heroes</b>, a mashup of Dragon Quest characters in the Dynasty Warriors action style. Throw an Uncharted port Collection on as the cherry on top for anyone who didn't play those games on PS3.<br />
<br />
The Wii U gets another notable title this month with <b>Yoshi's Wooly World</b>. Though I've never found Yoshi particularly fun to control, the art style is fantastic. This game has been a long time in coming, and it's kind of unfortunate how obviously overlooked it will be. The Wii U also looks to be getting another Fatal Frame game, a generally solid horror series.<br />
<br />
<br />
While big console releases are becoming more frequent, solid handhold titles are drying up a bit. The most notable is probably <b>Triforce Heroes</b> on the 3DS, a three player cooperative Zelda game. The Vita is meanwhile getting <b>Corpse Party: Blood Drive</b>, an entry in a cult classic anime horror adventure series.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, not much for PC this month. The biggest new PC release in my mind is shared with the PS4: <b>Tales of Zestria</b>. This is a fairly big deal for fans of Japanese games. They are becoming more commonly ported to Steam/PC lately, and this is a big one. It's part of a new trend where you don't necessarily need a console if you love jrpgs. They are also porting the classic Tales of Symphonia over in the process, which just opens the door for even more possibilities.<br />
<br />
Also, while I have not seen many people talking about it, a nifty little game called <b>Read Only Memories</b> is due this month. This is a classic point and click adventure game with an 80s cyberpunk motif. Everything about the art style and graphics is incredibly nostalgic. It is also notable for broadening LGBT representation in video games. <br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've posted about this a few times before. Every now and then EA gives away a free classic game as a way to get people to try their Origin service. It's basically advertising, as when you log in to download your free game you also happen to see their banners proclaiming whatever new release they have coming up is available for pre-order.<br />
<br />
At any rate, if you like RTS games and never tried it, or already own it physical and would like a digital version, Red Alert 2 along with it's expansion are free at the moment. There was a brief issue where demand was too high and they ran out of keys, but it's available again now.<br />

<br />
As the title states, the game has been delayed, though supposedly the core is done and they are just tuning gameplay now. The trailer they showed off backs this up; the game basically looks finished. Pretty good trailer. I'm adding links to both the original Japanese trailer and a version with English subtitles made by fans. Atlus has this thing where they pretend they don't understand how the internet works and will issue takedowns on fan translations of their trailers so they can produce their own versions later. It's weird.<br />
<br />
English Subtitled:<br />

In related news, this was announced and shown during the Tokyo Game Show this year. I don't think I'll make a thread for it, but it seems to be a better year than usual, with plenty of stuff we may look forward to in the future.</div>
