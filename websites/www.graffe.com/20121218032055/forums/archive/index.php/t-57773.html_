I've taken one -- for excel.  In my case, it was just a preliminary screen to see if I knew what I claimed to know on my resume.  Sadly, the questions and interface conspired to make me get one task wrong.  That didn't matter, I still got a call back.  But, it pissed me off that I got a simple excel task wrong on this test.  <br />
<br />
It seemed like the system is set up to let the interviewer/headhunter ask you to run through some basic tasks in some software, so there probably aren't archive questions to review.  However, the excel stuff was pretty basic, just enough to confirm that I knew how to use the software (sorting, formatting, simple calculations, etc.).<br />
<br />
An SQL test will probably require you to write up a few commands against a test database.  I'd be surprised if they got into a lot of detail or requested you do anything terribly complex.</div></div><hr />

Quite comical as Ive seen it happen... And eventually watched the guy get fired.<br />

Not really much help, sorry</div></div><hr />

If the right people are administering the test, it works just like a good interview.<br />
Typically however, these are billed as &quot;hands-off&quot; hiring process screens, and hands-off never works all that well in the hiring process.</div></div><hr />

One of my co workers types at around 150 WPM, its humorous how much it confuses my boss.<br />
<br />
He has an ability I don't though, and it slows my typing down a little bit.   I can't type from dictation very well, because I actually think about what I'm writing down.  When he's typing from dictation he'll write whatever you tell him, even if you're just stringing together random words, or my favorite: &quot;conf t return. &lt;stuff&gt; end. return. exit. return. exit. return.&quot;  it usually takes him a few confused seconds to wonder where his window just went.</div></div><hr />

Say no ill words about that software. I cling to my 115 wpm as a bright point of light in my otherwise dim existence.</div></div><hr />

Yah I was aware of all that stuff.  I think they had 700 questions on full outside joins, which I never do period because when you're working with a few hundred thousand records in each table that's generally a good way to get some DBA yelling at you.  Since my degree was never in software development I screwed up a lot of the theory stuff.  Oh well, I don't think I would have liked that job anyhow.  I just HATE not doing well on an exam.  Thinking maybe I'll take an intro class on SQL at a community college to force myself to read the theory stuff.  My training has been &quot;fetch or alter this data for this purpose&quot;.</div></div><hr />
