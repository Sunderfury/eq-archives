WEENIES! <br />
<br />
Back in my day, You rolled what you rolled and what did you do? <br />
<br />
YOU ROLLED WITH IT. LITERALLY.<br />
<br />
This isn't my fucking old man rose colored glasses that I put on when I think of Dark Elf booty and my Staff of Trascendant Flux. I grew a lot in over 20 years and I come back to this genre and find everyone is a fucking robot that thinks the game is a JOB, the characters are doing JOBS and everything is a fucking DRAG and bad characters are bad and blah blah blah meermeermeermmer<br />
<br />
Jesus Christ...<br />
<br />
Players today are like, they think they need to win the PnP game and things that aren't the dice-related are fluff - don't matter.<br />
<br />
That shit is what makes the story go! It's what decides what you as the player fucking do with your character! ITS NOT FLUFF. NOTHING IS FLUFF.<br />
<br />
FLUFF.<br />
This fucking word did not exist in my day. Get bent, kiddos. Your videogames have rotted your brains.<br />
<br />
Just wait - I'm hosting games, now. This whining shit isn't gonna stand. I'm too fucking old so I am super hippie dippie I love roleplaying, but there's a fucking dark side. I AM A SON OF A BITCH AND I DON'T WANNA HEAR YOUR FUCKING WHINING ABOUT THE GAME.<br />
<br />
PLAY THE GODDAMNED GAME. ACT LIKE YOU GIVE A SHIT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING.</div>
