I'm a whopping few weeks out of date for this model, but it's not an oft-used one either due to it's low price point and slight under-performance for comparable phones.<br />
<br />
I provide the phone information because it is the phone provided to me by my workplace, for free, and I have some permission to do things, but the basic principle is &quot;if you break it, you have to fix it&quot; and I know very, very, very little about un-bricking bad flashes in android phones so this is the phone I'm stuck with for now, as-is for the purposes of this thread, if at all possible.<br />
<br />
(Evo Design 4G -- note the word &quot;design&quot;, which makes it different from an evo 4g, apparently phone forums get confused over that. Carrier is sprint, version is 2.12.651.8 710 RD, HTC sense version 3.0, PRI Version 2.97_003 PRL version 2.97_003 if that helps. I'm loathe to update anything because sprint/htc/someone are apparently adamant brats about firmware flashing with this model and so seem to fight heavily against it.)<br />
 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
<br />
I connect to an exchange 2010 server at work. I have an android 2.3.4 version, an htc sense 3.0 version, and I'd really like to be able to access the global address list from my phone when I start a new message and tap the text field next to &quot;To:&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'd even settle for a way to sync the local contacts on my work PC after I manually add them as contacts from the Global Address Book to the phone (A better way to do this would also be welcome) because even that level of contact syncing isn't working at the moment.<br />
<br />
I can't find the ability to sync contacts in any of the folder sync settings, so I may be out of luck, but aside from looking into stuff like xobni (which is an app band-aid) I can't see a way to fix this.<br />
<br />
I also may be missing something very simple because I suck at smartphones.<br />
<br />
Help?</div>

<b><font size="4">Obamacare Repeal Vote Coming in House For 31st Time</font></b><br />
<br />
The House of Representatives will take up a largely symbolic vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act Wednesday, an act some lawmakers are comparing to Groundhog Day<br />
<br />
By Lauren Fox <br />
<br />
In the House of Representatives, it seems Republican leadership is hoping to run out the clock.<br />
<br />
With just 15 days left to legislate before the August recess, House leadership isn't scurrying to pass job creation legislation or curb the looming &quot;fiscal cliff,&quot; Instead, lawmakers are devoting their time to largely symbolic votes like repealing the Affordable Care Act, the 31st time such a vote has taken place.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are demonstration projections and there are also demonstration votes,&quot; says Larry Sabato, Director for the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. &quot;It is to let your party base know you are with them and to force your opponents to vote the other way.&quot;<br />
<br />
While the &quot;Repeal Obamacare Act&quot; is expected to pass in the House with a sweeping majority, Senate leadership is unlikely to ever bring it to the floor, nor would it ever pass under the Democratic majority.<br />
<br />
But that hasn't kept the House from spending the first half of this week on the measure. The House Rules Committee met to formulate the healthcare repeal language Monday and the debate on the &quot;Repeal of Obamacare Act&quot; began early Tuesday morning, with a vote expected Wednesday. And in case that isn't enough time, the effects of Obamacare on doctors and patients was also debated for several hours Tuesday in two separate committees.<br />
<br />
But while the actions of House Republicans make it look as though they are serious about repealing healthcare, even they know their actions are futile.<br />
<br />
Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price said Tuesday during a breakfast hosted by two leading GOP Super PACs that Republicans aren't expecting the 31st time to be charm.<br />
<br />
&quot;We believe in an open, deliberative, rational, bipartisan process, and that's the process that we will go through when we are given the privilege of leading in this town,&quot; Price said. &quot;We continue to be the minority party and consequently we've got to wait until we're the majority party to get this done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso agrees there is no chance the House could repeal healthcare until after the election, assuming Republicans gain control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can imagine Harry Reid will try to block any of those type of votes,&quot; Barrasso said. &quot;The president would obviously veto it. To be able to really repeal this legislation, we need a new president and a new majority in the Senate, just to 51, to use the budget reconciliation process and keep the House.&quot;<br />
<br />
Healthcare isn't the only topic the House is taking up this week.<br />
<br />
House committees are spending time on how to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement better curb illegal immigration and examining the impact of the Dodd-Frank bill, which Republicans have often called a &quot;job killer.&quot;<br />
<br />
The House Judiciary Committee will also mark up &quot;the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act&quot; Tuesday, legislation that would prohibit abortions at 20 weeks gestation or later in Washington, D.C.<br />
<br />
&quot;An entire year has been wasted on things like this,&quot; a Senior Democratic leadership aide said. &quot;We've focused on partisan politics as opposed to the nation's business.&quot;<br />
<br />
House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Larson says many House Republicans have decided it is more important to see Obama fail than see America succeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are caught in this perpetual Groundhog Day,&quot; Larson said. &quot;It is the lack of no jobs agenda while 14 million Americans are out of work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Democrats have worked to frame Republicans as run amok obstructionists who have used their majority in the House to promote conservative principals over compromise.<br />
<br />
During a Monday speech to discuss new manufacturing jobs legislation at the Center for American Progress, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer told the audience that Republicans had broken their promise to the American people that they were going to bring &quot;substantive&quot; legislation to the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Cantor said some weeks ago he didn't think much was going to be done between now and the election,&quot; Hoyer said. &quot;I think that is unfortunate. America's challenged, people are out of jobs, people are anxious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I tell people there was a hostile takeover of the corporation of which I'm a member. I'm now a minority stock holder,&quot; Hoyer said with a smirk.<br />
<br />
<br />
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>Absolutely ridiculous.  So much important work that needs to be done on infrastructure, tax codes, job creation FFS, student loans, etc and John Boehner and the rest of the chuckle heads in the GOP prefer to vote for the 31st time to repeal a law that's been upheld by the Supreme Court.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I'm just mind-boggled how these people get elected...<br />
<br />
:banghead:</div>

He has awards from the Air Force, Army and Coast Guard.  This is one area I think the SCOTUS made a wrong decision. They basically made it legal to lie about military service.  Their decision came from a different case but this guy's uniform is hilarious on how wrong it is.  <br />

<br />
I do agree that most of the regulation needs to be cut and just let the States do their own regulation, especially enviro Reg. I think laws like the Glass-Segal anti-trust anti-monopoly need to stay/reenacted or laws created against the abuse of money in government. To put it in simple terms, &quot;does this law keep the playing field even?&quot; Would be a great way to test and measure a law. Laws that are intended to protect the consumer, but big corps can just brush off while it cripples or destroys the smaller business hurts everyone except the 1% in the long run. The Glass-Segal law was great, because it was a hard and fast law that the two types of investments shall not ever touch, didnt matter if you were big or small, no meant no. Laws that say &quot;well you have to pay this and this and then the answer is yes,&quot; are bad.<br />

One of my main points about this thread is that regulation is not simply good or bad, but most regulation over the past 20 years has been bad becuase it makes for an unfair playing field.</div>

<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">Welcome to the inaugural The Secret World State of the Game update!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">(Right, so that's a mouthful. In the future, I think I'll shorten it to TSWSotG, because that's a LOT easier to remember.)</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">We've had an exciting first week, and we're thrilled to see that everything has gone incredibly smooth so far. There have been some bugs and issues, of course, and we're fixing those as quickly as we can, but things are really stable and our players -- you guys! -- are very, very happy with the game. And that makes us very happy, too!</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">Now that players are progressing further and further into the game, uncovering all those things we've managed to keep secret for years and years, we're starting to see a lot of questions about what's next. What does the future hold for The Secret World, for our players and subscribers?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">Well, I'm finally allowed to reveal a FEW of the things we're working on, and I'm really excited to be talking about what's ahead for The Secret World.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">We're going to be releasing fresh and tasty new content FREE to our subscribers on a regular, monthly basis. The first update is due on Tuesday, July 31st, and we will be releasing more details about that particular update later this week -- including a couple of fun surprises. (You're going to love it.)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">So what will these updates contain? I'm glad you asked! I won't spoil too much, but here's an overview of some of the things we have in the pipelines:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* Mission packs on a monthly basis! The first few packs will contain new investigations for every adventure zone in the game -- but we also have more action and sabotage missions planned for the near future. These missions will feature fully voiced cut-scenes and new media pop-ups, and will match the quality of the missions currently in the game. Oh, and like everything else in our monthly updates, these packs are FREE for our subscribers!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* New weapons! We will be announcing our first auxiliary weapon soon (one clue: bigger, slower, more explosions) and new auxiliary weapons will be released on a regular basis. Combat in The Secret World will continue to evolve, and it will pay to expand your character in multiple directions!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* Raids! We're well into production on our first raid, and there will be more information about that in August! But as a teaser: The Big Apple will never be the same</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* We've already announced our plans for expanding and improving character customisation: The Modern Prometheus and Ockham's Razor are opening in New York and London respectively in August, Execution later this year in Seoul. Pangaea in London will receive new stock, and we will add more accessories and clothing as rewards for both achievements and missions</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* Chronicle has entered public beta, and we'll keep enhancing and growing that service according to player needs and wishes! Our intent is for Chronicle to become a living, breathing community in itself, and a place where players will go to measure and compare themselves against others, to check out the profiles of their co-players and rivals, and -- in the long run -- to become a living chronicle (zing!) of their player characters</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* We have a player-versus-player dungeon in the early stages of planning -- in a brand new geographical area. More on this later this year!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* And speaking of dungeons, we're also working on a dungeon finder tool, allowing players to more easily put together a team to handle the instanced content</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* Seasonal events won't go unnoticed in the secret world, and both Halloween and the Winter Solstice are important milestones for those who dabble (and dive deep into) the occult. Expect plenty of content to tie into both events -- including new missions, new characters, new monsters and some twists and turns that will keep players on their toes</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* We're in production on two large, new and incredibly exciting adventure zones -- both of which will be announced in August. New geographical regions, new characters, new missions, new drops, new challenges, new monsters, new lore that will carry the story past its first act and into its thrilling and shocking second act!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* Improved cabal functionality is on the drawing board and will be seeing improvements later this year</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* And we're not forgetting about our social players! We have some cool functionality tied to the Albion in London coming up very soon, allowing role-players and would-be thespians to spread their wings</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* Pets will be updated and upgraded as we go along! More pets, better pets, and some cool surprises in store for pet owners!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">* And last but certainly not least: Combat will receive constant polish and tweaks to make things look and feel better. Keep an eye out for more revisions to our effects and animations this autumn -- and the inclusion of auxiliary weapons will make combat even more exciting!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">This isn't all. In fact, it's just the beginning, so stay tuned! The Secret World will keep growing, and there will always be a reason to go back to your favourite places, to dig deeper into the mysteries of Solomon Island, Egypt, Transylvania, New York, London and Seoul...and beyond.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Droid Sans">So stick around, folks -- there's tons more to come, both this week and in the very near future. Thanks for reading, and have fun playing the game!</span><br />

			<span style="font-family: Verdana">Hi all,</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">I'm really happy and excited to announce the first public beta of a shiny new feature we've been working on (in total secrecy!) for the past couple of months:</span><br />
<br />
<center><span style="font-family: Verdana"><b>Chronicle (<a href="http://chronicle.thesecretworld.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://chronicle.thesecretworld.com</a>)</b></span></center><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Chronicle is a record -- a chronicle! -- of your character's journey through the secret world, and includes a character profile together with a collection of leaderboards covering both PvE and PvP.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">We're launching our first public beta phase today, and everyone's invited! The service will remain in beta for the time being and contain a limited set of features, but Chronicle will continue to expand and grow together with our community and the game.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Chronicle allows you to look up character profiles on the net and, crucially, to size your character up against other players, everywhere. You can compare base profiles, and you can look up your friends and fellow cabalists and members of your secret society on the leaderboards to see who's ahead in what.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">On your profile page, you can see a selection of your stats -- such as ability wheel completion, your weapon and talisman skills, equipped actives and passives, and talismans, deck completion, faction rank, cabal, and a bunch of other achievements and stats. Your profile is currently updated once every twenty-four hours.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">On the leaderboards, you will be compared with players from across the world. We cap the lists at a low number, so you might not feature on all -- or any! -- of the leaderboards right now, but it will give you something to strive for, whether it's to compare yourself with friends and teammates, cabal members, your faction...or everyone. Hey, aim high! Think of the leaderboards as good, old-fashioned high-score lists.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Please note that your character must have been active within the past four days for the service to be activated. If you are having trouble finding your character, log into the game and log back out -- your character should now be updated on Chronicle.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">This is just the beginning for Chronicle. We have a lot of great features planned, and we will be integrating the service more with the game and also, hopefully, with mobile devices and social networks in the future. We are going to add more stats, more features, more leaderboards, and more user control. We might also look at giving rewards tied to your status and standing on Chronicle.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">This is still the first public beta phase for Chronicle, but we're making it accessible to everyone so that we can get your feedback and comments, and to allow you to start building your status and profile in The Secret World -- or to put it another way:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Start working on your own personal Chronicle!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Let us know what you think, and hopefully together we can shape Chronicle into an even better service as time goes on -- one that complements and enhances your enjoyment of the game, and your immersion into The Secret World.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Have fun, everyone!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Ragnar</span>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><b>Introduction</b><br />
<br />
So you want to roll a new class, and want a class with crazy looking abilities? Or maybe you are just tired of tryhards and baddies making your class look bad, and want to pick something that will never, ever, be flavor of the month? Then the witch doctor is for you! Or maybe it isn't. This class is so unpopular that people don't even mention it when discussing melee vs ranged class balance!<br />
<br />
I am by no means an expert, and don't have the patience to learn &quot;teh maths&quot; behind what makes for optimal builds, but I can share my experiences. I've been stuck in a single build for a pretty long time (which I will get into later), but sometime soon I might start experimenting again.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>my witch doctor</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">

</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
As you can see, do not pick this class if you want to look cool in armor. The hunched posture makes identifying armor characteristics hard, and when you do, it tends to resemble trash tied to his body with duct tape and twine. The pictures above aren't the best example of this, but it was the trend for most of the game. The male version also has a horrible twitching animation, as if he was bitten by the snake he is always carrying around. The class makes up for it by having some of the best hats though! When you aren't annoying your friends with useless frogs and spiders, annoy them by talking about your hat constantly instead! <br />
<br />
<b>Stats</b><br />
<br />
I'm not sure on the optimum stat priority. Unlike other classes, witch doctors don't really get many skill synergies with stats like crit. The one single synergy is for armor on a fear rune. My priority has always been on intellect, as for most of the game you will need to focus on killing the enemy before they can hit you. Even after the nerf I like attack speed though, as cast speed is a bit of a problem with this class.<br />
<br />
Defensive stats help when you can afford them, but do not give up too much intellect in the process. You need to develop the skills to not get hit in the first place, then you can worry about getting gear that prevents you from being one shotted. <br />
<br />
Below I will give an opinion on every skill, the builds I used for each difficulty, and finally a look at Inferno builds. Skip to whichever section interests you.<br />
<br />
<b>Class Rundown</b><br />
<br />
Witch Doctors are a ranged class that seem to specializing in controlling the enemy. They are arguably the weakest feeling class in the game, but are still capable of pulling off a few amazing feats once you learn how to play the class. <br />
<br />
Witch Doctors are the only class in the game that still uses mana, and it will make you thankful that every other class has abandoned it for a more interesting mechanic. Mana will be a limiting factor for most of the game, will force you to use less interesting spells, and rarely makes you truly feel powerful. <br />
<br />
Witch Doctors also have a problem with the casting time of spells. Or maybe it's the animations. I've seen a few complaints but I don't know the exact nature of the problem. While there are exceptions, you will feel like you are rooted to the ground while you play, and you will focus more on preventing the enemy from getting to you, than kiting them once they do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>skill rundown</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
<b>Primary</b><br />
<ul><li style="">Darts  - The most dependable damage dealing skill. Almost all of the runes are worth using at various times.</li><li style="">Corpse Spiders - Initially good for a laugh, aren't particularly useful for any situation, but that's not stopping people from trying.</li><li style="">Plague of Toads - Fun for awhile, but too unwieldy and unpredictable. I've heard of addling toads being used versus champion packs in Inferno, but generally the only useful rune is Rain of Toads. It does good damage when you get it, but is only good versus stationary enemies.</li><li style="">Firebomb - Pretty good alternative to Darts, so I used it up until Inferno, at which point it paled in comparison to Darts. I used Flash Fire up until Ghost Bomb at 60. Both do okay aoe damage so kill trash fast (pre-Inferno).<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Secondary</b><br />
<ul><li style="">Grasp of the Dead - A snare that doesn't serve much purpose early on, but becomes vital in Inferno. All of its runes are useful at some point or another.</li><li style="">Firebats - A popular witch doctor spell that I don't care for much myself. Sure it does okay damage, but it's a channeled melee range spell. How is that a good idea? The two exceptions are Dire Bat rune, which is quite good in narrow areas, and Hungry Bats which can be a stand in for zombie bears in certain builds.</li><li style="">Haunt - I wanted to like this. I really did. A dot that transfers to other enemies when the target dies? Sounds great, but it hasn't shown much effective use in the field. Has a few runes that provide a benefit to the witch doctor, but only useful when spammed, in which case you don't have time to damage enemies with more effective means. Not giving up on it yet. The one plus is that it tracks and seeks targets, so you can very easily kill fast and annoying monsters (wasps) with it.</li><li style="">Locust Swarm - One of my favorite spells, although it has two huge drawbacks. 1) Melee range cast, the opportunities to cast it without getting clobbered are few. 2) In Inferno, there's no room on my bar for it. You can also start to run into mana problems if you don't want to wait for an entire room to get infected. All of the runes are great. Cast it then go hide in a corner and wait for everything to die.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Defensive</b><br />
<ul><li style="">Summon Zombie Dogs - The reason most people rolled the class, and the reason most people quit. Witch Doctors are a pet class with terrible pets. Beyond normal, these are only good for exploding.</li><li style="">Horrify - Aoe Fear. As a crowd control it shows very limited use. It's a little too disorderly and unreliable for my liking, but it can be useful at times. Several useful runes.</li><li style="">Ghost Walk - Your single most powerful skill. Everything worth doing will revolve around it. At first glance it's just an extremely weak mobility spell, but in reality it is so much more. You can use it to escape frozen and jailer. You can use it to gain distance from enemies. You can use it offensively to use a close range spell without being hit. You can use it to tank a single hit. It's an amazing spell. Can be runed to return mana or health, and early on is worth using for that ability alone. In Inferno you need to be more prudent with when you use it though. It's major weakness is a 15 second long cooldown. Initially, you leave a body behind at the point of cast, and when it takes damage, Ghost Walk ends. It's possible to die instantly if a pack ends your spiritual journey early and you are still standing near the point of impact. Seems bugged, sometimes enemies will chase me in ghost form instead of focusing on the spirit body left behind like they are supposed to.</li><li style="">Hex - An extremely unreliable polymorph. It's useless for most of the game, but can be helpful in killing champion packs. Assuming the fetish actually works and doesn't just stand around doing nothing (it happens). It has the benefit of something like an 80% uptime, you just have to remember to keep casting it.<br />
<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Terror</b><br />
<ul><li style="">Soul Harvest - I didn't like this originally, but it has proven to be one of the most vital skills in the witch doctor arsenal. It is one of the only ways to increase your damage, and early on can be used as an extremely reliable heal. It basically gives you 100 or so intellect for every enemy you harvest, up to 5 enemies.</li><li style="">Sacrifice - Explodes your zombie dogs. Obviously only useful if you are also using zombie dogs. Moderately useful in a few situations.</li><li style="">Mass Confusion - This could have been one of the most powerful spells in the game, but sadly falls flat, and is generally only worth using for it's runes. Better crowd control than Horrify, it has one huge flaw (ignoring the ineffectiveness of cc in general): enemies that are confused will try to run to you before they try to engage any other enemies. Any enemies not confused will also run to you. This results in charm wearing off with the confused enemies having done nothing they wouldn't have done anyway, and they will all then all clobber you at once. Terrible terrible implementation. Just another broken skill. Can be runed to stun enemies, or cause them to take 20% extra damage.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Decay</b><br />
<ul><li style="">Zombie Charger - A generally terrible skill. Very slow, short range, huge mana cost. Bearly worth using until you get the zombie bears rune. (get it, hehehehe)</li><li style="">Spirit Barrage - Does good single target damage when you get it, but quickly becomes apparent that it simply costs too much mana to useful. None of the runes help, although I did experiment with using the very last rune to kite with or as a turret during boss fights, but the range is simply too small.</li><li style="">Acid Cloud - I almost like this skill as much as locust swarm. Huge aoe dd + dot, with several useful runes, and can be cast a range. Mana becomes a problem though in the later difficulties.</li><li style="">Wall of Zombies - Exactly what it sounds like, a barrier you can create between yourself and enemies. Not terribly useful early on, but pretty good in later difficulties. If you cast it on top of an enemy, you effectively root them in place. Has two inexplicably and hilarious damage runes that take away the cc aspect and make it a pure damage skill. Both have the highest damage in the game for their type, but are extremely unwieldy.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Voodoo</b><br />
<ul><li style="">Gargantuan - Your only good pet. I liked this one quite a bit, and it has several good runes. Starts dieing too fast to be useful near the end of Hell mode. Long cooldown.</li><li style="">Voodoo - An extremely useful spell both for you and for your party, but only for as long as champions don't chase you outside of the area of effect. Gives attack and movement speed, can be runed to give attack power, health, or mana. Has a long cooldown.</li><li style="">Fetish Army - Summons an army of tiny minions. Has a long cooldown. Initially very unimpressive, can be pretty useful in later difficulties. I'm actually not sure how much damage it does, but the minions distract and offtank enemies. Was essential to my solo of Inferno Belial because they blocked the poison attack in stage 2.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Passives</b><br />
<ul><li style="">Circle of Life - Whenever enemies near you die, there is a small chance a zombie dog will spawn. It will just immediately die, so skip this.</li><li style="">Jungle Fortitude - 20% damage reduction. Pretty good for most of the game, not effective in Inferno unless you have good gear.</li><li style="">Spiritual Attunement - Bonus to mana, and 1% mana regeneration. Pretty good if you are having mana problems.</li><li style="">Gruesome Feast - Health gloves give you 10% mana, and 10% intellect. Stacks 5 times. Not very good when you get it, but can be extremely powerful in Inferno. The buff only lasts for 10 seconds, and health globes can be rare later on.</li><li style="">Bad Medicine - Mobs that take poison damage do 20% less damage for three seconds. much like Jungle Fortitude, but benefits people you are grouped with as well.</li><li style="">Blood Ritual - 15% of mana costs is paid in life. 1% health regen. Not as good as I thought it would be, but a solid alternative to Spiritual Attunement depending on preference.</li><li style="">Zombie Handler - Increases your zombie dog count from 3 to 4. Increases health of dogs and garg both by 20%. Obviously only good for as long as they aren't being one shotted. Although the increased number of dogs is useful for a build I will talk about below.</li><li style="">Pierce the Veil - Increases your damage by 20%, at the cost of 30% more mana. One of the only ways to increase damage, and quite limiting at that. I ignored it for the first half of the game. It becomes useful in Inferno, but at the cost of less skill diversity.</li><li style="">Fetish Sycophants - Small chance to summon fetish minions when using certain skills. Kind of a gag skill, not sure on whether or not it's ever really worth using.</li><li style="">Spirit Vessel - When you take a fatal blow, you enter a ghost state and recover 10% life. Cooldown is 2 minutes. Extremely useful, I never unequip it. You simply have too few other defensive options. Bugged at the moment, you still are prevented from dieing but are subject to enemy collision while in ghost state. So oftentimes you will still die due to being penned in by enemies. Fix plz.</li><li style="">Rush of Essence - Returns 30% of the mana cost of spirit spells like Haunt and Spirit Barrage. Even with this passive, those spells do not feel effective to me.</li><li style="">Vision Quest - When 4 spells are on cooldown, mana regeneration is increased by 300%. Only good for certain builds which revolve around it's use. Namely zombie bears, but can be used with zombie charger or firebats at lower levels.</li><li style="">Fierce Loyalty - Pets receive 100% of your thorns and regen from items. By this point of the game your pets are getting one shotted. Terrible passive.</li><li style="">Grave Injustice - When an enemy dies near you, you gain 1% life and mana, and your cooldowns are lowered by 1 second. I thought this would be amazing, but have gotten very little practical use out of it. The aoe is melee range, unless you have a lot of pickup range gear. Even with a set of gear with max pickup range as a test, I still did not seem to benefit unless the enemies were very near me.</li><li style="">Tribal Rites - Lowers the cooldown of Fetish Army, Hex, and Voodoo by 25%. Obviously only useful if you use these spells heavily.</li></ul><br />

</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
Now for difficulty builds.<br />
<br />
<b>Normal</b><br />
Like all classes, normal mode is basically &quot;experiment with the class mode&quot;. Try out whatever you want, but don't be too discouraged if you die more often than you do with other classes in normal mode. This is normal. The game is training you for later difficulties. Patience and/or masochism help. <br />
<br />
Note that if you wanted to be a pet class, this is the only mode to indulge that fantasy with.<br />
<br />
<b>Nightmare</b><br />
I went for a poison based build for Nightmare. I enjoyed this build the most, if my gear ever gets good enough I may return to it in Inferno. You basically poison everything on the screen and use Soul Harvest to keep yourself alive. <br />
<br />
Primary - Firebomb (darts are boring) - flash fire rune (attack jumps to extra targets)<br />
Secondary - Locust Swarm - pestilence rune (attack jumps to extra targets)<br />
1 - Ghost Walk - mana regen rune<br />
2 - Soul Harvest - health recovery per enemy rune <br />
3 - Acid Cloud - acid rain rune (larger aoe)<br />
4 - Bonus slot, pretty much changed it to whatever I felt like at the time. Gargantuan probably saw the most use.<br />
Passive 1 - Bad Medicine<br />
Passive 2 - bonus slot, changed to whatever I felt like at the time<br />
Passive 3 - Spirit Vessel<br />
<br />
<b>Hell</b><br />
Hell was when the game started getting tough, and I had to make harder decisions with my skills. Witch Doctors have a lot of life regen runes for skills, but few of them are really that good. Soul Harvest started seeing less use to me around this time because it's health return was no longer capable of keeping me alive. Voodoo healing worked great for people I was grouped with, but champion packs tended to chase people outside the area of effect.<br />
<br />
I experimented with many different things, including an early version of zombie bears, mass haunts, a wannabe kite build, etc, but my most used build was probably Exploding Dogs. There are two slight variations of this build.<br />
<br />
Primary - Darts - snake to the face - stuns single targets pretty effectively, and it's funny!<br />
Secondary - I actually don't remember, I changed it a lot. This may be the first time I started using Grasp of the Dead, probably the rune with health globes.<br />
1 - Ghost Walk - healing rune (it won't save your life, but it helps)<br />
2 - Sacrifice - this is where the two builds differ, if I was having trouble surviving I used the rune that caused zombie dogs to return health, and used this for healing. If I wanted to kill something quickly, I used the rune that caused dogs to have a 35% chance to spawn a replacement dog. You could then use this to quickly spam a lot of explosions in quick succession, depending on luck.<br />
3 - Summon Zombie Dogs - I tended to prefer the rune that had them drop health globes.<br />
4 - I don't remember what I used for this slot. Likely candidates = Horrify, Mass Confusion, Hex, Voodoo, Fetish Army, I also began experimenting with using the Wall of Zombies damage runes.<br />
Passive 1 - Zombie Handler, by bringing your total dogs up to 4, you increase the effectiveness of Sacrifice <br />
Passive 2 - still interchangeable, although at this point of the game, with this build, the health globe passive becomes useful for the first time<br />
Passive 3 - Spirit Vessel<br />
<br />
This a pretty simple build, but it did require you deciding when the best time to summon dogs are. Dogs have a long cooldown, and if you summon them too soon, they might die before you need to sacrifice them. If you wait and then summon them only when you need to sacrifice them, then you need to wait for the full cooldown before summoning again. Best case scenario in a hard fight with a refreshed cooldown and 4 zombie dogs, you will be able to detonate the first pack several times, then immediately summon a new pack and detonate them as well.<br />
<br />
<b>Inferno</b> <br />
<br />
Now that people are geared up, I am starting to see some experimentation (including a tanking build using Rain of Frogs with high life on hit), but generally there are two main builds for anyone starting out in Inferno: Zombie Bears, and Splinters. Note that even though these are the most popular builds, I'm only posting how I discovered them. I don't know what changes the community agreed was optimal.<br />
<br />
<b>Zombie Bears</b><br />
<br />
Also known (by me) as: lolparade, lolbears, bear parade. This build is most popular with Witch Doctors that wish they were any other class and cannot accept their fate. In all honesty I think this is a horrible build, but it's very popular, and it catches the eye of anyone watching. If you saw that infamous youtube video of the Witch Doctor killing the Butcher in 9 seconds, this is the build he was using. (nevermind the fact he was probably overgeared and could probably do the same with a good splinters build). People that don't know the class see your bears wreck havoc and just assume you are total faceroll whenever you use this build.<br />
<br />
The build revolves around the passive that gives 300% mana regeneration if 4 of your other abilities are on cooldown. This gets around two of the classes major problems: 1) mana is terrible, 2) your only burst skills require unrealistic amounts of mana to use. You can first make use of this build around level 40-45, but it doesn't become effective until level 60, when you unlock the Zombie Bears rune for Zombie Charger.<br />
<br />
Primary - Zombie Charger - Zombie bears - yes that's right, there is no room for a conventional attack in this build, as it's vital to have enough abilities to put on cooldown to activate the mana regen required to make Zombie Charger worth casting.<br />
Secondary - Any ability with a long cooldown - I tend to use Mass Confusion or Gargantuan for this slot<br />
1 - Ghost Walk - even with this build, Ghost Walk is vital. Use it to avoid getting hit during the first couple seconds of your parade, if you are lucky, things will die before it wears off<br />
2 - Soul Harvest - Increases your damage of the bear parades - Has a moderate cooldown<br />
3 - Any ability with a long cooldown - I tend to use Fetish Army for this slot<br />
4 - Voodoo - mana regen rune - This is vital. Bears are usable with 300% regen from passive, but do not melt faces without Voodoo backing them up. 2 minute cooldown.<br />
Passive 1 - Vision Quest (300% regen)<br />
Passive 2 - Pierce the Veil (extra damage)<br />
Passive 3 - Spirit Vessel (gives you a few extra seconds of bear time to kill something before you die)<br />
<br />
Basically the goal of the build is to put as many abilities on cooldown as possible, then when you want something to die, plop down Voodoo and just go to town. It's pretty hilarious to watch (hence my nicknames). It doesn't even matter what is on cooldown as long as it is, nothing else you do will hold a candle to the rampaging bears. Note that as mentioned above, you can experiment with variations of moderate success to this build as low as level 42 when you get the Zombie Charger rune that grants exploding demon dogs, or at level 45 when Firebats gets a rune that grants bats that seek out targets (really only good for bosses).<br />
<br />
So why is this build so terrible? Basically, it makes you useless for 1:30 out of every two minutes, just so that you can melt faces for 20-30 seconds. (or more realistically 5-10 seconds. Either it dies, or you do) If you don't kill the target before voodoo ends, your damage drops dramatically, even with 300% mana regen your primary attack will bleed you dry. You also need to be close to the target (at least with zombie bears), which is incredibly bad for you health on later difficulties. Addtionally, once you run out of mana, it's hard to start the chain back up again because you won't have enough mana to cast the spells with long cooldowns. Finally, the very fact you have to make sure you not capable of casting anything else makes the build extremely dull.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of possible ways to get around this deficiency: Some people drop Soul Harvest so they can use darts, but this makes it harder to keep abilities on cooldowns and lowers the damage of bears. Dropping Pierce the Veil will also lower your damage, but may reduce some of the mana problems when outside of voodoo. I might try it again now that I can take hits on Inferno.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Splinters</b><br />
<br />
This is the build I finally settled on while struggling with Inferno. It's very dependable, and you can do pretty well with it granted you are patient. It is called splinters due to the consensus early on that Darts with the splinters rune (the first rune you get), does the most consistently good damage and thus the best choice when min maxing for Inferno. I'm not actually sure how other splinter builds compare to mine, but this is what I have found to be effective. This may be true of most classes, but the vast majority of your spells will not serve you in Inferno until you trivialize content anyway. The only things that really work, are snares. So really this is a snare build, splinters just so happens to be your only real way of doing damage.<br />
<br />
Primary - Darts - splinters rune, does 60% damage three times, and has a very fast cast time. Even while rooted in place this is very helpful. Compared to fire darts (160% damage) and Soul Barrage (190% damage, but at high cost), it's the most practical, if boring, attack to use. As it's actually three projectiles, all 180% of the damage isn't necessarily wasted when the target dies. This is important when you have to kill large groups with no aoe.<br />
Secondary - Grasp of the Dead - unbreakable grasp rune, increases snare percentage to 80% - I experimented with different runes, but I found the extra snare to be most useful, does damage, but not much<br />
1 - Ghost Walk - it is no longer practical to use this ability for the sake of healing or mana regen, so I use the rune that increases it's duration to 3 seconds<br />
2 - Soul Harvest - I use the rune that increases the duration to 60 seconds, it means I have to waste less Ghost Walks in order to get a 5 stack intellect buff, which is important for your damage output. Ghost Walk is on a 15 second cooldown, and is too necessary for survival to waste every 30 seconds.<br />
3 - Wall of Zombies - some people like barricade (makes the wall longer), but I prefer unrelenting grip, it provides a second snare to use in tandem with Grasp of the Dead, note that this is the closest thing to an aoe you have, and can be used as such versus tightly packed trash<br />
4 - Voodoo - attack damage rune, because damage is vital and hard to come by in Inferno<br />
Passive 1 - interchangeable, if I think I get away with it I use the health globe passive, otherwise I use one of the two regen passives (Spiritual Attunement or Blood Ritual), now that my gear is better the damage reduction ones are a possibility again<br />
Passive 2 - Pierce the Veil - extra damage is hard to come by, and while you do need to be mindful of your mana, your primary attack will always be available<br />
Passive 3 - Spirit Vessel<br />
<br />
This is a very reliable, if someone boring, build. You aren't going to be as good a kiter as a Demon Hunter or a Wizard, so it's important to kill enemies before they get to you. Place a snare in front of a pack of enemies and starting blowing darts, when they get close to you, use Ghost Walk, run through them, and use Soul Harvest. Keep running, and once Ghost Walk ends, they will turn around to chase you again. Place another Grasp of the Dead and continue. Wall of Zombies (25 second cooldown) and Voodoo are more or less for emergencies or champion packs. In narrow areas Wall of Zombies will block all enemies from reaching you (assuming they don't teleport) for several seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well that's it. I hope that was helpful to someone. And if it wasn't, I hope it was a mildly entertaining read while bored at work. An insight into the mind of the least played Diablo 3 class. Roll one now, and be delighted when Blizzard later buffs it and fixes all the bugs!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've been taking a bunch of screenshots lately.  It's nice to have a MMO that utilizes somewhat state of the art graphical features. I thought I would start with some comparison shots for folks who were wondering what the effect tessellation has on environments. It is really fricken cool. Basically I meshed two shots together to provide a visual comparison. I was surprised how much it's used in the environment and how much of an impact it make. The brick especially looks really cool in London.<br />
<br />
I love the visuals in this game. <br />
