		<div>Just one of those articles you run across on the Internet where you think to yourself, by God he might have a point. By no means am I a Christian theologian or psychiatrist, so I can't really refute or support these points, but it should make for some interesting discussion. I suppose if you come from a standpoint that these &quot;prophets&quot; had the disease, and were at the same time extremely charismatic and able to develop a following, it might make sense.<br />

Here are a few points this guy makes that may or may not help explain the validity...<br />

				In present times psychiatrists and psychologists have reported millions of cases of people who claim identical things, consisting of two or more voices conversing with each other. However, nobody else has ever been able to hear the voices. Not the doctors, not the nurses, and not even the family members of the patient. That was exactly the situation for Jesus and Mohammed. Only they heard the voices and it was not because they were the chosen ones. It was simply because the others did not suffer from that neurological disequilibrium.

I'm assuming what he's saying here is there are documented cases of two schizophrenics hearing the same thing, which non-schizophrenics cannot pick up. Ghosts talking to them and such. Again, i can't verify his statement and he doesn't provide sources so that's up in the air.<br />

On this statement I can verify the latter based on my studies. Ninety nine point nine percent of the population of the Mediterranean region were pagans or believed in monotheistic Gods. We never hear of true atheists.<br />

				It is human nature to explain things simplistically and religions excel in simplifying things when trying to explicate any phenomenon. Due to the total absence of scientific information in the ancient times in which those two characters lived, it was inevitable that they and their contemporaries would interpret that situation as a divine calling.

				Withdrawal from reality and the experiencing of hallucinations are also typical symptoms, and both men were completely delusional. They thought they could walk over water, move mountains, feed the masses, and cure diseases. The truth of the matter is that the historians of the time did not report any of these events. Given the large scale following that these men had in Palestine and in the Arabian Peninsula respectively, it was inevitable that something as huge as the supply of food and medicine to a hungry and ill population would have been recorded in some way. However, nothing was reported.

				What was also reported was the continued misery and sickness of the population of both lands. There were no such miracles as the transformation of uneatable goods into food and wine. Life expectancy was of just eighteen years of age in Palestine and the Arabian Peninsula before the coming of Jesus and Mohammed, and during the time they realized their miracles, people continued to die by the droves at the same early age. Nothing improved while they spread their gospel. Not the food supply of the country, not the level of health, not the quality or the quantity of housing, and not even the level of crime or household violence. <br />
<br />
Once they died and rose to Heaven, where they supposedly took better care of their people for they could lobby more directly God, the miserable living conditions of those two territories remained as bad as before. Hundreds of years went by and the people of the region prayed uninterruptedly to the God that Jesus and Mohammed had peddled, but there was still no improvement.

This gives one pause. Although I'm not sure the point was they were on earth to save all humanity in a literal sense and went about doing it. I think it was more a display of God's power and the fact of his existence through the prophets, and it was up to individuals to seek salvation in the after-life based on the knowledge of God's existence. Maybe some of the mopre Bible-literate people out there can clarify this.<br />

				To understand the dangers that schizophrenia can cause when people who suffer from it attain positions of influence in a nation or in the world, it is worth pointing at what the latest research has revealed about the worst war of all times. <br />
<br />
The Second World War was the sole responsibility of Adolph Hitler and new studies show that the Austrian suffered from schizophrenia.

Anyways, I realize this wasn't the most well-written article, is bereft of sources, and the guy comes across as decidedly anti-big religion, but I think it's an interesting thought nonetheless. Were these great prophets plagued by mental illness and can anyone expound on that argument?</div>

		<div>As much as I hate religion and would like it to go away with theories like these, I think this theory can't explain everything away. Schizophrenic people are not like they are portrayed in movies or books. Most schizophrenics who have some form of hallucinations typically have the auditory variety. That would explain away the hearing of voices from god. However Jesus, Mohammed, and others also reported visual apparitions. Those are extremely rare in the case of schizophrenia due to the parts of the brain that are typically shown to be affected. In almost all cases, the temporal lobe and the thalamus are most affected by schizophrenia. To explain the visual hallucinations, something would have to be going on in the occipital lobe of everyone who reported seeing angels and such. That is just too unlikely. <br />
<br />
Now, I am not saying that visual hallucinations are not a symptom of schizophrenia because it has been said to accompany the disease in very rare cases, even olfactory hallucinations could theoretically occur. I am just saying that the likelihood of a mass spread of schizophrenia. <br />
<br />
Schizophrenia is a strange disease that isn't very well understood right now. Unfortunately, it is also used as a catch all in the psychology world for a broad range of symptoms. Hallucinations are just part of what are called the &quot;positive&quot; symptoms used to classify schizophrenia in the DSM manual. Positive symptoms are things that a person is almost thought to have extra that they shouldn't have. They include: hallucinations, delusions, catatonia, disorganized behavior, and strange speech. That doesn't even include the &quot;negative&quot; symptoms! Negative symptoms include: poor memory, slow speech, slow thinking, poor concentration, difficulty with expression. <br />
<br />
The thing about all the symptoms is that a schizophrenic person almost never just has positive symptoms without having some negative symptoms. Think about all those symptoms and tell me how many Jesus and Mohammed have been descibed as having. Then look at everyone else in the Bible and see which they display.<br />
<br />
In short, a very unlikely theory...</div>

I would suspect a fundamentalist on the other side of the argument would point out that Jesus was despised by the Pharasees and Sadducees, which would have been the groups who would have kept the historical records of anything he did.<br />

		<div>That person seems to have an agenda...anyway, from my own experiences of the odd n' very weird, while it's always possible I may be delusional (or <i>you</i>...are you real or just part of The Matrix? *evil grin*), the problem is, other folks experienced some of these strange events, at the same time, and some were not part of a group or knew what was occuring. Thus, you either have telepathy, or an actual unusual event.<br />
-Just because something is weird and outside the norms, does not mean therefore that whoever experiences it is automatically a nutcase, FFS! that's not Science, that's religious hysteria, like the bloody Inquisition: <i>&quot;If you're not supportive of us, you're obviously mad!&quot;</i> <br />
-Eat my shorts! :D<br />
<br />
The typical explanation for these things, currently, when their &quot;(the extreme skeptics) schizophernia&quot; posture breaks down, is that <i>&quot;it's all caused by magnetism!&quot;</i>...which is obviously bullsh*t because the magnetic fields required to induce hallucinations are, iirc, 10,000+ times stronger than that found anywhere on the Earth's surface, and would be sure as hell noticeable if they did occur. Since those have NEVER been seen, nothing like that at all, it's bullshit. <br />
-You can have hallucinations by brain injury, poison/drug, extreme magnetic field, and other trauma, that's perfectly fine and logical, however, when you can just label someone &quot;schizophrenic&quot; without an actual physical test to prove this is actually the case...that's <i>very </i>dangerous. Think about it a while.<br />
<br />
-Real problem is, that the folk behind this are nutbars themselves. Go check up on the amount/type criminality, insanity professional misconduct of the psychiatric profession, it's rather telling (and sad for the actual decent members of the profession)<br />
<br />
And yes, I do have a chip on my shoulder, two, actually: one being that, thanks to the hubristic asshattery of psychiatrists demanding that thier theory of &quot;M.E. = Psychosomatic Illness&quot; was the only possible explanation, the first two GPs who I saw to try and get help for my M.E., regarded it as &quot;hysterical, it doesn't exist!&quot;, when in fact it most certainly does, it's a neurological illness that some psychiatrist bastards decided to have as &quot;their pet illness&quot; and ignored all the damned evidence that it's physical in origin, leaving millions across the world to suffer and die...so, I hate them, bitterly so. Same vermin in decades past, called folk who had Type II diabetes or Multiple Sclerosis, &quot;Hysterically lazy&quot;. <br />
-If you require hard proof, in my case, MRI shows lesions on the brain and shadow on the pituitary gland, blood tests show gross failure in pituitary output that triggers testosterone, hence I have to get hormone therapy. So...those GPs, also an endocrinologist who couldn't be arsed to do his work because he had the same attitude (ME = mental case and lazy) and that section of th epsychiatric lobby at the root of this, were full of sh*t. I can supply you with a *lot* more evidence in that vein if you wish. In my opinion as a victim, those psychiatrist swine are criminals.<br />
<br />
Second point being, I've HAD &quot;supernatural&quot; experiences, and know more about it than some conceited w*nker who doesn't.  <br />
Those events occured many years <i>before </i>getting M.E. I can explain those events in detail if you wish. Oh, and having an MRI (which is a gigantic electromagnet) did NOT induce delusions in me, fyi....noisy as hell, but that's all :D<br />
<br />
I DO have psychologial issues, from gross abuse as child, and then later form the brain damage of this illness and the psychological effects of a painful, debilitating illness. In the case of the former, I learned to deal with and over come them to a large extent, you can't simply &quot;cure&quot; them though,  they are &quot;scars&quot; I'm sure many of the folk here have had similar woes,...but a lot of my family have what's reffered ot as &quot;the Second Sight&quot;, and I never did drugs or suffered fom depression, needed psychiatric help etc. I may have had a few screws loose, but I was not crackers, <i>biiiiiig </i>difference ;) I sought the help of a psychologist when the M.E. got os bad I was suicidal (it's a very, very bad illness, believe me), the psychologist was a very nice perosn, very helpful, but she could offer little professional help as I'd figured out for myself most of the coping stratgies, her kindness and Humanity though were very helpful. I'm not against good psychology or neurology, I just have a &quot;bee in me bonnet&quot; about arrogant swine who have forgotten their role' as physicians.<br />

Thus, while it is possible Jesus etc may have been delusional, the condescending, smary arrogant attitude from the article in OP, is probably a product of someone who's out ot bash religion, rather than prove a possible logical point.<br />
-Folk always need to remember much of what's written in the Bible, is crap, it never happened, or was badly interpreted and re-written over generations etc. People back then simply didn't understand as much as we do and thus couldn't comprehend or explain many things etc. While I do believe in the supernatural, this doens't mean that the events said ot have occured did, <i>or did not</i>. Very useful as spiritual, philosophical text, and a historical document, but it it s not a book of &quot;hard facts&quot;.<br />
-The Illiad is a fanastic story, partially fact, partially fiction, and alas, re-copied ove rthe centuries so how close it is ot the original text....? Thus, those who believe the Bible as LITERAL fact are as foolish as someone who says <i>The Illiad is all literal fact</i>.<br />
<br />
So, to say that &quot;<i>Jesus was delusional because he said he walked on water</i>!&quot; is in itself, either insane or spoken by someone who never bothered to actually study the hsitory of Jesus and the Bible at all: ie, a gum flapping twat :D</div>

mate, so what exaclty did <i>JESUS REALLY EVER SAY?</i><br />
Sorry for the emphasis, but this is the problem: we simply don't know what he said.<br />
It's pretty sure that he did exist, but what he did and said isentirely another matter. The veracity of that, as the New testament lays it out...is hardly evidence fit for a court, is it? :)</div>

you mean lies like Morals, Honor and Justice. Just grind the Universe down to its prime particles and point me one particle of those.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but lies are the filter that mankind needs to proceed with living. He just happened to tell lies that made those living conditions better bearable for everyone.<br />
<br />
Even if they were &quot;hearing voices&quot; in the wrong way, Both Jezus as Mohammed (at least in his first period) had a message that would have made life alot better for everyone, if followed the right way. In the case of Jezus, other people started to implement their powertrip on it. In the case of Mohammed, he was forced to revise his message after being confronted with humanity while being a leader.<br />
<br />
Regarding History reports: The RCC has spent centuries burning all records that were not conform their view. And they had the power and resources to do it. So this will probably include Historical records from the time period.</div>

Well, that's the story the bible presents.  I think that it's far more likely that they barely knew who the guy was, or found him annoying more thatn hated him.  There were a ton of heresies at the time, we've magnified the importance of Christianity during this time b/c it was succesful, while the others failed.  Say that one of the thousands of religious offshoots in America became popular a thousand years from now - would any of us have recognized its greatness now enough to care that much? Imagine that Scientology gets to write the history of itself in 3007 - how do we think that the attitude of Americans will be presented?<br />

You really only need to make a case that the prophets themselves had this rare form - everyone else can be explained by mass hysteria and/or the power of legend.  It's obviously impossible to verify this sort of thing, but it is within the realm of possibility.  The written information we have about them is shrouded in myth and poetry, it's not empirical data.<br />
<br />
However i have always though it interesting that so many people beleive that these prophets had communications with god, while one of the other schizophrenics i have known, who also says god talks to her, is locked up.</div>
