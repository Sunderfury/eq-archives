			Three days after releasing the new Ghostbusters game, development studio Fireforge Games filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Kotaku has learned. The company has been liquidating assets throughout July in an attempt to pay off a debt of at least $12 million, according to bankruptcy filings.<br />
<br />
Fireforge, not to be confused with a tabletop company with the same name, may only be known for the recent Ghostbusters game, which was received terribly when it was released alongside the movie on July 12. One possible explanation: The game was developed in just eight months, according to one person who worked on it. On July 15, the company filed for bankruptcy.<br />
<br />
The history of Fireforge goes back much further than one rushed licensed game. Founded in Irvine, California by ex-Blizzard employee Tim Campbell in 2011, Fireforge has started and stopped production on at least two MOBA-like projects over the past five years. One of those games, code-named Zeus, was due to be published by the hardware company Razer. The other game, code-named Atlas, was funded by the Chinese publisher Tencent, which also owns a 37% stake in Fireforge. <br />
<br />
Filings show that Fireforge owes around $11.3 million to Tencent. In addition, the now-bankrupt studio has been entangled in a lawsuit with a Singapore-based private company called Min Productions, owned by Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan.<br />
<br />
Tan alleges that Fireforge failed to deliver on their contract while developing Zeus, and instead used the money to work on Atlas with Tencent. Fireforge, on the other hand, says they only started working on Atlas once Razer had stopped paying them. The lawsuit is currently on hold as Fireforge sorts out their bankruptcy proceedings.<br />
<br />
On top of that, lawyer Richard Land—who was the “receiver” responsible for selling the games and IP of 38 Studios following that company’s closure—sued Fireforge in 2015. Land claims that Fireforge signed a deal to license 38 Studios’ proprietary social media platform Helios for $3.7 million, then reneged and instead hired several ex-38 Studios employees to build their own version.<br />
<br />
More to come as we continue to learn the full picture here. Fireforge CEO Tim Campbell did not return a request for comment.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This is it, the moment everyone's been waiting for: the month when the last video game anyone will ever play finally comes out.<br />
<br />
I am, of course, jokingly referring to <b>No Man's Sky</b>, the space exploration sand box that people have been hyping themselves up for. I sort of expect that it's going to end up disappointing people. How could it not with the insane expectations and hype people are attaching to it? Still, it should be a neat game and be well worth checking out. <br />
<br />
<b>Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</b> is also a pretty big game set to release this month. The last game was great, and with a bigger budget I expect the next one to be even better. I forgot to mention it in the E3 thread, but one of the things they are adding to this game (raising a few eyebrows) is some kind of hacker heist multiplayer mode. While it wasn't needed, it sounds like they are at least trying something unique, and impressions from the main game still sound good.<br />
<br />
Not much on handhelds. 3DS is getting <b>Metroid Prime: Federation Force</b>, the game that angered fans that wanted a new &quot;real&quot; Metroid game focusing on exploration. This instead seems to be a multiplayer shooter with an added sports mode to the mix. Will be interesting to see how it is received on launch. I think in this case the branding hurt the product more than it helped it.<br />
<br />
Rounding out the month is a ton of smaller stuff, some of it I don't even recognize. The standouts (for me) are <b>Abzu</b>, an deep sea exploration game, and the start of the new <b>TellTale Batman</b> series.<br />
<br />
<b>Madden</b> and <b>World of Warcraft: Legion</b> are also due this month. The audience for these games probably doesn't need to be reminded of this.<br />

<br />

		<hr />
		
			Over the holiday weekend, a whole load of dirt got thrown into the already murky waters of the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive gambling scene. Popular YouTubers Trevor ‘TmarTn’ Martin and Tom ‘ProSyndicate’ Cassell were revealed to be key staff of a skin gambling site they’ve promoted (sans overt disclosure of that fact) on multiple occasions.<br />
<br />
CSGO Lotto is a site where you can gamble real money in hopes of winning Counter-Strike weapon skins, the rarest of which are worth hundreds and even thousands of dollars in real world cash. If you pay a few dollars, you watch a roulette-style apparatus select who wins an item. Sites like CSGO Lotto stand to rake in a handsome sum off these transactions. A Bloomberg report from earlier this year pegged the Counter-Strike gambling scene’s value (in 2015 alone) at $2.3 billion. <br />
<br />
The controversy surrounding Martin, Cassell, and CSGO Lotto began when HonorTheCall posted a video in which they dug into major CSGO gambling site CSGO Lotto’s incorporation details and discovered some pretty stunning information: the site’s president is Trevor Martin, and its VP is Thomas Cassell. Despite this, Martin has posted videos like “HOW TO WIN $13,000 IN 5 MINUTES” about CSGO Lotto, while Cassell has done things like taking a $50 sum and using it to rack up hundreds of dollars on the site.<br />
<br />
In a lengthy video entitled “Deception, Lies, and CSGO,” h3h3Productions dug even deeper:<br />
<br />
<center>
<iframe class="restrain" title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_8fU2QG-lV0?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</center><br />
<br />
In short, h3h3 was unable to find any instances of Martin or Cassell disclosing affiliation with CSGO Lotto—let alone high level operation of it. Responding to this in a video that’s since been made private, Martin claimed that, “This is something that has never been a secret.” Cassell, meanwhile, claimed (via Twitter) that, “I’ve always disclosed that my CSGO videos were sponsored &amp; even asked a YouTube employee if anything more was needed &amp; they said it wasn’t.” He also apologized to anyone who felt they were misled. That’s some... interesting wording, especially coming from a guy who previously found himself in hot water after failing to disclose financial ties to Dead Realm, a multiplayer horror game he promoted on his YouTube channel.<br />
<br />
On top of that, in an earlier video about CSGO Lotto that’s since been made private (you can see it in h3h3's video above, however), Martin said things like, “We found this new site called CSGO Lotto, so I’ll link it down in the description if you guys want to check it out. We were betting on it today and I won a pot of like $69 or something like that, so it was a pretty small pot, but it was like the coolest feeling ever. I ended up following them [CSGO Lotto] on Twitter and stuff, and they hit me up and they’re talking to me about potentially doing like a skin sponsorship.” That is, as PC Gamer points out, a pretty strange way to talk about a site you helped found.<br />
<br />
Martin has also claimed that CSGO Lotto videos did include disclosures, but if you run videos like “HOW TO WIN $13,000&quot; through the ol’ Wayback Machine, it appears that a very slight disclosure—“video made possible by CSGO Lotto”—was added after the fact. Other videos, meanwhile, either lack the disclosure or have been made private. <br />
<br />
Martin has also claimed that he wasn’t in charge of CSGO Lotto when that first video was posted, that it was a “feeler” to see if partnering with the gambling site would be a worthwhile business venture. Again, however, the incorporation paperwork suggests otherwise.<br />
<br />
Promoting a site like this sans disclosure is, of course, illegal, per rules laid out by the Federal Trade Commission last year. It’s also tough to look at a situation like this without wondering if Martin and Cassell were being entirely honest about their earnings on CSGO Lotto. If they control it, after all, flubbing the numbers isn’t outside the realm of possibility. I should stress, however, that I am merely speculating on widely held sentiment. It has not been proven that Martin or Cassell did anything to that effect. That said, a YouTuber named PsiSyndicate (no relation to ProSyndicate) has since claimed that a different CSGO gambling site rigged their system so he could win big and post a video promoting his earnings. So, if you buy his account of events, it is a thing that can happen in CSGO’s bandit-friendly Wild West of a gambling scene. <br />
<br />
I reached out to both Martin and Cassell for comment. While the latter has yet to respond, the former said, “We are not making any statements at this point in time.” However, they are hoping to have something ready later today. <br />
<br />
Until then, this is decidedly not a good look for a reportedly multi-billion dollar scene that’s already facing scrutiny due to a pending lawsuit against Valve over the legality of facilitating what essentially amounts to unregulated gambling. Regulation, you’d hope, would stop something like Martin and Cassell’s shady dealings from occurring. Or at least, it’d discourage people from attempting to game the system.<br />
<br />
The bottom line: Valve needs to drop the hands-off approach and grab ahold of this thing asap. The Counter-Strike gambling scene might be helping funnel millions into Valve’s pockets, but they can no longer afford to stay silent about it.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>if you want the ultimate one shot glass cannon, well more than that but hey it's great fun/easy ;)<br />
make an Occultist<br />
take the DREEG'S EVIL EYE skill, you don't need ot increase it's power at start unless you wish to , instead push mastery points up so you can unlock FOCUSED EYE for Dreeg's Evil Eye<br />
turns the spammable acid/poison nuke/DoT, into a gigantic UBER nuke/DoT!<br />
can't spam it any more, 4 sec recast but ye gods it melts ANYTHING it hits :hulk:<br />
use it to waste bosses and groups of enemies<br />
<br />
work on collecting things that boost Acid/poison damage and power regen<br />
<br />
the Raven pet with 1st heal ability will help you and any other pets/players stay alive<br />
<br />
blood of dreg gives great group acid damage, health regen, acid retaliation<br />
<br />
hell hound pet helps keep you alive<br />
<br />
Sigil of Consumption gives a prolonged ground based zone that gives Life Stealing to anything you harm in it, can be upgraded to do damage itself as well<br />
<br />
Curse of Frailty slows movement and debuffs them, upgraded form also further degrades various resists so hitting an enemy with that THEN Dreeg's Evil Eye can 2 or 3 hit kill many bosses :p<br />
<br />
I'd suggest taking 2nd class in Arcanist<br />
Inner Focus increase power and magic damage for both classes<br />
Panetti's Replicating Missile as my basic nuke (I don't' use weapons except for their boosts to magical effects etc)<br />
Mirror of Eroctes as an &quot;invulnerability&quot; for when things go FUBAR<br />
<br />
my 2 cents :)</div>
