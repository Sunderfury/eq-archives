I think the fact that you get xp by rezzing, and everyone who participates in a kill gets xp/credit for the kill makes all the difference.<br />

I really want those last three classes too, but I haven't even been able to spare enough gold for the last two bag sizes, so it's going to be awhile. Pretty sure my alts are going to be what ends up funding buying more alts. :D</blockquote>

</div>Is it different story-parts with the Orders different from race to race?<br />
I'm right in the beginning of the Order of Whisper story now, and I enjoyed the part with the pirates, and the little mini-drinking-game. But I presumed the whole part of the personal story-line with the Orders would be the same no matter what race or profession you chose?<br />
<br />
So far the storyline for my Norn Warrior hasn't been terrible. Considering that it's an MMO I think it's been fairly decent actually, but then I am still only level 33.<br />
Again I must say that the game has impressed me - I finally got around to touring Lion's Arch some more and the whole design of it is great. It makes places like WoW's Booty Bay look fairly sad in comparison.<br />
<br />
My only real gripe so far, is that the dye system isn't working as well as I had hoped.<br />
I sold almost everything I've gotten my hands on to buy dyes, and so far I have yet to find a dye that can make an actual black. Even Black dye is incapable of dying my stuff black, it's still dark-brownish. Maybe I need to save up 5 gold for the Abyss colour, but I have the feeling that it's not going to make a difference either.</blockquote>
