Technically according to the guidelines this should result in a one week suspension, however I'm putting it down as a formal warning instead. This warning will go in 10 days, <b>however</b> should you use similar language again it will result in a one week suspension. <br />
<br />
The forum has made it very clear that using words such as faggot, nigger or other expressions is not to be tolerated at all, and I hope in the future you will follow the guidelines set down.

The word police have come here to tell you that your word means what they want to be offended by and does not mean what you think it does.  Their need to be offended has no bounds... they will make up new things to be offended by like Faygoat which they have also decided means faggot and I believe they are also offended by Greygroat and Mayboat.  They have decided that all those words mean faggot.  So if you wish to make up a word that basically means overly sensitive weak ass pussy behavior do not let them know you have made up a word or else they will choose to have it mean faggot and you will get banned.</blockquote>

As a general rule, I also don't give a fuck if I offend people, and as bigotted of me it is, I use &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;faggot&quot; as frequently as I use &quot;retarded&quot; and a bunch of other offensive words, but at least I recognize they make me sound like a bigot, and amazingly, I don't use those words in certain company. I don't spew &quot;fuckin' douchebag went around a gay'd up my shit&quot; at work, but I might say it outside work. Time and place and all that. Outside work, with my friends who aren't offended, I'm welcome to be as much of a racist, facist, bigotted, retard as I want to be. Here, I try to keep it clean because that's what we agreed to. Tyranny of the majority and all that.</blockquote>

</div> Yes Dmitry, you like to use the word 'faggot' and make fun of gay people, we all get it. Fortunately the majority of the board decided they didn't like your blatant homophobia, got sick of it and pretty much put an end to it.<br />
<br />
It's brought up again and again because you can't accept that. It doesn't mean you're right, it means you can't accept being wrong.</blockquote>

<br />
Certain words, as highlighted in the warning, are not allowed on these forums and fall under rule 4, banning explicit racism, homophobia, sexism etc. For a rule 4 issue the guidelines are that we should suspend for a week, but I decided to just used formal wanting this time around. For rule 4 issues we will *not* just PM someone and ask them to remove it - this is not a borderline civility issue but something the board had made expressly clear on numerous occasions will not be tolerated.</blockquote>
