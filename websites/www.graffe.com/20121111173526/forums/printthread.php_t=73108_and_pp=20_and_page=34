Today was the last day to put up 48 hour auctions without having to deal with unsold crap during MoP, so last night I finally got the Horde DK's mining and skinning from 1 to over 300. I checked the mailbox today - many, many, many sales. It would have been worse if I hadn't cheated and bought a bunch of ore so I could smelt my way from copper through to truesilver. I get the idea a lot of new Jewelcrafters don't have Mining - I was able to sell bars of precious metals (silver, gold, truesilver) for more than I paid for the ore, even when more ore was on the AH.</blockquote>

Going as tank means zero chance of dying, but stuff dies at a slower pace. Vengeance keeps falling off :(</blockquote>

</div>The glyph market tends to have some serious AH-types in it. There's a good chance you're being undercut within minutes of posting those auctions. Also, glyphs are an &quot;I'll only ever need one&quot; item, so they can sell slowly in the best of times. I'm working towards Artisan flying on my Horde DK by selling just about everything I gather (Skinning/Mining) at the stupidly high prices lower-end mats command.<br />
<br />
Nice wand! Now you need to replace those trinkets. Again, I'm in the same boat on the DK alt - you level so quickly that half of your stuff is from zones way beneath you. Here she is now - I think I just replaced her final DK newbie zone item with a quest reward before I logged off yesterday. <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/icecrown/Quatria/simple" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://us.battle.net/wow/en/characte...Quatria/simple</a><br />
<br />
I got lucky today. I have a workman in my place fixing a hole in the roof, so I can't go to sleep until he leaves (he showed up at 8 am). He said he'd be done around 2 pm, which would be perfect timing to get up, shower, eat dinner, and be sitting at keyboard ready to go at precisely midnight tonight. I've put all the mats on the alts, and moved them next to various profession trainers so I can hit the ground running. I think I'm about to consume more Cataclysm mats in one night than I have in months, maybe even in a year. By the time I'm done, the big glut of people fighting to kill enemies with the cannon should have moved on and I can level in relative quiet. By the time I catch up to people it should be late enough that the bulk of them will have gone to bed. It's all planned out!</blockquote>

</div>Are you having fun? Don't worry about it.<br />
Heck even I'm pondering a monk sometime in the next month.  After I get one character to 90, that is. :)<br />
<br />
Prep-wise, I've done exactly nil for the expansion, outside of &quot;catching up&quot; after my 18 month break.<br />
<br />
I know I'll be playing my mage first (actually probably duplicating my run-to-max-level in previous expansions, which is Mage, Paladin, Hunter, DK) and in &quot;bored of questing&quot; moments will be doing archaeology and pet battles.<br />
<br />
I figure I'll use Grunty, Dark Whelpling, and Disgusting Oozeling for my lineup, unless I like the stats/skills of the Mechanicals.</blockquote>
