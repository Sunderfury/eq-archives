And of course, there are always random 5 mans (normal, heroic, and Hour of Twilight, in ascending order of difficulty). When you hit 85 you'll probably be limited to only being able to do normal 5 mans (due to iLevel), but you should get gear from those (plus JP and honor pieces) quickly enough to unlock heroic 5 mans. From there, getting the iLevel needed for HoT 5 mans (and eventually LFR raids) comes quickly enough, especially with the 397 epic gear being purchasable through JP.</blockquote>

</div>Oi, I'll have you know that the Exalted Furbolg cat is strictly superior to FIVE, yes FIVE other types of cats in pet battles!<br />
<br />
The rogue ended up in a 45 minute queue last night, so kiss the armour type theory goodbye. I really hope they fix this queue nonsense prior to MoP release, since there seems to be some reputation grinds that are scenario-based and rep isn't account-wide.<br />

</div>I'm avoiding the &quot;turn in 100 dailies&quot; thing this time around, even though TB dailies would be rather convenient (can turn them all in at the base camp, portal back to home city right in the camp). I don't want to waste time earning the XP I'll end up getting anyways, and there's going to be enough to do that morning. However, I can see why others would do it. The two dailies I have banked for turn-in: Stormwind's +2 skill point Fishing and Cooking dailies. Skill points are skill points, and worth the time for me, plus they're located right in the place everyone needs to be for MoP release so there's not a lot of running around to hand them in.</blockquote>

	</div>
</div>Backster, don't buy the PvP gear at 80.  Honestly, you'll replace it instantly with the gear from the cata quests.  And unlike most of the other PvP gear sets you encountered when leveling, the pieces aren't cheap.  So you can't outfit yourself entirely for about 3k like you could at 70 (well potentially, it could have changed).<br />
<br />
Save that honor now till you hit 90.  The inital Mists quests will be doable in Cataclysm quest greens and blues.  If you hit the honor cap and want to buy something, then pick up one the mounts purchasable with pvp points.<br />
<br />
You will be able to do looking for raid, normal and heroic dungeons and scenarios with randoms.  Only thing that you have to bring a group for is Challenge dungeons and they aren't really meant as a way to gear up.<br />
I understand what you mean about not meeting people, I'm the same way.  I do play on a server where I have an RL friend but he is a heroic level raider, so if he's doing that then I have to find my own stuff to do.<br />
<br />
I'm on Horde so I'm pretty sure there's no way I can join you, but can the graffies on other servers who might play alliance invite you to random dungeons via a Battle.net tag or something once you hit level cap?</blockquote>

Oh, and Ghostcrawler needs to <a href="http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2934-Paladin-and-Priest-Challenge-Mode-Gear-Dev-Interviews-Blue-Posts-Blizzard-News" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">can his hurt feelings</a>: &quot;<i>Players expected Theramore to be a big event, rather than a preview of how the Scenario system works. It was a systems preview and not an event.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Erm... of course we're expecting a big event - every other expansion launch has had a big event before - a HUGE event, really, if you're talking Cataclysm.<br />
Which brings me back to: Pandaria launch is the most underwhelming expansion launch in the game's history: I just returned from a rather long hiatus - and all I'm greeted with, content-wise, is a lousy scenario.<br />
<br />
Sure, there's a colorful air balloon near the portals in Stormwind, and an airship hovering over the harbor.<br />
<br />
Lead-in, build-up quests ? <br />
I remember disguising myself as a twilight cultist and doing that quest chain, all while mysterious earthquakes were taking place.<br />
I remember the undead plague and the cross-faction communication as a ghoul. I remeber being envious that my current main couldn't get into Karazhan to kill the boss there.<br />
I remember killing hordes of demons pouring from the portal in the blasted lands (OK, that one was a little underwhelming, but that's five years ago).<br />
   <br />
Did I miss something ?</blockquote>

			The time is nearly upon us as the mists begin to part and a new age of discovery amidst turmoil begins! For those of you prepared to begin your adventures the moment Mists of Pandaria is launched in your region, weve put together some important details that should get your expedition underway.<br />
<br />
As soon as we activate the new expansion content on launch, players who already have a Mists of Pandaria license with the data installed will gain instant access. If youre in the game when the clock strikes midnight, you dont even have to logout!<br />
<br />
So, what happens at midnight for those of us with Mists ready to go?<br />
<br />
    A yellow System Message will appear in your Chat Log telling you to visit Orgrimmar or Stormwind to start your travels.<br />
    <b>Level-85 characters will receive a new quest, no matter where they are in the world, which will guide them to Varian or Garrosh for further orders. If youre online at midnight you will receive the quest even if your Quest Log is full -- or you can visit Varian or Garrosh to get started on your journey to Pandaria.</b><br />
    Level-85 players will notice their experience bars automatically change so that experience can once again be earned.<br />
    Players who are at the Character Creation screen at midnight will notice the button to create a pandaren character will be enabled. (Reminder: This also applies to players who dont have a Mists of Pandaria license, as all races are now included with a base copy of World of Warcraft.)<br />
    Players who are at the Character Creation screen at midnight will notice the button to create a monk character will be enabled.<br />
<br />
Weve been very hard at work on this new technology with the goal of ensuring that players can enjoy a more stable and seamless transition into the next expansion than ever before. Our staff will be monitoring realm stability and gameplay issues around the clock, as we want to provide you with the best experience possible.<br />
<br />
Well see you on Pandaria!<br />
<br />
So, can i log out at 11:55pm (PDT of course) and sit at the character creation screen for 5 minutes for the Monk icon to &quot;light up&quot; and gets to creating right at 12:00? or will I need to log completely first?<br />
Yes, if you sit at the login screen the buttons will become enabled in real time. You shouldn't need to logout of your account.<br />
<br />
<b>What about us with 25 dailies? Did you guys test that yet haha<br />
Yes. You'll have somewhat of a &quot;soft cap&quot; on quests. So if you're Quest Log is full at midnight, visiting Varian or Garrosh will still allow you to embark on the quest to Pandaria (though, before you do I'd suggested turning in all those dailies).<br />
<br />
In other words, you won't miss receiving the quest if you have 25.</b>

<br />
I'm still only going in with 24 dailies ready - there was a bit too many &quot;new technology&quot; and &quot;close monitoring&quot; in those sentences.<br />
We have a guild group set up for launch night, and I am tanking. I don't think they will appreciate the tank being stuck away from Mist due to a slight quest log error :grinno:</blockquote>
