Sorry I can't be more helpful - We don't do Macs here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gore</div><div class="date">August 13th, 2003, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You of course could run your own DNS server...<br />
<br />
But if you only need a few entries on a few machines, you can use the Netinfo Manager (under &quot;Applications/Utilities&quot;) to edit the database (think of this as something like the Windows registry, only not nearly as monolithic).  Just click on the &quot;machines&quot; entry in the root folder... you should see only &quot;localhost&quot; and &quot;broadcasthost&quot; there if you've not tampered with this before.<br />
<br />
You can add the required hosts in here, if you'd like.  OS X doesn't use flat files for things such as this by default (as BSD does), so if you're rolling out a lot of hosts on a lot of computers you'll need to find a more elegant solution (such as using shell scripts and the netinfo command line tools, but I'm not overly familiar with those yet).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing like getting a webpage looking perfect on IE 6.0, NS 4.5+/Opera .. only to have it look totatly borked on IE on the Mac.<br />
<br />
I make an executvie desicion to ignore macs now and then :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gore</div><div class="date">August 13th, 2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy solution - DO NOT USE IE ON THE MAC, heh.<br />
<br />
Use Mozilla/NS or Safari, both of which are pretty good.  IE for Mac is now discontinued, and should go away forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jonas</div><div class="date">August 13th, 2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like option #3. Take a sledge hammer to all the PCs in your office, MS/Apple, doesn't matter. Afterwards, shoot yourself.<br />
<br />
This is what I plan on doing one of these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, one problem --- One of our major biggest clients happens to use a mac to take a look at the webpages/etc we do for them.<br />
<br />
So, even though 98% of the people use IE ... gotta make the client happy<br />
<br />
so in the end, its a good thing we have a mac here so we can preview pages on it before sending it out<br />
<br />
but regradelss<br />
<br />
.. macs do = evil</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gore</div><div class="date">August 13th, 2003, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, even though 98% of the people use IEMan, I must be using a different internet than you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mirdorr</div><div class="date">August 13th, 2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About 94% of page accesses are done using IE 5 or IE 6, so he's not far off.</div></div><hr />
