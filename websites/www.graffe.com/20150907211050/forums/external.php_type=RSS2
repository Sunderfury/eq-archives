			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Narcos just hit Netflix this past week, August 28th. <br />
<br />
I clicked in before I went to bed on Monday evening. I watched the first episode and thought it was superbly well done. Out of the 10 episodes, now, I've watched 3 and a half. It is more than likely a &quot;True Detective&quot; style of mini-series, where each season will likely focus on a different drug lord, and appropriately, they went with the one most Americans would name first.  <br />
<br />
Pablo Escobar, the infamous Colombian drug lord is the center of this season. From the very beginning, he is the person whose (real-person) face is seen in the opening credits. The entire narration of the series is done by the primary DEA agent from the United States who got himself involved from the very cornerstones in Miami and started to work his way up to the man himself. <br />
<br />
The story, though narrated by the DEA agent, focuses far less on his personal story, and the rungs in the ladders he had to climb in order to get there, and instead focuses on the story in a manner similar to &quot;The First 48 hours&quot; or &quot;Real ER Stories&quot; that are popular in reality television. The DEA agent narrator, instead, details all the information about Pablo Escobar that you already knew, and plenty you didn't. INcluding his affiliation with Radical Guerilla group, M-19 (and its small amount of history) that you definitely never heard about in the mainstream media. <br />
<br />
The actor who portrays Pablo Escobar looks less like the every-man that Pablo Escobar actually was, and, strangely, looks much more like the Adrian Grenier/Vinny Chase portrayal from Entourage that made up so much of the 4th season of that show. It isn't a distraction, but for those who are familliar with it, will probably grow a little more comfortable with the Pablo Escobar featured in NARCOS because of it - He is portrayed in far more shades of grey than any other previous portrayal, and it does it very, very well. <br />
<br />
I love Colombia. Bogota is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and at its altitude of nearly 10,000 feet, it has a skyline that is breathtaking, and they did not fall short on its beauty, because they shot nearly every scene of it in actual streets, on actual street corners, in actual buildings where the story transpires in its real history. This is a beautiful colonial world that never gets its story told in modern media the way that it should, and this series <b>does not fail.</b><br />
<br />
By focusing on Bogota, and less of the trafficking that occurred in and around Medellin, the story really makes the shades of grey limitless in its story of how unaffected some regions in Colombia were by the drug corruption that flowed in there from South America (at least in the beginning). <br />
<br />
This is a fantastic work of modern film, and I <i>really</i> hope, that in addition to staying as great as it does in the first 4 episodes, continues on for more than just it as a series, and perhaps brings American Television to learn more about Central and South American history. It touches lightly on several small figureheads of Colombian and South American History, but nowhere in the necessity of the broad strokes that exist in its complete history against the towers that US citizens feel that  their history dwarfs all others on the two continents. <br />
<br />
The supporting actor in the series who plays sort of a sleazy sidekick is done by the same actor who played Oberyn Martell in the Game of Thrones series. No head crushing in this one .... yet.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I started watching this a few days ago and I am pleasantly surprised by how good it is. They really do keep to the feel of the original movies, complete with the Noah character who acts as the know it all voice of the audience to exclaim how silly some of the stuff is. For the most part, they handle the situations very realistically, with the notable exception of the lack of media coverage later on in the run. Seriously, half a dozen high school kids are murdered in around 3-4 weeks and no major media comes around to cover it?<br />
<br />
Anyway, if you want to see a slasher flick (well, more of a mystery really) that is pretty well done check it out.</div>

		<hr />
		
			On Wednesday, a part-time officer in Millis, Mass., said that a man in a pickup truck had shot at his cruiser. They exchanged fire. The cruiser crashed and caught on fire. Police from several towns, a Massachusetts State Police helicopter and K9 units were all part of the massive hunt for the suspect.<br />
<br />
But it turns out there is no suspect, Millis Police said Thursday. The part-time officer allegedly made the whole story up.<br />
<br />
After several interviews with the part-time officer, “and as a result of all other evidence, we have determined that the officer’s story was fabricated, specifically that he fired shots at his own cruiser as part of a plan to concoct a story that he was fired upon,” reads a Millis Police Department statement. “The evidence indicates that the shots were not fired by a suspect and there is no gunman at-large in or around the town.”<br />
<br />
The department isn’t releasing the officer’s name and said it wouldn’t comment on possible motives or his performance record, pending formal charges. But they did announce he will be fired and that they would work with prosecutors and state police to “determine what criminal charges the officer will face.”<br />
<br />
When the incident first became public, authorities said they were looking for a man between 25 and 40 years of age in a dark-colored pickup truck who fired two or three shots at the officer who returned fire. State police had said that the cruiser crashed into a tree and caught fire, and the officer inside wasn’t seriously hurt.<br />
<br />
After the incident, residents in the suburban Boston town were told to stay inside as SWAT officers searched for a suspect, the Associated Press reported.<br />
<br />
Investigators searched for ballistics evidence around the scene, but the only such evidence they found belonged to the part-time officer, according to police. And investigators aren’t sure if he set the cruiser on fire, AP reported.<br />
<br />
State Police referred questions to the Millis Police Department. A spokesman for the local department wasn’t available for comment.<br />
<br />
The part-time officer used to be a dispatcher at the Millis department and was hired as a “permanent intermittent officer” in June. “He was scheduled to begin training to become a full-time officer soon,” the Millis Police statement read.<br />
<br />
Other officers on the force are “dedicated public servants and committed to the highest levels of integrity,” the statement read. It continued:<br />
<br />
“The alleged actions of this officer should NOT reflect on the remainder of the Millis Police Department… To their credit, they undertook the difficult task of investigating one of their own and did so without bias.”

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hey-hey! That time of year again! It's amazing how fast the summer goes when the Cubs are winning and you are staring at a 4-8 season for the Iowa Hawkeyes! /puke If a 16% decline in season ticket sales doesn't convince them that it's time for Kirk Ferentz to hang up the headphones maybe playing a home night game in November in front of 30k Minnesota fans because Iowa fans are so fed up with the team will convince them.<br />
<br />
As you can see, I don't have a whole lot of faith in Iowa this fall, but then if you had the misfortune of watching that abortion of a football game they played in last January, you'd be on the same page as me.<br />
<br />
I mean, he threw the kickoff forward!<br />

<br />
<br />
Anyway, time for the teams who actually have a chance to be relevant by October. As for the Big 10, Well you have to go with Ohio State again. They are so far ahead of the rest of the league in talent, coaching, and organization anymore it's just not even fair. They are the Barcelona of college football right now. Alabama was that a few years ago but now we are seeing the beginning of Ohio State's run as the &quot;dynasty&quot;, as much as you get them in college football. I really don't see anyone threatening Ohio State this year. Michigan State can at least play on the same field with them and will surely be in contention for what used to be a BCS bowl. Michigan, while they will be remarkably better, is probably still a couple years away. It takes time to turn programs around. Urban Meyer picked up a team that was already among the best teams in the country so it was easier for him to get them to the next level. The rest of the Big 10, Wisconsin will be good, but not as good as they have been. Minnesota looks like they are reaching the top of an upswing and, why not, I'll pick them to win the <STRIKE>Big 12 North</STRIKE> Big 10 West for the honor of getting slaughtered in the Big 10 championship game by 70 points. Putting all of the marquee teams and all of the recruiting into one division might make sense geographically, but it is destroying the quality of teams in the West. Not sure how long Delaney will keep that up, but then if the money keeps rolling in will anyone notice?<br />
<br />
So, Ohio State, and for my other three I'll go with Alabama, Oregon again, and Baylor getting the invite this year. It will be a controversial decision over Michigan State but since MSU will have lost a close game to Ohio State that will give the one loss Baylor team the nod to face Ohio State in the first round of the playoffs. I'll go with Ohio State and Alabama with Ohio State winning the slugfest for the national championship again.<br />
<br />
Good luck to all this season, me? I'll be watching the Cubs in October and then anxiously await to see who the Blackhawks trade Patrick Kane to for hockey season.</div>

I'm looking for an app, preferably Android, that will let me track my progress and that's easy to update on my phone while I am working out.  I've seen a bunch of apps out there, but a lot of them don't allow me to enter my own workout, or don't have the machines I use, etc.  I want something that's customizable, so I can enter my own workout plan and track how many minutes cardio I do, # of calories burned, reps/weight, etc.  Just general tracking so I can gauge progress over a period of time.<br />

I've been keeping track in a Google spreadsheet, but that's kind of klutzy.<br />

Does anyone have an app they use that they'd recommend looking at?</div>

			Trains carrying hundreds of migrants have started arriving in Vienna after Austrian authorities appeared to give up trying to apply European Union rules by filtering out refugees who had already claimed asylum in Hungary.<br />
<br />
In the latest twist in a humanitarian and political crisis that is now testing the survival of both Europe's open-border regime and its asylum rules, Hungary allowed the migrants, many of them fleeing Syria's civil war, to cram into at least four trains leaving Budapest for Austria or Germany.<br />
<br />
Many of the refugees arriving at Vienna railway station on Monday evening immediately raced to board trains heading on to Germany, as police looked on, preferring not to intervene, witnesses said.<br />
<br />
A train also arrived in Munich from Budapest on Monday evening — German police said there were about 200 onboard.<br />
<br />
In line with EU rules, an Austrian police spokesman said only those who had not already requested asylum in Hungary would be allowed through, but the sheer pressure of numbers finally prevailed.<br />
<br />
The migrants' plight highlights the huge challenge facing the European Union, which has eliminated border controls between 26 states of the &quot;Schengen area&quot; but requires new asylum seekers to apply in the first country they enter — in this case Hungary.<br />
<br />
Most of the migrants have no intention to stay in Hungary, even those who register there, but aim to reach richer western European countries.<br />
<br />
The Vienna police spokesman said migrants allowed into Austria could stay for two weeks while they decide whether to seek asylum there. <br />
<br />
Those who did not would be returned to their last transit country.<br />
<br />
Austrian authorities have stopped hundreds of refugees and arrested five traffickers as part of a clampdown along a main motorway from Hungary against the criminal gangs exploiting the human misery following last week's gruesome discovery of 71 dead migrants in an abandoned truck near the Hungarian border.<br />
<br />
<b>Schengen free movement principle under threat</b><br />
<br />
A senior official at Austria's interior ministry, Konrad Kogler, denied on Monday that the clampdown, which includes increased checks on the eastern borders, amounted to a violation of the Schengen accord on free movement.<br />
<br />
&quot;These are not border controls,&quot; Mr Kogler said, noting that checks were taking place across Austria's territory as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is about ensuring that people are safe, that they are not dying, on the one hand, and about traffic security, on the other.&quot;<br />
<br />
German chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country expects to receive some 800,000 migrants this year, the most of any EU country, said the migrant crisis could destroy the principle of free movement in Europe enshrined in the Schengen accord.<br />
<br />
&quot;If we don't succeed in fairly distributing refugees then of course the Schengen question will be on the agenda for many,&quot; she said at a news conference in Berlin.<br />
<br />
&quot;We stand before a huge national challenge. That will be a central challenge not only for days or months but for a long period of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Over the past three days, Hungarian police said they had caught 8,792 migrants crossing into the country, most of them from Serbia.<br />
<br />
Hungary plans to tighten laws on migration this week and also plans to set up holding camps near the Serbian border. <br />
<br />
The government said it may use the army to help police protect the borders if it gets the necessary parliamentary approval.<br />
<br />
The changes will also impose stronger penalties for the illegal crossing of borders and for damaging a 175 kilometre fence being built at the Serbian border, and would enable Hungary to expel migrants violating the new rules.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The floodgates have opened, and a torrent of high profile new releases are beginning to be released. Bear with me while I attempt to highlight the many standouts, but remember that there may be many more things I don't cover.<br />
<br />
I believe the biggest game this month is going to be <b>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</b>. Konami as a company has been going through some really weird corporate drama, and is more or less giving up on traditional games altogether. As a result, the creator of this series has left the company, and for all intents and purposes that makes this the last one. Though even people who do not care about the story or history of these games may be interested in this one, as the gameplay itself has finally evidently advanced to the point where it stands up to modern western releases.<br />
<br />
Other big AAA releases this month include <b>Mad Max</b> and <b>Destiny: The Taken King</b>. Both of these are somewhat murky prospects that will probably please a select group of fans, but not necessarily the industry at large. I've only heard scattering mixed reports on Mad Max, but anyone who wants an open world game and doesn't want to play MGS5 might want to keep an eye on it. Other big multiplatform releases include <b>Lego Dimensions</b>, a new <b>Skylanders </b>game, and a new <b>Tony Hawk</b> skater game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of the three platform holders, Nintendo arguably has the most significant new release in <b>Super Mario Maker</b>. What seemed at first to just be a simple downloadable game has gradually grown into a product with a lot of pull behind it. I've seen people theorize that if it had come out when the Wii U launched, the system might not be in such a tepid state. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Xbox One gets a new entry in their <b>Forza</b> franchise, and the PS4 gets a new version of the underappreciated <b>Tearaway</b>. Sony platforms also share a new game in the <b>Nobunaga's Ambition</b> series with the PC. I don't know much about them, other than they are hardcore strategy games with a cult following. They seem very reminiscent of stuff like Crusader Kings and Total War. Another shared PS4 and PC release is <b>Armello</b>, a kind of card game strategy hybrid with some pretty vivid art.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most of the new handheld games this month are actually spinoffs from other series. The 3DS is getting <b>Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer</b> (seems self explantory), and the Vita is getting <b> Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls</b> and <b>Persona 4: Dancing All Night</b>. Dancing All Night is a rhythm game created to celebrate the music in the various Persona games, and features remixes from (famous?) Japanese musicians, composers, and DJs. I'm not sure what exactly Ultra Despair Girls is, but this is one of those cases where no one who played the original games will want to play it, but everyone who did will.<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally, PC. As always, PC shares a lot of releases with consoles, so I'm only going to highlight a couple of the exclusives (that I know about). <br />
<br />
First, <b>Sword Coast Legends</b> is launching this month. From what I've seen, this is going to be another take on simulating the dungeon master experience in an online setting. You've got your classic isometric crpg experience, can be played co-op with friends, with one person acting as a DM and guiding the other players on an adventure. Now, I have not seen anyone talking about this at all, but as soon as I saw it on Steam I knew it was something to at least keep an eye on. Fake edit: Apparently this is also coming out on consoles, but I'll leave it here.<br />
<br />
The fate of the earlier Fallout games has seemed to be in a state of flux (also known as lawyer hell), but Bethesda apparently finally got the rights to release them all in one package. As far as I can tell, this is a retail only collector's edition style release. <b>Might and Magic Heroes VII</b> is also due this month, though I haven't heard anyone talking about it, so don't know any details.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I mentioned a few months ago that Mighty No 9 (The Megaman game) has a publisher now, which means a solid release date that won't get pushed back again. Well, it got pushed back again. Apparently it didn't play well and they decided to try and make it fun. It's been a pretty rocky road for this game, I wonder how it will turn out.<br />
<br />

This year, the overall  leader, two other riders, and two teams were expelled or withdrew from  the race as a result of failing, or missing, drug tests. The eventual  winner, Alberto Contador, is himself alleged to have had a positive test  result last year. So many leading cyclists have tested positive for  drugs, or have admitted, from the safety of retirement, that they used  them, that one can plausibly doubt that it is possible to be competitive  in this event otherwise. <br />
<br />
<br />
In  the United States, the debate has been fueled by the baseball player  Barry Bonds’ march towards the all-time record for home runs in a  career. Bonds is widely believed to have been helped by drugs and  synthetic hormones. He is frequently booed and mocked by fans, and many  thought that baseball’s commissioner, Bud Selig, should not attend games  at which Bonds might tie or break the record. <br />
<br />
<br />
At  the elite level, the difference between being a champion and an  also-ran is so miniscule, and yet matters so much, that athletes are  pressured to do whatever they can to gain the slightest edge over their  competitors. It is reasonable to suspect that gold medals now go not to  those who are drug-free, but to those who most successfully refine their  drug use for maximum enhancement without detection.<br />
 <br />
<br />
As  events like the Tour de France turn farcical, bioethics professor  Julian Savulescu has offered a radical solution. Savulescu, who directs  the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at Oxford University and holds  degrees in both medicine and bioethics, says that we should drop the ban  on performance-enhancing drugs, and allow athletes to take whatever  they want, as long as it is safe for them to do so. <br />
<br />
<br />
Savulescu  proposes that instead of trying to detect whether an athlete has taken  drugs, we should focus on measurable indications of whether an athlete  is risking his or her health. So, if an athlete has a dangerously high  level of red blood cells as a result of taking erythropoietin (EPO), he  or she should not be allowed to compete. The issue is the red blood cell  count, not the means used to elevate it. <br />
<br />
<br />
To  those who say that this will give drug users an unfair advantage,  Savulescu replies that now, without drugs, those with the best genes  have an unfair advantage. They must still train, of course, but if their  genes produce more EPO than ours, they are going to beat us in the Tour  de France, no matter how hard we train. Unless, that is, we take EPO to  make up for our genetic deficiency. Setting a maximum level of red  blood cells actually levels the playing field by reducing the impact of  the genetic lottery. Effort then becomes more important than having the  right genes. <br />
<br />
Some argue  that taking drugs is “against the spirit of sport.” But it is difficult  to defend the current line between what athletes can and cannot do in  order to enhance their performance. <br />
<br />
<br />
In  the Tour de France, cyclists can even use overnight intravenous  nutrition and hydration to restore their bodies. Training at high  altitude is permitted, though it gives those athletes who can do it an  edge over competitors who must train at sea level. The World Anti-Doping  Code no longer prohibits caffeine. In any case, performance-enhancement  is, Savulescu says, the very spirit of sport. We should allow athletes  to pursue it by any safe means. <br />
<br />
<br />
Moreover,  I would argue that sport has no single “spirit.” People play sports to  socialize, for exercise, to keep fit, to earn money, to become famous,  to prevent boredom, to find love, and for the sheer fun of it. They may  strive to improve their performance, but often they do so for its own  sake, for the sense of achievement. <br />
<br />
<br />
Popular  participation in sport should be encouraged. Physical exercise makes  people not only healthier, but also happier. To take drugs will usually  be self-defeating. I swim for exercise, and I time myself over a set  distance to give myself a goal and encourage myself to work harder. I am  pleased when I swim fast, but I would get no sense of achievement from  improving my time if the improvement came out of a bottle. <br />
<br />
But  elite sport, watched by millions but participated in by few, is  different. For the sake of fame and glory now, athletes will be tempted  to risk their long-term health. So, while Savulescu’s bold suggestion  may reduce drug use, it will not end it. <br />
<br />
<br />
The  problem is not with the athletes, but with us. We cheer them on. We  acclaim them when they win. And no matter how blatant the drug use may  be, we don’t stop watching the Tour de France. Maybe we should just turn  off the television and get on our own bikes. <br />
<br />

</div>Singer's argument on the topic is much more cogent than others I have read and not essentially an appeal to emotion or tradition depending on context leading to absurdities such as MLB not enabling a consistent strike zone now that technology is available to do so or in the past not utilizing goal line technology in soccer.<br />
<br />
For myself I watch sports to see humanity at their peak and perform against one another competitively do so, to that end I *want* people to take advantage of any means available to them to improve. Counter arguments ignore points that Singer makes with respect to training differences dependant on resources available to them, which are significant advantages in the context of extremely marginal differences between participants. <br />
<br />
That is why I was extremely annoyed when it was announced that they would start drug testing in esports. I immediately lost any interest in professional gaming that is drug tested. I want to see people as excellent as humans can be, in the future this would mean taking advantage of cybernetics as well. I especially like humans vs. computers in competitions.</div>

I can understand not always giving 5% off but it would be tremendously useful to me to be able to add all the supplements I buy from them and other periodic items to that plan so that I do not have to remember manually. But, this is something Amazon does not let me do. I would probably even pay more for them to track this, something they can do trivially in software but don't let me do. It's maddening.</div>
