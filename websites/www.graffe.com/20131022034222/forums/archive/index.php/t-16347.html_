Cat Schwartz is one of the cute girls on TechTV. I know everybody jerks it to Morgan Webb, but Cat has that nerdy emo girl cuteness that I and many others find hard to resist. Cat has a blog (http://catschwartz.com/) on which she does bloggy things like posting pics of herself, writing crappy poems, and keeping her fans abreast of her schedule. <br />
<br />
Now for the fun part! Photoshop generates small preview images for the pics it produces and hides them in the original image. If you change the image drastically, the preview thumbnail is changed too. But if you don't make a major change, and instead just crop the picture and resave it under the original file name, the preview thumbnail stays the sameand reflects not what your image currently lloks like but instead what the original looked like. So if you (or Cat, in this case) took some topless photos and then cropped your boobies out, unless you changed the filename the original topless pics would remain as the thumbnail. The ones above don't work because I resized them to save space and bandwidth, but the pics below give you an idea of what I'm talking about. <br />

Google search and you'll find the pics.<br />

Man, I must have jacked off to these pics at least 20 times already to the best orgasms ever. <br />
It's two pics dude. Two pics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaDisguiseKa</div><div class="date">April 8th, 2004, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">She thought it would be neat to post nude pictures on her website with her tits cropped. Due to a photoshop flaw, people were able to remove the crop and see the original pics. Those comments had me rolling too Apallo. Lot's of scary fanbois on there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apallohadas</div><div class="date">April 8th, 2004, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know that it's so much a flaw, as her not knowing how to crop properly. Cut &amp; Paste cropping prevents that little err of her's!<br />
<br />
I'm starting to think she did it on purpose so her fan base would blow up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nadiar</div><div class="date">April 8th, 2004, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not a phoeoshop flaw, its a flaw with the camera she uses, which takes a picture, and embeds a thumbnail into the picture.you could paint the entire picture white, and the thumbnail would remain the same unless you use a program to remove the thumbnail.</div></div><hr />
