There is a lot of misinformation about Bear Tanks, not just in the general population and the official boards, but everywhere. If you are interested in the math behind some of these claims, visit <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-druid&amp;t=781672&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post781672" target="_blank">http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/th...p=1#post781672</a>.<br />
<br />
When discussing this topic, we should first ask the big question: <i>&quot;What is a Druid?&quot;</i> The answer is (generally!) pretty simple: <i>&quot;Whatever you need them to be.&quot;</i> We all know how strong a Druid can be as a healer, so this post is going to discuss their strengths and weaknesses as a tank.<br />
<br />
Advantages:<br />
<br />
:D All druids gain a fixed percentage bonus to armor in Bearform and Dire Bearform. In Dire Bear, it is +360% of armor value -- note that this doesn't apply to buffs, effects, agility bonus, etc. Just the value of the armor on the item -- which when added means that, untalented, a bearform druid will gain 4.6x from high armor. With the Thick Hide talent at 5/5, this jumps up to around 5x. This is what allows for the insanely <b>high mitigation</b> of Bear tanks.<br />
<br />
It bears mentioning (haha!) that though there are diminishing returns on Armor as it applies to Mitigation, there are <i>no diminishing returns on Armor as it applies to Time-To-Live</i>. 1000 armor will increase your effective lifetime vs. a mob by a constant amount up to the cap at 75% mitigation. Why is this? Because mitigation isn't a constant! Jumping from 70 to 75% requires a ton of armor, but that 5% is worth a lot more than the jump from 50 to 55%.<br />
<br />
:D Bearform grants a bonus to HP. There is a Feral Talent which applies in addition to this: Heart of the Wild 5/5 grants an extra 20% stamina in Bearform (kind of like Blessing of Kings, for Sta only.) Bear tanks, properly geared, have <b>a ton of HP</b>.<br />
<br />
:D Bearform grants the same aggro modifier as Defensive Stance: 130% of standard aggro. Feral talents can increase this to 145%, the same as a talented prot warrior. However, Bear aggro works a bit different: It is almost totally dependant on damage. Maul is our tool of choice (mechanics similar to Heroic Strike), and it gets an additional aggro modifier above and beyond the stance modifier. Recent studies have estimated the additional modifier at 1.75. So maul aggro = Damage*1.75*1.45 (Talented), which works out to Damage*2.54. A crit maul is a fearsome, <b>fearsome amount of aggro</b>. There is a rumor that Maul crits receive an additional modifier of 2.0, but I have not tested this.<br />
<br />
A side effect of this damage-dependancy is that Druid aggro scales much better with gear (in general) than Warrior aggro does.<br />
<br />
:D Bears are very good at holding <b>large groups of mobs</b>. Swipe may only hit 3 targets, however by cycling through the group spamming Swipe, a great deal of aggro can be generated -- without having to switch stances and risk taking additional damage. (To compare, Cleave is tied to next-melee-strike and only hits 2 mobs.) Swipe receives the same aggro modifier as Maul.<br />
<br />
:D Druids are <b>immune to Polymorph, Hex, and Humanoid MC</b> (Priest ability, NOT special &quot;charm&quot; effects like Hakkar!!) while in Bearform. This is a large advantage while fighting mobs with these abilities.<br />
<br />
:D If <b>rooted or snared</b> by anything besides Daze/Blastwave, a Bear can quickly double-shift to <b>break the effect</b>. This really shines on fights where the mob roots or snares the tank and then runs after an innocent healer -- especially when the shift is followed by:<br />
<br />
:D <b>Feral Charge</b>. Effectively, this is Intercept on a 15 second cooldown that does not require changing stances. Knocked back? Mash Feral Charge, and be Yo-Yo Bear! Can be followed by Growl (Taunt) for extra effectiveness.<br />
<br />
There are, of course, disadvantages as well, and in order to honestly discuss Druid tanking, they must be considered:<br />
<br />
 :( Inablity to use consumables while in forms. This prevents a bear from chugging a Major healing potion after a damage spike. Annoying, but I generally exploit this by using a Stoneshield potion before engaging a boss. After all, I'm not using that 2m cooldown for anything else.<br />
<br />
:( Inability to use a shield, and therefore inability to block. This is part of the counter to high druid AC. It also means we cannot spam Shield Block to attempt to prevent Crushing Blows. <b>This is the main point of contention. See a later post for more information.</b><br />
<br />
:( Inability to parry, also a counter to high mitigation.<br />
<br />
:( Poor +Defense itemization on leather, meaning that a geared out bear will take more crits than a geared out Warrior. (However, see mitigation and HP advantage.)<br />
<br />
:( Fewer &quot;Oh crap!&quot; buttons. No Shield Wall (every 30 minutes), no Last Stand. Bears are more dependant on passively mitigating the spikes rather than avoiding them or actively countering them.<br />
<br />
:( No reactive fear counter. This is the big one: Bears are totally dependant on their group to remove Fear effects. This will be less important to Alliance players since they have Fear Ward.<br />
<br />
:( No flat -10% damage from Defensive Stance. This applies after mitigation, however: for a Warrior at 60%, defensive stance removes roughly 10% of the remaining 40%: totalling an average of 64% -- not 70%!. This applies more heavily to magic damage. (Note: Does the defensive bonus apply after resistances? I am not sure on this one.)<br />
<br />
In conclusion, given equal gear, equal spec, etc., a Druid will take more damage over time than a Warrior: But they will take it in a more dependable manner. This can be valuable on some fights (especially ones that involve giant unblockable melee spikes and spell crits.) The aggro mechanics are completely different, and will favor various different fights, though generally Bears will hold more aggro.<br />
<br />
The question <i>Who is a better tank?</i> is akin to <i>Who is a better pilot?</i> The answer depends on what kind of bird they are flying. Some fights are helicopter fights, some are hangglider fights. Some are jumbo jets, and some are F-16s. Druids are not better or worse than a Warrior at tanking: They are simply different. By utilizing their strengths and working to counter their weaknesses, a group or raid can have options available to it that it did not have before, and strengths that it didn't know it had.</div>

		<div>If you don't want to commit to a full bear (or even full feral or hybrid!) build, you can still greatly enhance your tank viability in 5-10man runs by spending a measly 11 points in Feral:<br />
<br />
5/5 Ferocity: The rage cost reduction on Maul is a huge help.<br />
3/5 Feral Instinct: More aggro is good, and more sneakiness is fun.<br />
1/1 Feral Charge: Love this; save 10 rage vs. all knockbacking mobs!<br />
2/? Discretionary. I'd spend them on filling out Feral Instinct, on bash duration, or more crits.<br />

For reference, before any raid drops, a Bear can achieve, unbuffed:<br />
6000hp<br />
11500ac<br />
and enough str/agi to hold aggro substantially well.<br />
<br />
With raid drops, a Bear can break 10khp and hit the 15kac mark, with enough str/crit/agi to hold aggro over anyone. <br />
<br />
Will detail this more later.</div>
