			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I remember when I was younger. You couldn't get me to do homework if you baited me with a trip to Disneyland laced with a can of Coca Cola, and a bowl of Top Ramen (these were delicate days in the Gill Household, I might have only had two twinkies in my life at the time). <br />
<br />
I had dreams of dirt bikes, and surf boards, and climbing Mount Everest. I still dream of Mount Everest. Some part of me still wants to sit my old man on the peak and break the world record for the oldest man to summit the highest geological point on this floating rock of space (and he'd do it, too, telling stories about Jerry Connors all the way to the top, and everyone else he used to go on his crazy backpacking trips with). <br />
<br />
Seeing better in hindsight, as I always do, it was that active need to be a part of something creative that was always keeping me from doing my homework.<br />
<br />
It wasn't until I was involved in the High School marching band that I started to give a darn about anything academic (besides chasing girls I had absolutely no chance with). <br />
<br />
If I didn't hold a C average (which might sound simple for the majority of my friends) I couldn't play in the pep band, the jazz band or the marching band. It gave me new focus. It set a bar. If I could manage to get the classes I was good at (band, spanish) to outweigh the classes I couldn't keep my brain straight on (math, english, science), I could maybe harness that 2.0 GPA to keep me in those extra curricular activities that got me in and out of day and night and kept me going on from point A to point B with a smile on my face, and not a hunch in my shoulders. <br />
<br />
It wasn't until I got the freedom of a Driver's License, a stunning set of wheels (subtitled 1986 Toyota Corolla that belonged to my golf pro grandfather before he suffered from his life and freedom debilitating stroke), and a desire to explore the roads of my very own city that I'd never driven down before, that I finally had a creative interest to make school projects into something that were just a little bit bigger than the minimum requirements to *pass.* <br />
<br />
I set myself a goal a little time before receiving my Driver's License. I wanted to be king of the band nerds. That title has its very own, in “Drum Major” for those in the know., and for the moment it was all I needed to succeed in getting that Driver's License, too. <br />
<br />
If I kept my grades good, and did extremely well in the classes that kept my GPA up, I would gear myself better to not only be Drum Major, but also have the 3.0 GPA my parents required of me to get Driver’s Ed classes. <br />
<br />
I hadn't quite learned the concept of end-game objective, maybe just skirmish survival and success. It was enough to get me to latch onto some small idea of first-world hope. <br />
<br />
As time went on, and I succeeded in these projects that I'd set in front of me, I never bothered to set additional goals (well, maybe have a girlfriend, but that was either hit-or-miss along the way). Without having learned the concept of a long-term goal setting, my short-term objectives became end-game procedures, and I never prepared for the steps after. Waving a baton seemed good enough for survival.<br />
<br />
After I graduated high school, I really had no idea what I was supposed to do next. I followed the tides of chaos that everyone else in my predicament seemed to do. I attended the local community college and enrolled in classes that sounded interesting. I was even marked by the music program as a desirable, and asked to join a couple of the performance ensembles. I couldn’t see an end-game, or a goal in any of them, so i continued to list. I continued to enroll in classes and drop out of them. I couldn’t find anything creative to hold onto. <br />
<br />
Those years while I tried to find whatever pathway that I was destined to follow; that I was so forcefully molded through in the duress of my formulative years was no longer a cast constraining my path, but the freedom itself became a crutch. Without the guidance of force, I listed; floated through those ethereal planes of reason that lack motivation.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, I succeeded. Sometimes, I failed, and hit rock bottom. Sometimes, time, and time again. <br />
<br />
Somehow, I survived.<br />
<br />
Somehow, I joined a band that spoke spanish (ZING!).<br />
<br />
Somehow, I met the woman that I married (DOUBLE ZING!)<br />
<br />
Somehow, we were blessed by not only two beautiful boys, but also their creative stories that make us smile every day, and their cunning ploys that make us laugh harder than even the wittiest of our jokes on one another.<br />
<br />
On days like today,I find myself at work, where I hustle. I churn brain butter. I burn that midnight oil, and I work harder than I ever have in my entire life up until this moment, and I not only work hard, I work *smart.* <br />
<br />
In the company of others around me, I teach them how to do what I do, and how to learn how to do it without the need of asking for assistance, but to break things down methodically, and learn how it all works. <br />
<br />
In the back of my mind, I look at my title. I look at my function. I look at the beauty the job that puts food on my table provides my family, and I smile. <br />
<br />
Here I sit, making my own homework. Creating a reflection on my day. Making sure I learn important things from it. <br />
<br />
I didn't learn this in school. <br />
<br />
I learned it in my heart. And I will continue to look into my heart to know what things I need to learn, to do better at, and succeed. <br />
<br />
As Robert Frost was once quoted as saying, &quot;Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired.&quot;</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>In a vehicle, when you adjust the air to be hot or cold, this is done by what is called a Blend Door. The blend door motor on my truck appears to have died with the door stuck on heat. It was ok through the winter but now that we are hitting mid 80's at times... holy shit it gets hot. Time to replace it, the dealer wanted over $300 so I figure I'll do it myself as the motor only cost $50 w/ shipping.<br />
<br />
My GoogleFu showed me its a common problem and the motor is a simple 2 screws to R&amp;R, easy! <br />
<br />
Armed with my tools I dive in... apparently there is a bezel that covers the motor, that has 3 screws. No biggie... oh wait, the 3rd one is in accessible due to center console covering it. Damnit!  :wtf:<br />
<br />
Google console removal instructions, its 2 nuts, 2 screws and unhooking a couple wiring harnesses. Ok whatever, I start removing it... it's bracket runs under the front seat brackets. WTF... ! So, I now end up tearing out both front seats, unhook all the airbag crap and wiring harnesses to those, yank'em out. Next I am able to manhandle the center console out and toss it next to the seats. Now I get the final screw out of the bezel and remove it: Wala, the blend door motor is sitting there easily accessable.<br />
<br />
Two screws it falls right out.<br />
<br />
/sigh :rlymad:<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.huntingnut.com/images/temp/cab2.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
<br />
I stuck only the front seat back in to make it drivable and left the rest out until the replacement motor arrives. I want to make sure the replacement works fine before I stick all the other crap back in. This motor appears to go bad frequently so it must be a cash cow for dealers because it requires so many shop hours to tear all the other shit out before you even get to the motor. <br />
<br />
Damn all you engineers that made it this way! :ohreally:</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>MAN. My wife and I went swimming today with the kids, today. <br />
<br />
I spent yesterday putting some drywall up in a mold abatement project with a very old friend. He is the father of an ex-girlfriend, but I knew him for 10, maybe 15 years before his daughter and I ever dated, and he was always really cool. Never thought I would be one who would work with his hands, but working with him a couple times the last 2 months, its a wonderful feeling working for a guy with just a real confident go-easy attitude verse the &quot;DO MORE DAMNIT&quot; attitude of my father in law.<br />
<br />
My father-in-law has his reasons (mostly because he is not his own boss, he has even bigger &quot;DO MORE DAMNIT&quot; attitude above him, so it has to be dealt with a trickle-down sort of discipline). I respect them. <br />
<br />
The difference between the two is great. I get paid less with the old friend, but I enjoy the work because it involves much more control and learning than what I've already built up with my Father-in-law boss. <br />
<br />
Yesterday, I came home to my very upset wife, because I was supposed to be home an hour earlier so I could get the dog to the vet and have him vaccinated, and even though I was still able to meet the necessary time frame to do so, and did, it stressed her out. The boys, who are learning potty training, literally soiled every bit of carpet that has been off limits to them before. They &quot;shit the bed&quot; so to speak. <br />
<br />
She is totally understanding of it all. Even though she knows he is my ex-girlfriend's father, she is very accepting of it. SHe knows I have always seen him as both a father figure and a friend, and that their family is close to me, but she knows that my relationship with him gets me closer and closer to my General Contractor's license. She understands my therapeutic need to build things, make things, use my tools, and be a true craftsman, and call shots. That is an amazing feeling. And at the end of the day when all promises are fulfilled she is okay with it. Hell, I'll even go uncensored on y'all and say that Saturday Night is definitely seated very well in the top 10, possibly top 5 most memorable evenings together as man and wife (and beyond). <br />
<br />
So today we went swimming. My brother in-law-in-law was there with his wife (my sister-in-law), my little sister, and all of our kids, and we had a ball. The pool was all to ourselves, and we just had a great time. The boys got closer to learning how to swim (I think my younger boy has no idea that he can drown, because he just kept jumping straight into the water when no one was even near him. Very crazy, and he huffed down water like it was crack on several occasions, followed by laughing and gurgling and coughing, not too distant from our adrenaline like screams. <br />
<br />
In all this, my wife took in a whole lot of sun. She has a beautiful, natural olive complexion in her skin-tone, and when she gets sunlight, she becomes <i>radiant</i>. <br />
<br />
Plus, she also has decided to start working out to almost Insanity proportions. She spent half an hour on a yoga mat doing all sorts of crazy things I'd never imagine her capable of. <br />
<br />
It reminded me of the first day I started my current job. Hard concrete demo work with jackhammer and all. After 2 hours of lugging 50 pounds of concrete at a time, I puked all over myself and the job site. THe guys I was working with thought I was suffering a heart attack. Maybe I was, but I managed to live through it, and still have my current job. Those guys aren't even with the company anymore - I guess the boss, the work, the compensation maybe? - it got to them and they're not longer here.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, after all the hard work, my wife was in inexorable pain, exhausted, and after getting the strength to get into the shower, she threw up in it. I knew it would happen. It happens to the best of us. Like me, she worried she was suffering a heart attack - maybe she was, maybe she wasn't. I doubt it though, I think she just taxed herself that much, and when you do, your body realizes it has toxins in there it needs to quickly get rid of, and it did. <br />
<br />
After all that vomit in the tub was washed down. Her trek down stairs almost left her incapable of getting back up (but she did), she still looked radiant. That sunlight drawing out more melatonin from her skin, her pores probably cleaned from both our years of sedentary lifestyle being flushed so quickly. She looked beautiful. <br />
<br />
In this big huge world filled with murder. People stabbing eachother. People killing eachother with baits and traps. <br />
<br />
For God's sake. I am not afraid to say I truly believe there is something bigger than just the human species for it to be so beautiful. I am truly happy to be where I am right now, and feel as though the future is wide open. I have to put my head down, and stare at the ground, because I have an intrinsic desire to never let pride consume me, but I am so thankful for these days my wife and I have together, where we get to sit down on the couch, in the quiet, with everyone in the house asleep, and just talk about these crazy things we go through, and we still manage to love eachother as much as we do. <br />
<br />
I hope that everyone has something as great as we have. Maybe just for a few minutes a day if that is all they can spare. When it happens, it is so glorious.</div>
