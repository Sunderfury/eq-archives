<u>Synopsis</u>: To understand why Iranian/US relations are so fucked, you have to understand the history of what happened.<br />
<br />
<b>Shia and the Martyr Complex</b>:<br />
<a href="http://www.islamfortoday.com/shia.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ali</a> was one of the <i>caliphs</i> succeeding Mohammed. When Ali died, there was a struggle for power over who should be the new caliph. Ali's second son, Husayn, died in Karbala, fighting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husayn_bin_Ali" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yazid's forces</a>. Husayn's death at Karbaba set the standard for bravery in the face of overwhelming force, as well as defining death due to overwhelming force as a virtue to be admired and emulated.<br />
<br />
<b>The Concessions</b>:<br />
During the 19th Century, Russia and Britain were involved in a power struggle politely called The Great Game. In 1813, Persia had lost a 9-year long war with Russia, the treaty ending it required them, among other things, to give up claims on the Caucasus (for the geographically handicapped, that would be the region between the Caspian and Black Seas). Losing a war with Russia won interest by England, and the rules of The Great Game were somewhat simple: if it hurts the other guy, then we want some.<br />
<br />
The Reuter Concession was pitched as the way to modernize the economy of Persia/Iran by turning its entire economy over to the British. This was so unpopular that the regime had to cancel it. In 1891, the regime signed a tobacco concession with the British, giving the Imperial Tobacco Corporation a total monopoly of all tobacco grown, bought and sold in Iran. The Tobacco Revolt was fueled by fatwas, and increasingly violent demonstrations. In the end the regime had to pay off the Brits to cancel the concession.<br />
<br />
In 1901, D'Arcy managed to get a 60-year oil concession from Iran for a small payment and a promise of 16% of profits. Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, later British Petroleum) cooked the books so egregiously that in 1932, the concession was cancelled. A newer agreement in 1933 gave Teheran a more straighforward, less crooked, arrangement for revenues: a per-barrel royalty, not some arrangement based on accounting practices that remind any modern reader of Enron; and giving up land claims: if oil was under <i>your</i> land, APOC could seize it even if they never drilled, or if the wells pumping it were miles away. Yet APOC still decided to screw the Iranians every possible way they could.<br />
<br />
Shortchanging Iran to the tune of several billion dollars, and repeatedly defaulting on the promises made to Iranians by AIOC [1], the Iranian legislature voted to revoke the concession in 1950. Much of the events of 1949 to 1953 could be described as <i>must hurt the British no matter what the cost</i>. The British would answer along the lines of <i>We English have had hundreds of years of experience on how to treat the Natives. Socialism is all right back home, but out here, you have to be the master.</i><br />
<br />
<b>The Fall of Mossaddeq</b>:<br />
The events of 1949-53 didn't happen in a vacuum. In the US, tensions were building that would become called the Korean War. Mossaddeq was a skilled speaker, but his skills were primarily focused on Iranian audiences. His techniques were perceived in the West as unstable melodramatics. Fearing that Mossaddeq might till Soviet-ward, the US overthrew him to reinstall the Shah.<br />
<br />
<b>Nationalizing the oilfields</b>:<br />
In January 1973, the Shah nationalized the oilfields, finishing what Mossadeq started 22 years earlier. Before the US could overthrow the Shah, the Yom Kippur war changed the political landscape.<br />
<br />
<b>Carter's big mouth and the lead up to the Iranian Revolution</b>:<br />
President Carter liked to push human rights. Yet he chose to praise the Shah when the Shah was cracking down on his people. Khomeni called the President a hypocrite who promoted human rights only when it was convenient for the US. Slanderous editorials in state run Iranian papers criticizing Khomeni led to riots. Troops killing protesters, including mullahs, pushed most of the population to support Khomeni (who was seen as an upright and pious man). This pushed Khomeni into the frontlight and focused the country's attention on him. Khomeni believed that the US (as well as Israel and the Soviet Union) were the cause of all evil in the world. The Iranian people were extremely anti-American by the early 1970s. The Shah was seen as a puppet of the US: hurting the Shah was hurting the US, deposing the Shah was gaining freedom from the US. <br />
<br />
The protests in '73 were similar to the protests in '63, but this time, instead of having large street demonstrations, Khomeni urged people to strike instead. The same general, who in '63 earned the title &quot;butcher of Teheran,&quot; was placed in charge of suppressing the protests. As in 1963, martial law was declared. Several hundred people were killed in military crackdowns around Teheran. When Carter called the Shah to express his support, the Shah liked what he said so much, that a transcript was published in the state run papers. This led the public to believe that Carter approved of the massacre. This only enraged the population. For coverage of the revolution, and the hostage situations, I refer you to chapters 6 and 7 of the book. One should note that the planes carrying the hostages did not take off until the Reagan's oath of office was completed.<br />
<br />
<b>Iran-Contra</b>:<br />
Part of the Reagan campaign for the presidency revolved around slamming Carter for trying to negotiate with the Iranian &quot;hostage takers.&quot; Yet the Reagan administration covertly sold proscribed weapons to those very same people. Folks like to believe that there were &quot;moderates&quot; in the Iranian government who could be dealt with. Some lesser known scandals, like BCCI[2] grew out of the influence of some of the middle-men in the arms-for-hostages negotiation. The policies of publically claiming one thing, while doing the opposite in secrecy lead the Iranians to do very frustrating things, most noticably ignoring political posturing by the US.<br />
<br />
<b>The Iran-Iraq war</b>:<br />
Saddam was fooled by his yes-men into believing that the Iranians wanted to get rid of the mullahs, and that a popular uprising would happen when he invaded Iran. Instead, the Iranians rallied around their leaders.<br />
<br />
<u>Memorable quote</u>: The only way to understand the twenty five year confrontation between Iran and the United States is to know the history of the relationship. Contained in that history are all of the elements of our current impasse. Most Iranians know that history - or some warped version of it - all too well. Most Americans know it too little. To a certain extent, that is the first of many profound  differences  that lie at the heart of our belligerent stand-off.<br />
<br />
<b>After the book was finished</b>:<br />
President bush decided to interfere with the Iranian elections by broadcasting demands. Just like Osama bin Laden chose to interfere with the 2004 US elections by broadcasting demands. Voting for bush was seen as voting against binLaden, just like voting for Ahmadinejad was seen as patriotic: it was voting <i>against</i> bush.<br />
<br />
<u>Notes</u><br />
1 - You can read more details starting at page 52 of the book.<br />
2 - The BCCI scandal was central to Iran-Contra as well as funding terrorists, laundering money (both terrorist and drug money) and the careers of both Presidents Bush. Several books have been written on the subject, almost all end the matter with President GHW Bush quashing all further prosecutions in the incidents.<br />
