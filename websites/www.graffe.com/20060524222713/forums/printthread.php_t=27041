			<div><strong>Tips for Making Money in EQ2 for the Soloer</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>Got inspiried to write this because of another post so I thought I would share some of my methods I discovered on how to make cash in EQ2.  I'm not the richest person on the server by any means but this method affords me to buy most of the best gear possible for my level with the AdeptI's I need along the way...<br />
<br />
1.  Harvest anything and everything<br />
<br />
Pick spots to solo where there are lots of harvest nodes spawning.  If you see a harvest node, go and get it! Especially mining.  The rares are worth a great amount of money.  If you decide to keep the rare and make an AdeptIII spell for yourself, that's always an option too.  Commonlands/Antonica rare is Silver and Coral and easily sell for 6-10 gold depending on your server.  Each Tier has it's own rare, and all are for the same thing. Adept III's.  <br />
<br />
With the exception to food items, tradeskillers are always looking for people to sell harvested goods.  Mined items and Roots are always big sellers.  <br />
<br />
2.  Always keep a Wholesaler task in your Quest Journal and do them as often as you can.<br />
<br />
Wholesaler tasks earn a great amount of silver. 12s for Tier 2 and 48s for Tier3. They will usually make you more money than you would get selling your harvested items to tradeskillers.  <br />
<br />
Tip: If you have 15 of an item in your inventory but don't have the quest updates for it because you had them previous to getting your quest, hand the items over to a friend and ask him/her to hand them back to you 1 at a time.  When you do this, you will get quest credit and will be able to claim your payment from the wholesaler. <br />
<br />
Tip 2:  Keep an eye out for people selling off stock on the broker for really cheap prices.   During the evening hours it's not uncommon to be able to get a wholesaler task, buy all the items for the task at the broker and get your reward from the Wholesaler.  All done without even leaving the zone. It may not be a lot of silver but it's profit nonetheless.  Buying wolesaler quest items from the broker will give you quest updates in your journal.<br />
<br />
Whatever you have left over, sell it from your INN room at the broker.  Set your price near the bottom of the list but not too far.  Price it slightly below the lowest guy with lots of stock, that way you will sell your product quickly.  Don't immediately sell for the cheapest price because many times those players only have a few in stock anyway and will be sold before you even put your own wares on the market.<br />
<br />
3.  Get to know the cash loot items from dungeons and how much they are worth at the vendors.<br />
<br />
It's surprising how many players don't check the vendors before they list items for sale on the market.  As we know money loot in EQ2 comes by form of useless equipment without stats on it with high level requirements.  Things that nobody would ever wear but sell quite well to vendors.   Players often sell these wares for LESS than vendors give, so all you do is check for them and buy them out and run straight to the vendor.  11pm to midnight is prime time for this.  <br />
<br />
some examples: <br />
<br />
-All level 30-39 Tradeskiller pages are worth around 50 silver each from the vendors.  Very few players actually need these pages yet so most of them get sold straight to the vendor.  There are players out there who do try and sell them, and often for very cheap.<br />
<br />
-Broadcloth Pantaloons.  These sell for 50+ silver as well, some days I can find 3 of them for sale for 20-30silver each on the black market. <br />
<br />
-Opalline Ring.  48 Silver If I remember correctly. <br />
<br />
There are many more to list but just keep a note of them when you see them and check whenever you are at the black market.<br />
<br />
4.  Keep an eye out for &quot;?&quot; for Collection quests.  There is a major market boom for these right now, and it doesn't hurt to take advantage.  Everyone (at least on my server) is going crazy for bone collections for the Petrified Eyes (race illusion items).  Also, the Evocation, Conjuration, Abjuration, etc.. Collections reward with a great item that sells for good gold.  Doesn't hurt to collect for those as well if for nothing else than to sell the quest components to others.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I Hope this info helps.  It may sound a bit tedious, but if you are out there soloing, you might as well pick up some harvest nodes between kills and generate some cash.  The rest is done with the time before you are about to log off, a good half hour is usually all it takes to cash in on most of your harvests for the evening.</div>

The rest is good, though the collection quests should also be done while you are in group, as often it is easier to get the higher collections at a lower level that way.</div>

I agree, however that's all stuff you can do while levelling to keep a steady income going.  I don't solo much myself but when I do, these are the things I do to get a little extra coin.<br />
<br />
I hate Levelling too fast and not having my adeptIII's though. :(</div>

some players <i>enjoy</i> doing things others than fight ! I know some who have 200 in all harvesting, even fishing ; some others are 40 crafters and only 10 or 20 adventurers  :grinyes: <br />
that's the pleasure with EQ2, you are not obliged to level like a mad if you prefer doing something else.</div>
