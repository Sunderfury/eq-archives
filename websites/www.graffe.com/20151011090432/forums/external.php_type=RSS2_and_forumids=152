			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>My wife said that it had been shutting down on its own the last couple of days, and when it would power back on, it would explain ventilation issues. I'd taken one apart before and wasn't looking forward to it with this one. <br />
<br />
Nothing about it is mentally or physically difficult, but it is a long process of silliness due to built-in safeguards that keep the end user out of it. <br />
<br />
After about 15 minutes of taking all the screws, clips, and other pieces of protective plastic apart, I finally got to the problem. The single ventilation fan above the processor. frozen stuck. <br />
<br />
No amount of compressed air would get it to spin again. I couldn't find my WD-40. Nobody in the house wanted to admit to where they might have used it last. The longest part was driving to home depot to wait in line to buy a 2 dollar can of the stuff. <br />
<br />
After giving the frozen fan a couple of sprays, a couple of spins, and a couple of shakes, I managed to get it to spin consistantly after testing it with some power. <br />
<br />
after a 2 hour repair, I've avoided:<br />
<br />
1) buying a used OEM replacement fan for $15<br />
2) buying a custom manufactured replacement fan for $20<br />
3) buying a new xbox 360 for $150<br />
4) upgrading to a new xbox one for $350+<br />
<br />
<br />
____<br />
<br />
I hardly use the thing myself. I buy a new game 3 to 4 times a year, and spend about 4-6 hours on each before never playing them again. Its a nice experience, but I've grown out of video games almost entirely ( :-(  ). If I do get any use out of it, it is usually as a media box. <br />
<br />
I don't like owning anything that doesn't work. I prefer to fix anything that breaks down almost immediately - otherwise it might never happen. <br />
<br />
I get a little more life out of this console, maybe up to a year, and if this repair fails, I pick one of the four options above in order to remedy it in the future.</div>
