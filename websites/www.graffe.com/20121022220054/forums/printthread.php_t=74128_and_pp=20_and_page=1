I've never streamed anything, but I'm interested in helping new players learn to play DF. So, I've started streaming live as I play DF. I'm discussing, step by step, what I'm doing and why, and addressing the concerns that a new fortress undergoes. It's not structured except by chronology, and I've never streamed anything before, so I'm sure it's a little rough around the edges, but if you're curious, head on over and take a look. I'll answer any questions you guys have, whether here or at the reddit thread.<br />
<br />
I will say that I'm not sure I could do this for more than about four hours, though - my throat is tired.</blockquote>

</div>Yes! (At least for now). <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/nirruden" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.twitch.tv/nirruden</a> will get you a list of videos I've done. (We're up to four parts now, all the way through Winter of the first year.)<br />

</div>As I mentioned before, if you have any questions (Why X, why not Y, what about Z?) that you come across whule you're watching, juts leave them here (or in the threads on the dwarf fortress subreddit) and I'll answer them. I've already had at least one person asking about why I bring so much wood if I'm embarking in a wooded area. (In the first thread, no less!)<br />
<br />
 My next set of episodes will be Wednesday evening @8pm (UTC -5) and we will cover finishing our well,  hospitals, the metal industry and the military.</blockquote>

You don't want to give invaders the option to spread out, but they must have a path-able route to the fortress, or they stall. Simultaneously, you don't want them to have good sight-lines into the fortress, or they'll fire arrows into it from well-away from the doors.<br />
<br />
2. Doors are 1x1.<br />
<br />
You can do a two-door entryway, but the dwarves will pathfind to the closest route, so since my DEpot doesn't straddle the hallway, the dwarves would favor the southern door. I do intend to get a door up, but this episode (or possibly the next) will be somewhat controversial among the diehards, because I advocate for the &quot;seal the fortress when entry not in use&quot; method of play.<br />
<br />
I'm going to be handing out a large number of wooden training axes and engaging in mass deforestation in the next few episodes, because getting supplies of wood downstairs is a RIGHT F'in NAO level priority at this point. Our large trading session will attract massive migrant influx, and likely get us attacked in Spring of the new year, so it's &quot;fell the trees and get them into the stocks&quot; time.<br />
<br />
We'll also link up the floodgates and start up our well, and lay down some cage traps to deal with a possible early ambush, before starting on a metal/glass industry, a 1x1 walkway/pit combination, a drowning trap (if possible), and more. I've let the game go off pause with idle dwarves a few times when talking, and usually I wouldn't trade nearly as many goods as I did this time, so I'm expecting early Fun and a massive migrant wave shortly.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, we'll be excavating a different route for later wagons, but early on, I need a wagon route, which is why the current entry hall is 3xN and not 1xN. 1xN is much safer, generally.<br />

I'll be firing the broadcast up in about an hour, if you folks are interested in watching.</blockquote>

</div>We tap the aquifer and begin to fill the well in Episode 5 or 6 (I can't recall which). Complex traps (eg. not weapon traps or stonefall traps) also got under way in the previous video with a drowning trap. I was fortunate that the aquifer appears to allow us to stage a drowning trap over our entry tunnel with the use of a pump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple&quot; traps and Pathing priority (I assume you mean for the invaders) will come over the next two episodes, starting with some simple cage traps and a sealable serpentine wagon access, but since I have no iron and no flux on the map, my military is going to be very much a 'last line of defense' sort of issue. I don't trust bronze against iron.</blockquote>
