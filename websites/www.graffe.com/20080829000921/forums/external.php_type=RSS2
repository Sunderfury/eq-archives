				Admitted Pentagon hacker Gary McKinnon lost his appeal to the European Court of Human Rights on Thursday, and is expected to be on a plane to Virginia within three weeks. But -- surprise! -- he's now been diagnosed at 42 with Asperger's syndrome, and his lawyers are asking Home Secretary Jacqui Smith to keep him in London for medical reasons. <br />
<br />
McKinnon is accused of breaching over 90 unclassified Pentagon and NASA systems in 2001 and 2002, and crashing some of them, causing $900,000 in damage. In interviews, McKinnon has admitted the hacking spree (though not the damage) which he says was a search for evidence of a military UFO cover-up. As part of his quest he left this message on an Army computer in 2002: &quot;U.S. foreign policy is akin to government-sponsored terrorism these days.... It was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on September 11 last year ... I am SOLO. I will continue to disrupt at the highest levels.&quot; <br />
<br />
In 2003 McKinnon rejected a written plea offer that would have given him six months to a year in a U.S. low security prison He then fought extradition while claiming that America wanted to ship him off to Guantanamo Bay. He lost his extradition appeal before the House of Lords in July, and turned to the human rights court in a last ditch effort to avoid standing trial in the country he hacked. <br />
<br />
He faces anywhere from six months to six-and-a-half years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines, depending on how much damage he caused, if any, and whether or not he accepts responsibility. Through a quirk of the metric system, this becomes <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/security/0,1000000189,39475039,00.htm" target="_blank">60 years</a>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/aug/28/hacking.security" target="_blank">70 years </a>and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7585861.stm" target="_blank">a life sentence</a> in the British press.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><b><u>What has the internet got against Julie Moult?<br />
</u></b>I've quoted this excerpt because I do feel that Julie Moult is an idiot. Please vote! <a href="http://www.bloggerheads.com/archives/2008/08/julie_moult.asp" target="_blank">(Quoted from Blogspot)</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Looking into some of the hateful and (ahem) inventive crap she's produced for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Athesun.co.uk+%22julie+moult%22" target="_blank">The Sun</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Adailymail.co.uk+%22julie+moult%22" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a> over the years, quite a lot... but really, we are here today to deliver to Julie a well-earned lesson on the mysterious inner workings of Google:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's begin with how 'journalist' Julie <i>thinks</i> Google works:<blockquote><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1048296/Blears-falls-prey-Google-bomb-Attack-Of-The-50-inch-Woman.html" target="_blank"><i>Julie Moult</i> - Blears falls prey to 'Google Bomb' Attack Of The 50-inch Woman</a>:  She would prefer to be known for her trailblazing policies on eco-friendly housing and community cohesion.<br />
  But if the billions of people using Google decide to look for Labour MP Hazel Blears by typing her name into the search engine, a more unlikely image appears.<br />
  The first site you reach features a mock-up 1950s movie poster of the politician in a skimpy outfit.<br />
  Last night, the prank raised the possibility that she was the victim of 'Google Bombing', when internet enthusiasts manipulate rankings on search engines....<br />
  Paul Richards, special adviser to Mrs Blears, shrugged off the stunt.<br />
  He said: 'Hazel is supremely relaxed about this. This is just part of the fun of the internet.'<br />
  Google yesterday denied the politicians had been subjected to Google Bombing, saying the picture's ranking was due to several factors including popularity.<br />
  Google Bombing, when cyber pranksters create dozens, or even hundreds, of 'fake' sites linked to the targeted webpage to make it seem more popular, is something politicians around the world are all too familiar with.<br />
<br />
</blockquote><img src="http://www.bloggerheads.com/images/gbjp.gif" border="0" alt="" />1. Hazel Blears' office isn't bothered about the 'stunt' (which isn't a stunt), but Julie must have her summer story, so she marches on regardless.<br />
  2. Google informs her that it's not a Google bomb (I prefer 'Googlebomb' myself, but nevermind) but in Julie's eyes this is merely a 'denial'... and so she marches on again. Without pausing for breath.<br />
  3. Even if this were Google bombing (it isn't), and even if high profile Google bombs still worked (<a href="http://www.bloggerheads.com/archives/2007/01/googlebombs_fix.asp" target="_blank">they don't</a>), the most effective Google bombs involved genuine web users expressing genuine opinions on genuine websites; they would each stake a fraction of the reputation they had earned online on their opinion that George W. Bush is a miserable failure, Tony Blair is a liar, and/or John Prescott is a f**kwit. They would do this by linking to a target website with the required word(s), thereby as a group making it a top search result for a word or words that (usually) did not even appear on the target page.<br />
  4. Speaking of that f**kwit John Prescott, <a href="http://www.bloggerheads.com/photoshopping/" target="_blank">I'm a photoshopper</a> and <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=john%20prescott" target="_blank">I created an image that is one of the top Google Image search results for his name</a>. It became a top search result because it is an amusing and relevant* image with a relevant filename, hosted on a well-regarded and relevant website (backingblair.co.uk) and it has remained there through many image database updates because people think it is funny (and relevant) and keep linking to it.<br />
  5. <a href="http://www.bbdo.co.uk/blog/" target="_blank">Beau Bo d'Or</a>, who created the image that Julie Moult is fussing about (and the Daily Mail is using without permission), is - I am not ashamed to say - a better and cleverer photoshopper than I am. He is highly regarded, and his work featured at the online art community site b3ta.com or his own website at bbdo.co.uk (+ heady.co.uk) is highly regarded and regularly linked to. <br />
  6. It is the combination of this reputation (based on general interest in past efforts plus specific interest in this single relevant* effort) and a simple, relevant filename <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=hazel%20blears" target="_blank">that has Beau Bo d'Or in control of not one but two top Google Image search results for the query 'hazel blears'</a>.<br />
  It. Has. Nothing. To. Do. With. Google. Bombing.  <br />
  What Julie Moult is describing is - for the most part - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_sock_puppet" target="_blank">sock-puppeting</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing" target="_blank">astroturfing</a>, but that doesn't have anything to do with Beau Bo d'Or's image being the top search result for 'hazel blears', either.<br />
  She's an idiot.<br />
  (*John Prescott is a very sexy man in much the same way that Hazel Blears is a very tall woman. Both images are relevant to their respective queries... and in a very similar way.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
**************************************************  ****<br />
<br />
It is my considered opinion that Julie Moult is an idiot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  **************************************************  ****<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1048296/Blears-falls-prey-Google-bomb-Attack-Of-The-50-inch-Woman.html" target="_blank"><br />

</a><br />
<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1048296/Blears-falls-prey-Google-bomb-Attack-Of-The-50-inch-Woman.html" target="_blank">She doesn't know or care how Google works, even when the people from Google explain it to her</a>, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.<br />
  Julie Moult was also behind <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article66292.ece" target="_blank">a dangerous claim of &quot;Muslim yobs&quot; attacking soldiers returning from Afghanistan</a> that turned out to be totally without foundation (see follow-ups <a href="http://www.ministryoftruth.me.uk/2006/10/20/so-sang-the-blithe-reporter-man/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.septicisle.info/2007/01/scum-watch-feeble-corrections-and.html" target="_blank">here</a>).<br />
  I could go on (and on and on), but I'm confident that the above and <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article85048.ece" target="_blank">her article about &quot;Nazi racoons&quot;</a> will be enough for most people.<br />
  You may wish to read more before forming an opinion of your own, and I totally respect that. Feel free to browse through Julie Moult's many articles in <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Athesun.co.uk+%22julie+moult%22" target="_blank">The Sun</a> and <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=site%3Adailymail.co.uk+%22julie+moult%22" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a> for any redeeming acts/articles (such as <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article27509.ece" target="_blank">her selfless service in search of little Maddie McCann</a>).<br />
  Once you're done and you have arrived at your opinion, I'd like you to take the following steps:<br />
  <br />
<br />
<center>=========== THE JULIE MOULT IMAGE CHALLENGE ==============</center><br />
   Step One - Create an image featuring the words &quot;Julie Moult is an idiot&quot; (or &quot;Julie Moult is not an idiot, but instead a much-misunderstood campaigner for truth and a very nice person once you get to know her&quot;).<br />
   Step Two - Include the words 'julie' and 'moult' in the filename for your image.<br />
   Step Three - Publish it on your website or weblog in a post explaining what it is and why it's there (including, if you like, these steps and a link back to this article).<br />
   Step Four (optional) - If you really mean business, put her name in your article title and maybe even drop in some 'ALT' or 'Title' goodness for your image.<br />
  :: Please keep in mind that Julie Moult might be willing and able to sue you if she can prove that she isn't an idiot (though I'm quietly confident that this won't be a problem).<br />
  :: You may also wish to include a picture/glimpse of yourself in your image, as I have (above), so Julie is certain that real people, not invisible Google pixies, lurk behind the eventual results.<br />
  Notable search results will be posted below as soon as they start appearing, and a prize will be awarded for the best relevant performance in Google Images (not including mine).<br />
  Good luck to you all. I hope to see you in the top row soon.<br />

<br />
Sweet Blue Agave. A cactus that takes 6 years to mature fully enough to harvest and even then only the purest heart of the plant is useful unless you are in the business of manufacturing &quot;goat piss under glass&quot; like Jose fucking Cuervo. Yeah -- I said &quot;goat-piss&quot; -- mainly to get your attention, you knock-kneed camel smoking moron; largely because I know how fucking thick skulled you scrote-breathing pasty white fucks are. Ensconced in your little suburban milktoast apartments, swilling your Budweiser beer and eating your Raman noodles! Eat my fuck whitey! And then go V-Blog about it on YouTube like your insignifcunt lives actually make a fuck towards the continuation of the species. Die the hell off already.<br />
<br />
You want 'alternative fuels' you fat fucks? Try walking lately? I am guessing by the size of your flat-asses that bipedal locomotion is strictly out of the question at this point anyway. And besides -- its &quot;RRRRRRRRRRRiiiiiiiiiVAA!&quot; you gods-damned troglodytes! You have to actually roll your &quot;R's&quot;! try to imagien you are actually pleasuring a women. I know its a fucking stretch and shit. You don't cry out -- &quot;REE-BAH!&quot; You can't celebrate a cockrocking bodyshot by shouting out the name of a washed up Country Western Sitcom construct!<br />
<br />
You know what? Fuck this planet. Seriously. In the neck with a tactical nuke up every ass from sea to shining sea. You want to use corn for biofuels? Corn is for fucking tortillas you retards! Not for filling up your SUV's stank-hole! You people have it all exactly backwards. Your &quot;lifestyle&quot; isn't worth preserving. In fact -- I'll see your lifestyle and raise you a knifestyle straight to the jugular. I don't give a god-damn fuck about the polar ice caps! Canada is too fucking cold anyway.<br />
<br />
Agave &gt; you, you dickless pill popping twats! And please never forget that the sum of your entire civilization isn't worth $2.50 these days with the collapse of your paper airplane currency, so shove that back up your fucking nose where it belongs, you shit slurping imperialist-humping, terror-loving, snot-mongering, sell-out whores.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So I recently set up a network storage device which also has a network USB printer connection, great device and really very handy. However, I want to now back up my DVD's onto my NAS so if I log into my network outside of my house, or say upstairs, I can watch my old dvd's without having to have the dvd's with me. I'm at a loss to find programs that work to rip the DVD's, all of which i've legitimately  purchased, onto my network. Help my graffites, you're my only hope!</div>

<b>&quot;It's a tremendous night for America,&quot; said Ed Rollins, a Republican campaign consultant who has worked on high-profile political campaigns including Gov. Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential bid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously, my party wasn't going to do it [nominate a black candidate for the White House] so I'm glad Democrats did it,&quot; he said. &quot;We're in a real close, real tight race. And this guy has a real shot at winning. At the end of the day, this is an extraordinary candidate.&quot;</b>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>so i fly my grandmother, uncle and mother to florida for a family vacation the last week of may.  for my grandmother and uncle it maybe the last time they see family down in florida. my grandmother is 84 and failing health and my uncle was battling bone and lung cancer.  he also needs oxygen all the time. the flight down was nice and smooth.  the lead flight attendant guy was good and cracked jokes to keep people happy.  he even jokingly pointed out his house as a 'surprise' to see from the plane. the vacation was good, got my grandmother to disney for the first time and she had a lot of fun even if it was hot out that day.  my uncle got to see his children.  <br />
<br />
so vacation is over and we get to airport to fly home and this is when it all turns to shit.  we are boarding the plane but the head flight attendant was standing in the door and would not move when she saw my uncle.  his color is pale as he was on chemo and radiation for his cancer.  she stands in his way for like 5 minutes.  when it was hot my uncle would get anxiety attacks because he thinks he cant breath. with this bitch standing there just staring at him and starts to get an attack.  we finally get her to move and him sitting down.  we get the ac turned on him and he starts to calm down and breathing normal again.  the flight attendant kept saying i dont like his color and walking away. <br />
<br />
half hour after the plane was supposed to take off we are still sitting there.  the pilot is talking to my grandmother and the flight attendant shows up talking on a cell phone.  she asks what is my uncle's liter flow is for his o2 and how many batteries do we have and how long each one lasts.  i answer her questions and she walks away with no further explanation.  she comes back 5 minutes later and says sorry our medical people say your uncle and grandmother can not fly on the plane. according to her my grandmother said she was short of breath.  i talked to my grandmother after we were off the plane and she told me she didnt say that.  also the person sitting next to her said they were picking on my grandmother while i was getting our carry on bags. the reason for my uncle not being able to travel is his color and that if they need to raise the liter flow for his o2 we wouldnt have enough battery for a 3 hour flight.  i had 4 batteries at 3hrs a piece on his normal setting so even if i had to put it on the highest i would still have over 3hrs of battery between all of them.  they wouldnt let me talk to the medical people and wouldnt explain to me why i would have to increase his liter flow.<br />
<br />
they told me my options are that my mother and i can fly home and leave my 84yr old grandmother in failing health and my uncle batting cancer in florida.  i asked them do you really consider this an option and the cs rep said yes i do.   they offered to try and find us a flight on another airline.  i said so what they can kick us off that one 30 minutes later because someone doesnt like my uncle's color.  they just kinda look at me.  i asked 1 of them if they kick off everyone who has an anxiety attack and her response was silence with a guilty look on her face as she said no.  they said they would reimburse me for my uncle's and grandmother's tickets but not my mother's or mine as we were still able to fly.  i told them that was unacceptable.  she said ok let me check with supervisor.  she came back a couple of minutes later and said ok we will reimburse all of the tickets.<br />
<br />
so i go and rent a suv to drive home to mass in. we needed to suv for the baggage space and my grandmother's wheelchair.  we get home in 24hrs with a lot of difficulty for my uncle and grandmother. so here it is the end of august and they have only reimbursed me for 1 of the 4 tickets and i cant stay on hold forever through their dumbass automated system to get to a person and when i have gotten through it's never the dept i need to speak with and am on hold forever and usually end up hanging up as i dont have the time to stay on hold for over 20minutes.  <br />
<br />
so to sum it up this fucking bitch ass cuntbag sperm receptical has caused me to still be out several hundred dollars and my grandmother and uncle to be put through the embarrassment of being kicked off a plane and the difficulties of a car ride home.  my uncle also spent one of his last days couped up in a car, uncomfortable and in pain.  unfortunately my uncle was dead within 2 weeks of getting home. im not saying the car ride home killed him but it speed up the process according to the doctors.  <br />
<br />
i pray none of you have to watch a loved one waste away in a hospital room.  telling them to turn off the machines and then watching my uncle slowly die over 7hrs is not a fun time.  my uncle beat throat cancer several years ago.  this time it was bone and lung which were not related to the throat cancer.  he actually beat the bone cancer but the lung cancer just didnt want to go away.  he didnt go down with a fight but atleast he went peacefully in his sleep without pain, well with help from medicine.   <br />
<br />
so now i sit without my uncle around, out a few hundred dollars, a depressed grandmother and no idea how to fix any of it.</div>

I have a 4 socket computer configuration specifically for 7.1 sound, and I have a cable 7.1 creative speakers. The Inspire 7800 I think...<br />
<br />
I see that the 3 cable computer-to-subwoofer cable is detachable... I would love to get a replacement to utilize all speakers, I just...can't find it.... anywhere.<br />
<br />
Anybody  know a place where I can order 7.1 cables to run between my computer and my speakers?</div>
