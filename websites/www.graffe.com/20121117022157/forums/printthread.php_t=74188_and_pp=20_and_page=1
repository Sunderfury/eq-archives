		<blockquote class="restore">I recall the halcyon days of rpg gaming.<br />
<br />
The times when we all got force-fed bullshit and loved it because there were few options available.<br />
<br />
We sucked it up, chowed down heartily, and then requested more, while forcefully complaining that our games or expansions tasted like someone had deposited a corn-filled present in our feedbag of blue porta potty water.<br />
<br />
They were bleak days.<br />
<br />
Enter the modern era and Kings of Amalur.<br />
<br />
The single player and multi-player RPG as a genre has achieved some levels of success and it is PROFITABLE.<br />
<br />
It's the right time to make a storied RPG game.<br />
<br />
The audience is larger.<br />
<br />
Advancements in gameplay and interfaces have been made.<br />
<br />
AND YET KOA IS DETERMINED TO INSIST THAT I CLICK A DIALOG BOX AT EVERY FUCKING STEP, AND MOST TIMES AT LEAST TWICE.<br />
<br />
That's bad enough from an interface standpoint, but what the fuck ever happened to roleplaying games being INTERACTIVE?!<br />
<br />
Why am I WATCHING dialogue instead of participating in it?<br />
<br />
I'm not shelling out my hard-earned money and valuable time to watch a movie, I'm spending my precious commodities playing a video game...or at least I thought I was...instead I'm just watching developer masturbation.<br />
<br />
Who the FUCK thought this level of bullcrap was a good idea?<br />
<br />
It's like meeting jockeys multiplied by a side order of groupthink.<br />
<br />
Fuck your company.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that so many people got shafted as a result of the breakdown, but if that was the level of in-the-box thinking that was going on, someone should have voiced some concern from the player's perspective or perhaps from the QA standpoint.<br />
<br />
Protip - QA works better without fanbois on board and interface design is far more key than voiceovers and cutscenes are.<br />
<br />
People who play games want to PLAY them, not WATCH them.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I should add that I spent over an hour tonight customizing this game so it would run on my specced machine and clicking a lot of boxes, over and over, and reloading the game for options settings...and then I sat therr for 45 minutes as the cutscenes chugged along JUST so i could hit &quot;save&quot; and try the game again later when I was less frustrated.<br />
<br />
I'll probably enjoy it, assuming it runs decently with the settings I have, but the massive cutscenes are segacd/32x era levels of bullshit and they need to be amputated from the industry.<br />
<br />
they're like muscle shirts, stretch pants, yoga pants, or corduroy ocean pacific shorts...just because you CAN implement them in your own area of control doesn't mean you should.</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="restore">I think some genres of game have decreased in quality, MMORPGs in particular.  Aside from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls and rogue likes, RPGs have largely become movies with little intellect or skill invested in the plot.  Take Skyrim for example, there was some fantastic story here, and very little cut scenes, and it was awesome.  The combat kind of sucked, but the environment was great, and more and more RPGs are implementing non terrible combat mechanics.  However, MMORPGs, aside from being highly derivative and clones of one another, usually have garbage combat mechanics, no story line, and the player is irrelevant to to the outcome.  Due to increased trend to casual appeal the MMO component of the genre has faded such that for all intents and purposes it might as well be a match maker game.  The state is actually even worse than that though as the match maker usually has no skill rating component to it, so players are matched up with garbage, hardly a fun affair aside from the emotional exploitation that occurs in the genre.</blockquote>
