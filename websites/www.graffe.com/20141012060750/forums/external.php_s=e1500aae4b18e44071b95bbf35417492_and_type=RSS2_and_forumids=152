<br />
Previous to this, most of the good pizza places in town were <br />
<br />
This place opened in 2000, and was quickly included in Frommer's and became pretty popular.  Showing up during dinner time pretty much any day of the week will be a 45 minute wait to be seated.  Recently I've noted that the local places that have opened more recently have started using a very similar recipe.<br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			22.5 ounces (about 4 1/2 cups) bread flour, plus more for dusting<br />
0.5 ounces (about 1 1/2 tablespoons) sugar<br />
0.35 ounces kosher salt (about 1 tablespoon)<br />
0.35 ounces (about 2 teaspoons) instant yeast<br />
1.125 ounces Butter (about 3 tablespoons)<br />
7 ounces lukewarm spring water<br />
8 ounces whole milk<br />
<br />
Combine flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in bowl of food processor. Pulse 3 to 4 times until incorporated. Add olive butter, milk, and water. Run food processor until mixture forms ball that rides around the bowl above the blade, about 15 seconds. Continue processing 15 seconds longer.<br />
<br />
Transfer dough ball to lightly floured surface and knead once or twice by hand until smooth ball is formed. It should pass the windowpane test. Divide dough into three even parts and place each in a covered quart-sized deli container or in a zipper-lock freezer bag. Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 1 day, and up to 5. Remove from refrigerator, shape into balls, and allow to rest at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking.<br />
<br />
To freeze, wrap in plastic wrap, then place into a freezer bag. Remove as much air as possible, and it should keep for 6+ months.  Place in Fridge for 1 day to thaw.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div><br />
Note: due to the volume:surface area ratio, scaling this downwards will give you different results.  You can scale it upwards for better results, but at that point you'll probably need to have some professional equipment.  In this recipe I say to use spring water. As most people know, the water is one of the most important parts of any good pizza dough.  As you'd have a difficult time sourcing pure glacial melt water, I'm guessing that bottled spring water would work okay, but try to get one with a nice clean non-plasticy flavor.</div>

Ground sirloin, smoked chipotle mayo, lemon garlic butter on fucking everything, Parmesan charred romaine lettuce, and a Kim Kardashian nipple sized slice of smoked Gouda. Yeah Kim. I saw the leaked pictures. That nipple-to-tit ratio is all fucked up. Looks like someone duct taped some salami to a couple of rotten pumpkins. The nipples are almost bigger than the tit area.</div>

			<title>Nerdist with Anthony Bourdain - Americans And Food Create Freaks of Nature</title>

<iframe class="restrain" title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TU6_VrMwDRU?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"  allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen  mozallowfullscreen ></iframe>
<br />
<br />
If you don't follow the nerdist, their format might be a little dizzying, but this particular interview was very interesting to listen to - Yes, it is a youtube link, but it does not really feature any visual at all, it is strictly a listening experience. <br />
<br />
So, that being said, Bourdain drives home several very interesting points, that is actually quite amusing when you think about it. <br />
<br />
1) Chefs who can't cook steaks shouldn't call themselves Chefs. Or even cooks. A cooking competition where one of the contestants cooks a steak should immediately be removed from competition. It has been trivialized down to a science, and all those involved as judge's should know what a steak tastes like, on the best day - which for steak, a steak's best day should be anyday OTHER than its worst day.<br />
<br />
2) Lobster is no longer a gourmet food. It is a 30 dollar insect which over the course of time, whence it was introduced as prison food, slave food, and field fertilizer trickled its way up, because there was only one way to prepare it, and gradually the middle class, the wealthy, the rich, were envious of the poor who learned how to make something edible and wanted to eat it as well.<br />
<br />
3) You can look at the collective of Cambodia, or Vietnam, and see all the militant extremist groups which have made that an area of conflict in the past, and the organizations on the opposite side of the conflict as a whole group with a ferocious history, but as soon as you break these groups into individuals, they're a grandpa, or they're a dad, and they have a wife, and they have kids, and they enjoy a friday night, or a sunday morning just as much as any american, and in their eyes, our trickling, over sensationalized Man vs Food, where a guy shoves as much food in his mouth as possible within an hour, and the house wives with 7 layers of botox and severed skin folded into itself, and the guy making bacon out of bacon with bacon on it in a baconatorburger are all freaks of nature. We, Americans, are shoving our aristocratic nature down the media tubes and making ourselves look like wasteful idiots. We're envious of our 1%, and saying the aristocrats of this nation will eventually fall, while the entire rest of the world get a tiny glimpse at the nature of this nation's mass-media, and say to themselves, &quot;We need to take out this aristocracy called america that is forcing itself onto the rest of the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
4) The fucking Acai berry. The fucking quinoa seed. The fucking CALIFORNIA ROLL. We are taking staple foods which originally come from a nature of simple, humble beginnings, and just trying to survive. Ruining its economic stasis as a staple food for the poor and lower middle class from its source, and over saturating our markets with it, where it goes to waste (expired, processed food), and not leaving enough AT its sources, for people to properly flourish the way they were just SURVIVING before, and not even giving a fair trade of something else that can be harvested as nutritionally and economically beneficial for them. <br />
Take the California Roll. Yes, on the surface, they are very nice. But now, you want to go out for sushi, and you go to a sushi bar, where a guy who went to real sushi chef trainigng under a trained sushi chef for 7 years on just how to handle the rice before even getting to touch the fish is forced to watch you pour soy sauce, and horseradish into a gravy trough, and completely soak his hard work in the damn thing so that every piece of sushi that you ordered, and asked for differentiation, you just completely trivialized it by overbearing your senses with wasabi horseradish, and completely missed the delicate flavors he spent time isolating for you. You should feel lucky that he doesn't grab the katana behind him and lop your head off, which is so conveniently at his waist level. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is a fantastic interview. I love most of these, and this one, like the Aziz Ansari, Tom Hanks, and a handful of others, REALLY stands higher than some of the rest.<br />
<br />
And because it focuses greatly on food, which is a topic of discussion so often found here, I really found it necessary that it be posted here as well.<br />
<br />
Please, I hope you enjoy this.</div>
