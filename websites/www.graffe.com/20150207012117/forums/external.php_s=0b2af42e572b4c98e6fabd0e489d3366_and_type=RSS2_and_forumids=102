			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The past month, my android Kyocera hydro icon had been acting strange while receiving MMS picture attachments as text messages through android messenger from a number of different individuals.<br />
<br />
This past weekend I had it, as I just couldn't send or receive pictures without it interfering in SMS entirely, and I decided to hard reset.<br />
<br />
for no related reason, I decided not to install fqcebook, drippler, twitter, or anything else that provides updates throughout the day. Those things are more of a distraction, anyway.<br />
<br />
Today, I did everything that I normally do, keeping 4G and Bluetooth ip, streaming podcasts from 7 am until 5pm.<br />
<br />
Before the reset, I would get to about 2 pm when I would have about 20% battery left. I would head back to the shop, plug in, and find something to do in there for about an hour while I waited for battery to build back up. I'm no fan of driving home with less than 30% on my phone, so I would usually wait until my phone was back up to about 60% before taking off to finish the rest of the day by 3pm. I would get, perhaps, 15 various jibber  jabber updates throughout the workday and all of this.<br />
<br />
by 2 pm today, I was at 67%. I had fielded about 5 more phone calls than I typically would in a single day as well. All in all, I didn't even have to plug in for a recharge st all. <br />
<br />
When I left at 5pm, I still had almost 40% battery life, and without even plugging in until npw, 9pm, I'm at just under 30%.<br />
<br />
I don't need Facebook on my phone. Twitter is unnecessary. I had a handful of quips from my meandering mind that I might otherwise have felt it necessary to unleash upon the plethora of pals who occasionally see my ramblings throughout the day, but at the end of it, the only person I really am entertaining is myself, just looking for that small little bit of social acceptance.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of great apps available. Some of the games can be quite entertaining and fun. My time card program is very convenient, as the weekends I am on call, I don't have to worry about writing anything down ; it keeps track of my hours and mileage for me. <br />
<br />
But it is the number of updates that get shoved down the update stream that bother the shot out of me. The spam emails to Gmail, yeah, I just don't have time to make additional labels. I don't need facebook, I don't need twitter. Even Pandora I will not install again, because that same thing is constantly trying to get me to subscribe and choose one of the stations it thinks I might like while I'm not even using the app. <br />
<br />
Yes. This could go in rants, but I was more interested in what others with android have been doing to extend their battery life of their phones.</div>
