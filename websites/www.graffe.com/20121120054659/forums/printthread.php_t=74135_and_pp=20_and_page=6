</div>Not especially, no. It's all relative, though. I tend to think of John Gruber and MG Siegler when I think of fawning. If you want some anti-Apple rabidness, there's always the entire BGR staff and/or the likes of Dan Lyons or John Dvorack.</blockquote>

</div>See Schez, the folks I was having the conversation with in this thread - they knew to what I referred. This may come as a shock to you, but the world does not revolve around you, and we weren't put here for your edification. Now, if you are ignorant of All Things D, Kara or Walt we grownups like to do this thing called <i>asking questions</i> - maybe you should try it.</blockquote>

			<div class="message">Your objection is wrong. Your classification is an opinion, and that's a fact.</div>
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I object to your objecting to my objection.  When it is demonstrable true that CNN frequently is more akin to yellow journalism than quality reporting that a top notch news corp. should strive for, then it is no longer merely an opinion.  Also, I do not see why you are adamant in claiming CNN has quality reporting when much better reporting is accessible.  Access to primary sources is readily achievable as more documents are made simultaneously available online. <br />
<br />
Regarding Ninetoes' comment, there is a significant difference between an apologist and someone who buys some Apple products.  Since, I have not been lockstep in supporting Apple either through their products or decisions we can conclude that your premise is invalid and thus the conclusion is not sound.  As you have slandered my character I will accept a written apology or a gentleman's duel.</blockquote>

</div>Do I need to use small words? Perhaps multiple syllables is what's confusing you. <br />
<br />
MI had the contention that because of media outlets such as All Things D that Apple had no need of CNN. I therein stated that because Walt and Kara are well known Apple Apologists and that All Things D is a Apple house organ that the company (Apple) did in fact need places like CNN as it is a legitimate media outlet that (beyond MI) is respected as a source of news. <br />
<br />
That clear up what caused your quandary?</blockquote>

</div>No, you simply need to try and make sense. Which is generally easier to do without the vitriol.<br />

			MI had the contention that because of media outlets such as All Things D that Apple had no need of CNN. I therein stated that because Walt and Kara are well known Apple Apologists and that All Things D is a Apple house organ that the company (Apple) did in fact need places like CNN as it is a legitimate media outlet that (beyond MI) is respected as a source of news. <br />
<br />
That clear up what caused your quandary?

</div>Yes, thank you. That actually makes sense, and is not how I had interpreted what you wrote earlier.</blockquote>
