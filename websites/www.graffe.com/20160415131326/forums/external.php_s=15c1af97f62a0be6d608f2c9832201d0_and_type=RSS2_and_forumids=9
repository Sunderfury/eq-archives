			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I FUCKING GET IT, When making outlook rules, it's easy to loop yourself into stuff if you don't know what the fuck you're doing.<br />
<br />
But I want a registry key to turn off this default option on MY USER INSTANCE OF OUTLOOK ON MY MACHINE.<br />
<br />
I only have a handful of rules but as a sysadmin, this REALLY defeats some GREAT options that outlook can provide and I could TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO USE IT PROPERLY!<br />
<br />
This particular &quot;stop processing all rules&quot; means that once a SINGLE rule is processed on an e-mail message, NO OTHER RULES ARE PROCESSED <b>ON THAT SAME MESSAGE</b>.<br />
<br />
For example, since local (in an outlook instance, not on the exchange farm) rules only run when an outlook client is online, I COULD (and can) construct a rule chain that does the following:<br />
<br />
Email comes in with a subject bearing the word &quot;OUTAGE&quot; and based on my rule it forwards all of those to a folder, based on that first step alone.<br />
<br />
Now this folder has SUB-FOLDERS.<br />
<br />
Let's call them:<br />
<br />
SERVICE<br />
<br />
SOFTWARE<br />
<br />
NETWORKING<br />
<br />
LOCALE<br />
<br />
Note how big this tree is getting.<br />
<br />
So now I want to set additional rules for things that go into OUTAGES, based on what they say.<br />
<br />
By default, you can't say &quot;If an e-mail got put in the outages folder, now process this next rule based on the subject line as to whether it's software, networking, locale, etc. (because there are requirements for subject lines in announcements where I work.)<br />
<br />
No no NO, you vapid feature-free outlook developing motherfucking deuce bigolowlowlowlowlowlow trolling software engineers. Richard Kuil still weeps in his grave over the late popularity of his language-free song and I now imagine you were humming it while you made this an un-alterable default.<br />
<br />
I can find no /adminfile *.msp option, no registry hack, no powershell command (although I got a ton of junk results on that, so I didn't turn up much), I doubt I could even make an autohotkey script work, but not even HEY SCRIPTING GUY has this as a topic.<br />
<br />
That really tells you something about how this option is as ingrained, melded, and defaulted as the roller under the bed in such a way that it resonates with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_%28The_X-Files%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><b><font color="#EE82EE"> -&gt;this&lt;- </font></b></a> .<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now let's escalate this to somewhere where you work for an ISP and get THOUSANDS of e-mails a day.<br />
<br />
Why would anyone want to be able to categorize them from one folder to another, per message, in order to be up to date on issues that anyone has or has not handled?<br />
<br />
Gee, I can't imagine!<br />
<br />
UPDATE?<br />
<br />
ESCALATION?<br />
<br />
RESOLVED?<br />
<br />
ANNOUNCEMENT?<br />
<br />
ROOT CAUSE?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
There is no ability to make a workflow there WITHOUT UNCHECKING THE STOP PROCESSING RULES BOX ON EVERY SINGLE RULE ON EVERY SINGLE PERSON'S EMAIL CLIENT IN THE INFORMATION CHAIN, COMPANY FUCKING WIDE.<br />
<br />
And these rancid, rutting, meeting-happy defenders-of-self-to-the-board wonder why we have such horrible fucking communication between 5 ticketing systems, <u>no ability to see the ticketing systems of the other teams</u>, and as a result, spam e-mails constantly that NOONE FUCKING READS BECAUSE EVERYONE JUST STICKS THEIR NOSES IN THEIR OWN SILOS ONE ONE TINY FUCKING FEATURE DEFAULT AND SOME EDUCATION WOULD WORK FOR THOSE THAT NEEDED IT.<br />
<br />
I Rarely say fuck microsoft software development, because I'm a HUGE fan in general but after three days of having an on-site with a microsoft field engineer occasionally say &quot;yeah, noone can explain that to me, despite my 8 years of experience with this software, but I can dig into it if you want to.&quot; I can confidently say that, on occasion, my true feeling is:<br />
<br />
FUCK MICROSOFT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.</div>
