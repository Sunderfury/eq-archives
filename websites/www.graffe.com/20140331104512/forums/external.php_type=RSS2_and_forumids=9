			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>This one is for the books. I guess I'll start with this:<br />
<br />
Between Lowe's and Home Depot (and I'll even put in Harbor Freight for the sake of argument), I get more satisfaction out of anything I purchase from there than just about any of its competitors. I can go in and simply say, &quot;Toe Grills, HVAC&quot; and they say, &quot;End of Aisle 15.&quot; <br />
<br />
Well, I had the worst experience Thursday (Last) Night, and ended up writing an e-mail about it.: <br />
<br />
<div class="bbcode_container">
	<div class="bbcode_description">Quote:</div>
	<div class="bbcode_quote printable">
		<hr />
		
			: I had the absolute worst customer experience today in the Tool<br />
Rental/Repair department.<br />
<br />
I brought my Ridgid LSA 18v Battery and charger in to get looked at. It<br />
was coming up as &quot;Defective&quot; in its charging base.<br />
<br />
When I walked into the Tool Rental/Repair Department, I noticed there<br />
was one customer ahead of me who was having a problem with a tool<br />
rental.<br />
<br />
I stood there for 40 minutes while the cashier called for a &quot;Code<br />
Orange&quot; or &quot;Orange Alert&quot; to Tool Rental 3, perhaps 4, maybe even 5<br />
times. No one ever came.<br />
<br />
She then contacted the store ASM - His name was David. It sounded as<br />
though he would be over  there as soon as he was doing whatever it was<br />
that he was doing.<br />
<br />
The associate (Her name was Tiffany) continued to try and assist this<br />
customer. Then another associate came around (I believe her name was<br />
Athena). Then a man (whose name I did not see on  a tag), he seemed a<br />
bit exasperated himself, he was dressed in all black and no<br />
identification of a Home Depot uniform at all) arrived. They all<br />
attempted to assist Tiffany, but not one person engaged the two<br />
customers ahead of me, nor myself.<br />
<br />
They all llooked at me. THey all observed I was falling asleep on the<br />
Makita 2&quot; Rotary Hammer, they just didn't ask what I was there for, with<br />
my Ridgid battery and charger in hand.<br />
<br />
Tiffany at one point said, &quot;He's gotta be here for LSA.&quot; to which I<br />
finally said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Athena eventually left the scene after about 5 minutes, to no avail, nor<br />
to return again, after bidding herself adieu and saying, &quot;Gotta love<br />
computers.&quot; The gentleman in black literally vanished. I don't know<br />
when, exactly, he left nor how. Eventually David, the ASM arrived and<br />
without making a single bit of eye contact with any customer in line,<br />
nor observing audibly, nor olfaction or other sense, looked things over<br />
with Tiffany, said it was OK, and then dismissed himself. He didn't even<br />
observe there were customers in line.<br />
<br />
At this point, I knew there was something seriously wrong in the retail<br />
machinery to know that it was not just Tiffany who was undertrained for<br />
this department.<br />
<br />
After making a resolution, which wasn't a resolution, as she and the<br />
customer being worked on decided to have a go at it tomorrow, the couple<br />
in front of me was quickly taken care of, and then it was my turn.<br />
<br />
Mind you, 50 minutes transpired and still not a single associate has<br />
arrived in the Tool Rental/Repair department to engage the &quot;Code<br />
Orange/Alert.&quot; Good thing someone's hand didn't get caught in a Tiller,<br />
I'd hate to see how long it would take for someone to figure out how to<br />
dial 911.<br />
<br />
So, with me finally being dealt with, Tiffany called someone for<br />
assistance who walked her through the new process of how to get into the<br />
Ridgid LSA information screen.<br />
<br />
I just got done picking up my RIDGID drill for service with Gabriel the<br />
week before, so I figured this part should go by quickly.<br />
<br />
While trying to &quot;click on the big E&quot; (Internet Explorer) Tiffany kept<br />
becoming obfuscated that the process of getting to the warranty website<br />
wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
She tried several times, and it wouldn't work. She exasperatedly said,<br />
&quot;I'm going to try on this computer.&quot; She went to another computer and I<br />
could see she was getting into Internet Explorer, but instead of opening<br />
the website through the URL Input Field, she was inputting it in the<br />
HomeDepot.Com Website Product Search Bar.<br />
<br />
I instructed her how to use Ctrl+O to open a dialog for a URL to be<br />
entered. After 15 minutes of additional waiting, this FINALLY got us to<br />
the place we needed to be - only it didn't.<br />
<br />
This website needed my customer number. A number whose records was<br />
nowhere retained anywhere. There was no paperwork anywhere that she<br />
could find. She tried calling Gabriel who said he didn't ahve that<br />
information anymore.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is neither Home Depot's fault, nor her fault, nor<br />
Gabriel's. Perhaps the associates who came in to help Tiffany could<br />
instead had asked the people in line what they could do for them.<br />
<br />
Perhaps some associates could have come to assist in the Orange Alert?<br />
<br />
Perhaps everyone coudl have been trained to assist in the situation<br />
more?<br />
<br />
Regardless, I asked Tiffany what I would need to do after I got the<br />
Customer # from Ridgid - without an answer to apply a resolve to, she<br />
said she didn't know. She said she wasn't sure if she had to take the<br />
battery and send it off, or if they just sent a new one.<br />
<br />
Great. So in the ultimate end-all resolve, I wasted 1 hour and 30<br />
minutes for absolutely nothing. I'm still going to have to call RIDGID<br />
tomorrow during normal business hours in order to get my customer<br />
number, just so that I can bring it back in and wait for a resolution<br />
someone might not have at that very moment.<br />
<br />
Things to fix. BIG Things to fix. BIG.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>So, I called RIDGID this morning. My phone ran out of juice yesterday, and I dropped it off at home and put it on the charger before heading over to Home Depot. I ran in, thinking it would be quick - why would I need my phone? Well, had I my phone on me, I coudl have logged into either my google drive, or gmail and found my product registration confirmation from RIDGID, and gotten it all resolved right then and there - only I didn't have my phone, and the associate who let me use her computer had a firewall against google. Fuckin' Great. SO that lead me to the situation above. <br />
<br />
<br />
RIDGID had my customer information for me in less than 6 minutes - seriously. After dialing their 800 number, getting transferred to a sweet lil' thang from Ohio, she said I dialed into the wrong department, but had me to a guy with a real nice voice who got me my # from start of phone call to finish in 6 minutes.  That was at 9:45. <br />
<br />
At about 11AM, I got a phone call from Home Depot Corporate Office in Alabama, who said that they were working on my case, and they would get back to me with a resolution. Then I got an e-mail from the same lady who called me, saying exactly the same thing. Mind you, I never really knew what all I had written to Home Depot on their feedback form, because it is so small, did not have a scroller, so I just sort of let it all out. That spiel up there in quotes if First Draft, no rewrites. Personally, I'm sort of impressed with myself. It never has been that easy writing anything the first time (I'll probably rewrite this about 3 times before hitting &quot;Submit Thread.&quot; ) The e-mail sent to me from the Corporate office contained, also, my original feedback -- that spiel above. It was the first time I'd really known what I wrote, and I was sort of nervous about all the name dropping I made. <br />
<br />
Seriously, I used to spend about 10 hours a month in this store before I got transferred. People knew me, and in the last 6 months, alot of employees have changed up, and the day crew (whom I was familiar with) has been replaced with the night crew for my visits, and those are only about once every 2 months. I was very concerned I might be doing others a disservice between they and their employer. <br />
<br />
So, at about 1pm, I get a phone call from The Home Depot around the corner from my house (Oi, I didn't even realize I put in enough information for them to figure out which Home Depot it was). Its the Store's General Manager, he's got me on speaker phone, and he's hearing my account. I know he's doing this with every afflicted party listening - I mean, thats what I would do. <br />
<br />
So I explain everything, and I stress how Tiffany was really trying, REALLY trying to do this, and I was walking her through everything I knew, and she was REALLY trying. <br />
<br />
<br />
I was at work, underground, amazed I even had a signal on my cell phone, but somehow I managed to get some of what he said back into my earpiece; something along the lines of, please head back into the store, we will resolve this, we want you as a customer, we handle 30,000 transactions every single day, and we want every single one of them to be absolutely perfect. SOmetimes this happens, and the fact you wrote an e-mail means everything, you name it, he said it. Followed by something along the lines of &quot;We can do some markdowns, and I'll give you $40 in store credit, and we can go from there.&quot; <br />
<br />
So, after a long day of work, I get to The Home Depot at 6pm, right, exactly, as I said I would be. He told me to go in, ask for David, the Asisstant Store Manager, and he'll make sure everything is resolved. <br />
<br />
In my mind, I wondered if I should just take my battery over to tool repair, get it resolved over there first, and then ask for David. THen, I thought maybe I could go talk to David first, and have his resolution, then it won't feel as awkward while I go to Tool Repair and have them handle the tool thing, and it'll be easy, because its during normal hours,a nd the store manager will be prepped to handle the repair, and everything will be good -- and yeah. Thats how I was thinking. Very circular. Very nervous. Not like myself at all. <br />
<br />
I finally decided to just act like I wasn't even there to see the store manager David. Just to handle as its own transaction. What are the chances that Lightning would strike twice? &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
100% !!! THAT'S WHAT THE CHANCES ARE!!!!! <br />
<br />
SO I go in today, I go to tool rental. First thing from the guy at the desk, &quot;I'm sorry, I'm new here, so I don't know how to do that. You'll have to wait for Tom.&quot; <br />
<br />
So I sit and wait for 15 minutes for Tom to show up. &quot;Oh, I'm sorry, I don't handle that stuff. You're going to have to come back when Gabriel is here tomorrow, and handle it then.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
I was so pissed off, I wanted to pee on the floor. But I don't show that. I had dinner plans with my wife, so I didn't want to get angry. I just wanted to make sure this got handled right. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well, I got a phone call from Steve earlier today, and he told me to come in today at exactly 6pm, and that David the ASM would know how to handle this. Thats all I'm here for, is David.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom: &quot;Well, I don't know what David is going to do about it. he doesn't handle these machines, so he's not going to know how to handle this at all. YOu'd be better off waiting until tomorrow and coming in and seeing Gabriel.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I was on the phone with RIDGID this morning, and they helped me out with my customer ID #, and they e-mailed me the entire process on how to get this taken care of, and I can walk you through it, because I've got my phone, and my e-mail has all the info. Steve called me, somehow he got wind of this whole fiasco, and he personally requested that I come in, and ask for David in order to get this resolved.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom: &quot;Well, lets go ahead and walk through the whole process. I can do that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, [walked him through the whole process leading up to Store Login @ the Warranty LSA website] now your login is H1303, and your password is the same one that you use for all your online transactions that they trained you on.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom: &quot;Well, I'm going to have to find a manual for that.&quot; (goes rifling through manuals.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, just type in H1303, and just enter your password for the store.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom: &quot;Well, I've got to make sure this is right, because I've never done this before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, well, then I suggest you call for David and ask for him to come over here. Steve asked for me to come in and ask for him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom: &quot;Well, if you think he's going to know what to do, then that's fine with me. I'll give him a call&quot;<br />
<br />
He picks up the phone and calls David. I have bad hearing, so all I hear is David's name a couple times. <br />
<br />
Customer to the left of me sees my RIDGID battery on the counter and  asks me if it is defective. I say yes. He says he's got 2 that are defective. I ask him if he's taken them in for the LSA. He says that it isn't his job to deal with that, it is his accountants. Oi, Gevalt. He's in for a rude awakening. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tom turns back to me and says david will arrive shortly. I take a chill-ax break on my previously used Makita 2&quot; Rotary hammer. <br />
<br />
David shows up, shakes my hand, and says that he's going to get me a brand new battery and some money in store credit. he walks me over to the battery corral, and my battery isn't there. There are other Ridgid 18v Batteries, but not the one the same as mine - there are batteries way better than mine, but not thes ame as mine. Plus, I'm a little nervous, because this still doesn't truly resolve my issue of my battery, which has to follow RIDGID's procedures to retain its Lifetime Service Agreement warranty. <br />
<br />
So, he pulls out the most expensive battery on the shelf. A compact, 4x Life, 2.0 amp 18v battery - this is like my existing battery, but on steroids, methamphetamine, and wrapped in velvet vagina flesh. With Tits. Yes, its that fucking good. <br />
<br />
Then he tells me he'll meet me at the front counter, and to go through the store and get whatever it is that I need. he asks if $40 is adequate, and I'm stunned. I just got a rim job, a handjob, and now he's asking if I want him to swallow. Come again? At this point, I really only wanted to have the LSA procedure honored, but it felt like everytime I tried segueing into that, saying things like, &quot;I didn't want anyone to get in trouble,&quot; or &quot;At the end of the day&quot; and he cuts me off each time, saying I deserve everything I&quot;m getting today.<br />
<br />
So I say, &quot;well, I was planning on painting a house tomorrow, so I just need to get a paintbrush and a scraper (i have all this, and my brain is sort of numb, so I think if I dismiss myself, I might be okay.&quot; <br />
<br />
So I grab a  paintbrush - i really needed to get a bucket head, and that was the secondary reason I went in, but my brain has become so numb that i completely forgot - a scraper, and a hand bucket and hand trays. <br />
<br />
I make my way over to the checkout, and there's David, standing at the Front counter with a knockout Aztlanian Princess in front of him with the battery at her side. I'm stunned. I really, at this point am speechless. He's got the battery out of its packaging (I assume so I can't return it for cash?), and she's ringing me up for everything and marking it all down to 0. She bags it all up, and tells me to have a nice day. <br />
<br />
Fuck. I still didn't get it resolved. Should I still go back tomorrow and have Gabriel run the LSA on my battery? Do I call RIDGID and ask for them to transfer my warranty from the defective battery over to this new better battery? Hell, will they even honor this? <br />
<br />
In the end, I didn't even get what I came there for resolved in the first place! FUCK! FUUUCK!!<br />
<br />
SO, after my wife and I go out for dinner, I make a list of the stuff I actually needed to get there for painting tomorrow, as well as my new Buckethead. I walk in, I pick up everything I actually needed and proceeded to the back checkout near the ProDesk (I didn't want to run into anyone from before). Lo and behold, who makes their way from the back right past me? Fucking David, the ASM. <br />
<br />
What does he do? He tells the cashier to mark evrything down I was purchasing to 0, and that it was to complete the full $40 (which it was going to be almost $60 in stuff) which 'he owed me' from prior. <br />
<br />
FUCK. What the Fuck. Do I call and complain that I didn't want this? I feel like CHristian Bale in AMerican Hustle, &quot;NO no no, No no no, I can't take your money.&quot;  &quot;TAKE MY MONEY.&quot;</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>So, I occasionally check out random blogcastvidshows here and there. I might go surfing through the tunnels of youtube and end up somewhere interesting. Sometimes i don't, and most times it ends in a tutorial of how to surgically transform a penis into a vagina. <br />
<br />
Oh, c'est l'vie. <br />
<br />
However, on one such occasion, tonight, I might have made my way over to the Greg Miller show on youtube - LONG sitdown show, most episodes are over 10 minutes, and the one I bring up is over an hour and a half long. <br />
<br />

<iframe class="restrain" title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/69pmUwUfPKE?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0"  allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen  mozallowfullscreen ></iframe>
<br />
<br />
Turns out, the producer of this show, the guy on the right, is a guy I went to high school with. I knew him quite well, actually, and we both played in the high school band. <br />
<br />
What cracks me up, is this guy was THICK in school. Very wonderful person to be around, charismatic and christ himself, but THICK. Now he's a skinny greek looking guy. <br />
<br />
What is even funnier is he goes onto how he has recently started using reddit, and they all admit their handles on the service. &quot;Power Paizano&quot; is the fellow on the far right. Made me fall over laughing, because I used to always call him Paizano out of respect, but he always thought i was insulting him, not knowing that it was a term of mutual humility. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, it's a rant. And that's why it is here.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I do. <br />
<br />
It started out every time I did it. Then I began to realize it was a bad idea to start. I'd wait a week and think I could try it again, but I'd end up in the same place, bent over the toilet bowl, praying to god, asking why. I hadn't touched the stuff in 3 months this last bout, but then on my lunch break, I was seduced back into it, almost by saying, &quot;One won't hurt.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
I'm talking about spicy food.<br />
<br />
I used to eat the stuff all the time. Spicy food was my favorite high. Whether from eating chili peppers whole, while munching down fries and a cheeseburger, or buffalo wings, jalapeño pizza, and tandoori chicken - you name it - i'd eat it, and it made me feel <i>great.</i><br />
<br />
I didn't start getting &quot;the burns&quot; until about 6 years ago. Now, i get them whenever i eat anything remotely spicy. I've almost completely removed spice of any kind from my diet. I'll occasionally slip something in that is mild once a week here, and once a week there. <br />
<br />
Today, I saw the most beautiful, delicious looking yellow chili peppers in brine at my favorite lunch spot, and put 3 in a little plastic take-away container, and scarfed them down while i ate a cheeseburger. <br />
<br />
I honestly thought that I would be A-OK. I love spicy food endorphine rush. It makes my day fucking GREAT. Spicy food, is DELICIOUS. <br />
<br />
But as soon as I got home from work, my stomach was already talking. I had to do all my after-work chores and activities before finally making dinner tongiht, and after I did, I spend 3 sessions at the toilet, just letting it all come out. Squeezing my tummy down through some logical navigation of my bowels. &quot;Get the fuck out. Just get the fuck out. Just get the fuck out. Just get the fuck out. fuck you. fuck fuck fuck. get the fuck out of my asshole. just get out.&quot; <br />
<br />
Each time I was done, I knew I wasn't, and each time I wasn't, I caught myself saying, &quot;never again, please god, never again, pleeeeeeeeeease.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Its not a bleeding anus, but a fiery one isn't much better, either.</div>
