			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>September doesn't have as many releases as August did, but it has it has one of the biggest hitters of the year to make up for it.<br />
<br />
That's right, the big game this month is <b>Grand Theft Auto V</b>, and the hype train is in full swing. And while I do think people are overhyping it, I also think it's probably going to be a great game. Better combat, a bigger world, three characters, etc etc. Even the multiplayer sounds very well thought out. It unlocks two weeks after launch to give everyone a chance to play through the main game first (a smart idea in my opinion). You create a character, join a guild, play missions with friends, or just screw around. They claim the world is persistent for 16 players but haven't gone into specifics. <br />
<br />
After GTA5, the biggest release might be <b>Total War: Rome II</b> for you PC guys. I haven't really seen anyone talking about it, but the series has a good pedigree. <br />
<br />
If you own a Wii U but no games for it, <b>The Wonderful 101</b> comes out this month (it's already out in Europe I believe). Platinum games make the best games that no one buys, give it a shot if you have a Wii U. Sort of an action oriented Pikmin style game. Supposed to be fairly challenging. While it's supposedly good on any platform, <b>Rayman Legends</b> is also due this month, and makes better use of the Wii U's tablet than many Nintendo games.<br />
<br />
If it's Sony games you are after, the Vita gets <b>Killzone: Mercenary</b>, and the PS3 gets a $40 budget platformer by the name of <b>Puppeteer</b> which has gotten a fair amount of positive attention. I think it would be amazing if $40 became the standard for all games of the last generation from this point forward. The PS3 port of KH: Final Mix (a Japanese only re-release of the first game) <b>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix</b> is also only $40 this month.<br />
<br />
Finally, while I don't really expect anyone here to care, <b>Diablo III</b> is set to make its console debut and a HD remake of Mickey Mouse's <b>Castle of Illusion</b> is also set to be released this month.<br />
<br />

<br />
It's in beta right now, no NDA on anyone, at some point in the future it'll enter open beta where anyone who wants in can get in. I'm hoping to get in the next wave of invites on Tuesday, because I loved playing Magic back in the day and the game does look interesting. Mostly, I want to see if one can play the game without a significant outlay of cash for cards. There seems to be mechanics to allow for it (&quot;daily quests&quot; that award gold, which can be used to buy cards; the Arena, a pack draft environment that gives out big prizes; you can disenchant cards and create cards with the resulting dust), but it's a question of how far those mechanics go. If I could play and enjoy myself without paying more than a standard MMO sub price per month, I think I'd get the game.<br />
<br />
So has anyone else been following the game at all?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>EA and Humble Bundle have a bundle of EA games. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.humblebundle.com/</a> All of the proceeds not given to Humble Bundle are split up among five charities: Human Rights Campaign, watsi, American Cancer Society, American Red Cross, San Francisco AIDS Foundation. I believe this has been the fastest selling Humble Bundle yet. Seen a fair amount of people gloating about giving a dollar to charity for games they will pretend to not like. The way people seek approval from others over the internet by being intensely negative is really starting to bug me.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here are the games currently available as part of the bundle: You get keys for Origin, and keys for Steam (for the older titles).<br />
<br />
Dead Space 1 <br />
Dead Space 3 (yeah, they skipped 2) <br />
Crysis 2<br />
Mirror's Edge<br />
Medal of Honor<br />
Burnout Paradise: Ultimate<br />
<br />
If you spend more than the average (currently $4.80 or so), you also get:<br />
<br />
Battlefield 3<br />
Sims 3<br />
<br />
There are rumors more games will be added at the halfway point, Dead Space 2 seems a given. Bulletstorm has been suggested. I secretly hope for Crysis 3 but don't expect it.<br />
<br />
I've already got most of these games, but went ahead and donated for Mirror's Edge. It's a decent bundle, good games but not their best games. But since it's illegal to mention EA on the internet without griping about them, I will point out that both Battlefield 3 and the Sims 3 have a freak load of DLC that they no doubt hope people will feel compelled to buy once trying the games. This is also obviously a fairly easy way to get more people on Origin.<br />
<br />
If you are curious and/or tempted, here are my opinions on each of the games in the bundle: Games in parentheses are not confirmed.<br />
<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px"><b>Spoiler</b> for <i>impressions</i>: <input type="button" value="Show" style="width:45px;font-size:10px;margin:0px;padding:0px;" onClick="if (this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display != 'inline') { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'inline'; this.value = 'Hide'; } else { this.parentNode.parentNode.getElementsByTagName('div')[1].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].style.display = 'none';  this.value = 'Show'; }">
</div>
<div class="alt2" style="margin: 0px; padding: 6px; border: 1px inset;">
<div style="display: none;">
<br />
Dead Space 1 - Space survival horror, very tense atmosphere. Feels a bit unpolished at times, and can be annoying, but the things it does well are never topped by the sequels.<br />
(Dead Space 2) - A bit more of an action game than the first one, but the formula isn't ruined nearly as much as it was in the Resident Evil games. My least favorite in the series.<br />
Dead Space 3 - Takes what they started with 2 and perfects it. 1 does atmosphere better, 3 does everything else better. Neither the DLC nor the co-op ruin the game.<br />
<br />
Crysis 2 - Plays more like a FEAR game than Crysis 1. If you can get over this, the gunplay and suit powers are better, but the game in general is mediocre. Fun combat, bleh everything else.<br />
Battlefield 3 - I liked the previous games more, but it still has a few things going for it.<br />
(Bulletstorm) - Probably my favorite game on this list. It's a dumb action shooter with cool combo mechanics. Shoot guys, kick guys, use a lasso to fling guys around. It's great.<br />
<br />
Medal of Honor - Haven't played. Heard it's just a mediocre CoD clone. Campaign is 4 hours long, which is actually perfect for me when allowed to choose my own price. An appetizer is all I want.<br />
Mirror's Edge - Haven't played. Unique idea hampered by a few annoying design decisions.<br />
Burnout - Haven't played. Supposed to be a pretty good open world racer.<br />
Sims 3 - Haven't played. Doesn't need an explanation anyway. Do you want to watch cartoon people use the toilet? Then this game is for you!<br />
<br />
 
</div>
</div>
</div><br />
<br />
<br />
In somewhat related news, EA has a new policy where if you buy a game on the Origin store, you have within seven days of purchase, or within 24 hours of activating and playing a game, to return it for a refund. The stated purpose is to let people return games that don't run on their system. Too bad that policy wasn't in place for SimCity huh? :p I have already seen some poor fools talking about beating a game in 24 hours and then returning it for a refund. I predict more bitching and moaning to come when EA notices this and refuses the refund. Thinking about anything other than how to cheat a system is apparently hard.</div>

<br />
I gave GFWL the benefit of the doubt for awhile, but even I am fed up with it by this point. Microsoft gave up on PCs years ago, and it's about time they stop making us suffer just to they could pretend to care.<br />
<br />
I just hope the games that currently use it can have it patched out. Seeing as how you have to go through an awkward log-in process just to play most of them, it would suck for them to simply become unplayable.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Gamescon has always seemed a little more PC centric to me, but this year both Microsoft and Sony have a presence as they build up towards their new console launches. I figure we could use a new thread for anything new announced. Feel free to post anything interesting from Gamescon that doesn't involve them as well, but most publishers seem to just rehash old material so I'm not expecting much.<br />
<br />
Sony has a conference later today that I believe will be streamed. I'm expecting at least one new exclusive, and probably some new info on stuff like The Order. <br />
<br />
Microsoft's thing is going on now, but they decided not to stream it, so news is just coming in bits and pieces. A lot of their stuff was also leaked ahead of time, like Microsoft turning the console itself into a dev kit and allowing indie's to self publish.<br />
<br />
So far all I've heard is that they are making a new Fable (surprise surprise) with 4 player co-op, and that FIFA will be included in all European pre-orders.</div>
