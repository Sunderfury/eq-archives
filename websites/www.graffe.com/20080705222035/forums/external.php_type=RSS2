			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The suggestion has been made by a number of people reporting Nadiar and Wandor's sigs that the font size used renders them NSFW images.<br />
<br />
I think it's clear that they are NSFW.<br />
<br />
The only question is whether they should be deemed images.<br />
<br />
Since there seems at this point to be no progress to be made through conversation, and I know that on Monday most people will be again at work, I am proposing to treat them as images due to their size.<br />
<br />
If this interpretation is supported then the sigs will be removed but no warnings will be given due to the interpretation issues, and the rule will be re-written to make this explicit for the next revision in August.<br />
<br />
Incidentally I think it would be healthier if prompts for rules decisions were coming from the board rather than me, but apparently we are not at a point where people are ready to work with the mod team in this way yet. Culture changes take time.<br />
<br />
If you object to this interpretation, please speak now.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I feel should post this because it is easy to mistake my sig for something I did not intend. Let me make it perfectly clear that I couldn't care less about NSFW sigs. The rule is fine as it is, I really don't want any more rules. I am all for giving the mods plenty of leash to get things done.<br />
<br />
The point of my sig is to illustrate how ridiculous it is to claim that a barely questionable cartoon sig that shows up once per thread is somehow damaging to Dmitry's children when he himself uses language that would make a sailor blush. In the same thread no less.<br />
<br />
Reporting Dmitry is a waste of time. First I am told that no one is willing to do anything about him because of the shit storm it will cause. Then I am told that that response was not official. So what got done? Nothing.<br />
<br />
This week Dmitry decides to pick on Daph for what ever reason. Is her sig NSFW? I don't think so, but I figure the mods can make that decision. Instead of just reporting her sig he starts a thread on it calling her out. Now we have yet another dramafest for Dmitry's amusement.<br />
<br />
What got done? Well, I guess he did get top billing in the wrist slap report. When he gets tire of this, he'll just go after someone else. Who's next?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Despite the fact that Graffe's has its roots in gaming, the &quot;Other Games&quot; forum has always been a bit of a red-headed step child.<br />
<br />
These are the changes I propose to more clearly define its purpose and status:<br />
<br />
- Rename the forum. I believe &quot;Other Games&quot; actually turns people away from the forum. &quot;Gaming Discussion&quot;, &quot;General Gaming&quot; or even just &quot;Gaming&quot; would be more appropriate.<br />
<br />
- Move the forum to the top of the &quot;Gaming&quot; category. &quot;Other Games&quot; (whatever its final name) should be the first option for gaming-related posts rather than the current &quot;last resort&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Move gaming-related posts from the General Discussion (OT) to &quot;Other Games&quot; unless the post is cross-topic (e.g. a gaming/politics hybrid like the Jack Thompson threads). A good example for this is the Diablo III thread. What's that thread doing in General Discussion when it's all about gaming? The only reason it's posted there is because there's the justified belief that &quot;Other Games&quot; is a dead end (see above).</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Posters who feel unhappy with an aspect of the current rule set may wish to avail themselves of a simple procedure open to any member of the board.<br />
<br />
Simply start a post in the Site and Forum Administration Forum with the Prefix Forum rules which either:<br />
<br />
1) Gives the new rule you wish added and the reasons why.<br />
<br />
2) Gives the reworking of the rule you wish to modify and the reasons why.<br />
<br />
3) Identifies the rule you want to remove and gives the reasons why.<br />
<br />
Your proposal will then be discussed by members of the board, and if the consensus over is in favour of the change, or some modification of the change, it will be adopted.<br />
<br />
The only constraint on this procedure is that the rules cannot be changing constantly. As an initial constraint I will be restricting changes to the rules to once per 3 months, though arguments for other time frames are welcome.<br />
<br />
However, you may start a thread at anytime and if changes are agreed upon they will be adopted at the end of the time frame.<br />
<br />
However, since this is the first tryout for the new rule set and mod policy we will make a revision with any agreed upon changes that happen in the interim on August 1st.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I'm taking it on myself to do this since the moderation team haven't elected a lead moderator yet and I think there is a certain urgency.<br />
<br />
Summary of moderation actions taken.<br />
<br />
1) Dmitry<br />
<br />
Dmitry's behaviour towards Daph was judged by all moderators who expressed an opinion on the subject to be harassment. As per the moderation policy he was asked by pm to knock it off and he complied, so no formal warning was given. Also in accord with the moderation policy that says harassing posts may be edited (but in a minimal way) her name was removed and the thread was moved to the administration forum with the hopes that this would focus the discussion on genuine issues.<br />
<br />
2) Milaru<br />
<br />
A number of you reported Milaru for his comments towards Nattik. In the absence of any civility rules beyond the minimum harassment rule his comments were not against the rules. No action was taken. If you find this unacceptable then all we can do is suggest that people take an active role when the rules are next up for revision to advocate for broader civility rules that allow for more moderator discretion in these sorts of matters.<br />
<br />
3) The sig<br />
<br />
The moderators, like the board, are divided on the issue of whether Daph's sig is safe for work or not. I have started a public poll in the moderator forum which I will move to the public admin forum once the votes are in and it is closed. (This is the only way to restrict it to moderators.) If it is not decisive one way or the other then I will make an executive decision to stand until the next time we engage in a rules discussion.<br />
<br />
4) Ofia<br />
<br />
Ofia reported numerous posts in a very short period, all of which were responses to an argument she continued to engage in. This is moderator harassment and she was asked to knock it off, which she did, so no formal warning was given.<br />
<br />
General comments:<br />
<br />
If you think a post or sig is in violation of the rules you should either report it or send a polite pm to the person in the first instance. If there is no response to a report within a 24 hour period then perhaps starting a public thread might be appropriate. Starting a public thread as your first action is not a good way to get a helpful cooperative response. If that thread is abusive then you are even less likely to get such a response.<br />
<br />
If you expect us to take a report of harassment seriously then engaging in the conversation back and forth with the purported harasser is probably not a good strategy. If you have a good faith report then make it and back off, perhaps putting the poster on ignore temporarily if you need to to be able to resist.<br />
<br />
People are also reminded that the NSFW rule was re-crafted numerous times to try and produce the least ambiguous standard we could come up with. Suggesting that we should replace it with a more ambiguous 'no pornography rule' or that we should replace with 'something objective' is not helpful. Crafting a rule that is less ambiguous is helpful and welcome.</div>
