A big question in my mind is how will this tarnish Goodell?  Personally, I think Goodell will not last much longer when you concider that the players don't respect him and the owners are going to look for a scape goat if the games get much worse.</blockquote>

			As Lynch watched Packers safety M.D. Jennings snatch the pass out of the sky and pull it to his chest while Tate, who had blatantly pushed off against Green Bay cornerback Sam Shields, belatedly latched on one arm at a time, the running back's eyes grew big and his jaw dropped low. The room was dead silent as the realization gripped Lynch and his companions: Like most of the viewing public, they now understood that the Seahawks had received an extraordinary gift from the replacement officials.<br />
 &quot;We didn't win that game,&quot; someone at the table said, and nobody made a peep to challenge him.

			Cincinnati, Ohio (CNN) &#8211; Devoted Green Bay Packers fan Rep. Paul Ryan weighed in on the stunning referee call during Monday night's Packers-Seattle Seahawks football game Tuesday. The GOP vice presidential nominee likened the replacement referees to bad calls made by President Barack Obama. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you guys watch that Packers game last night? I mean, give me a break. It is time to get the real refs,&quot; Ryan said Tuesday at a town hall in Ohio. &quot;And you know what, it reminds me of President Obama and the economy. If you can't get it right, it's time to get out.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Ryan's beloved team lost to the Seahawks 14-12 after an NFL replacement referee awarded a questionable winning touchdown to Seattle. The Republican vice presidential nominee watched the game from his hotel room in Ohio at The Cincinnatian, according to an aide.<br />
 <br />
With five seconds left in the game, Russell Wilson, starting quarterback for Seattle, threw up a 'Hail Mary' into the end zone and refs awarded Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate with the touchdown, when it appeared to many that Green Bay defender M.D. Jennings intercepted the ball.<br />
 <br />
The replacement referees are made up of officials who primarily work for Division II and Division III colleges and are being used in the professional games until a labor dispute with NFL referees gets resolved. <br />
<br />
The Wisconsin native and seven-term congressman tied the NFL firestorm to the presidential campaign. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have to think that these refs work part time for the Obama administration in the budget office. They see the national debt clock staring them in the face, they see a debt crisis and they just ignore and pretend it didn't even happen. They're trying to pick the winners and losers and they don't even do that very well,&quot; said Ryan. <br />
<br />
Outraged players, Packers fans and sports commentators turned to social media sites, namely Twitter, to express their frustration over the disputed call.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Any player/coach in Seattle that really thinks they won that game has zero integrity as man and should be embarrassed,&quot; Packers Offensive Guard T.J. Lang said on Twitter. <br />
<br />
In Ohio, Paul compared the Romney-Ryan presidential campaign to last night's game. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unlike the Seattle Seahawks last night, we want to deserve this victory. We want to earn this victory.&quot;

</div>This is the type of stuff that pisses me off. A lot of Packer fans et al are blaming the Hawks like we cheated. No, the refs fucked up and what competitor is going to say, &quot;Oh no we didn't deserve it.&quot;Fact is we handed it to the Packers for most of the game and bad calls led to points on both sides. Just so happens that the worst of the bad calls went to us.</blockquote>
