I am assuming it is not something that I should be seeing in search results. It is nothing major but from my perspective was wtf is this? <br />
<br />
It is all the spam stuff that shows up and is tagged or something like that with Group: Graffemed or something like that.<br />
<br />
See here: <a href="http://www.graffe.com/forums/search.php?searchid=187959" target="_blank">http://www.graffe.com/forums/search.php?searchid=187959</a><br />
<br />
I am guessing in the recent forum update it was unintentionally unhidden.</blockquote>

I should not be seeing the stuff inside the strokeline, right? The Group:Graffe and Group:Graffemed stuff showing up in searches seems undesired as well.</blockquote>

So what happened is I kind of hid the group functionality, because people were only using it to be abusive to others, or not understanding it at all.  But you can still create and join a group.  And new members still had the ability to create them.  I deleted the spam and those 2 posters.<br />
<br />
A bunch of them show up as moderated because they came up with a neat way to bypass the spam limit and also to prevent admins from seeing them anywhere (basically they added everyone to the group except admins).  I have a few methods of viewing those forums, but I have to know their names or at least 1 member first.</blockquote>
