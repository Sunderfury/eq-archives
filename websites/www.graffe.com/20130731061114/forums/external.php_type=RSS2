Never knew until about 6 years ago that he suffered from Cystic Fibrosis, when he started wearing his oxygen around with him everywhere. He had been a modern, classical, and ballet dancer background and was advised by his doctor a couple years ago to stop. Reluctantly, he did. But he also had a final performance requirement in order to graduate. This is the video of the performance, an interpretation of his handicap - performed with Oxygen. <br />

About 3 weeks ago he went into UCLA Medical Center to receive a lung transplant. He lived, and is recovering. I'm really hoping he gets to take the stage again, soon.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I've been making jerky with basically the same recipe since 1989.  If I remember right, it came from an old late-70s version of the recipe/camping book &quot;Roughing It Easy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Since moving in with my fiancee, I've started to take liberties with what I'm creating.<br />
<br />
The first batch I made after my fiancee gifted me a Nesco dehydrator for Christmas was that standard recipe - basically soy sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire, garlic (powder), black pepper, liquid smoke (if desired.)<br />
<br />
It came out great - but we wanted something ... more.<br />
<br />
So when I picked up almost 12 lbs of London Broil (not usually ideal or first choice jerky meat, but it had fantastic fat marbling) and we had a weekend trip with 8+ hours' driving (one way) ahead of us, I decided to improvise.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/BatlFIU.jpg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">I ended up making 5 batches of jerky(pic)</a>.  The only thing I regret at the moment is that I eyeballed everything so cannot give exact measurements.<br />
<br />
Batches 1 and 5 (hidden in the back right, the top large square Lock'n'Lock, and another below it) were different variations of the original recipe.<br />
<br />
<b>The primary batch, approximately 4 lbs' meat, was:</b><br />
<br />
Soy Sauce, brown sugar, Worcestershire, garlic and onion powder, a smidgen of paprika, and a tiny bit of wild blueberry honey.  We called this &quot;alt soy&quot; because it didn't follow the original recipe.<br />
<br />
<b>The fifth batch, around 3 lbs' meat, was:</b><br />
<br />
Soy sauce, pressed garlic, sliced garlic, brown sugar, liquid smoke, black pepper.  This was much closer to the &quot;original&quot; recipe so it's the &quot;reg soy&quot; version.<br />
<br />
The other three batches though were much more unconventional for us.<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 2 - Spicy, which used the least amount of beef, due to my not liking spicy and not wanting to waste meat on a supreme screwup</b><br />
<br />
Soy sauce, worcestershire, and equal parts Louisiana Hot Sauce, juice from a jar of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giardiniera" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mixed Vegetable Giardiniera</a>, and juice from a jar of mild sliced banana peppers, plus a heaping quarter teaspoon of fresh ground black pepper, and maybe an eigth of a teaspoon of white pepper.<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 3, which we called Sweet and Sour:</b><br />
<br />
Equal parts White Grape Juice (cheapy Wal-mart brand, oddly) and pickle juice (Mt. Olive Kosher Dill), garlic powder, onion powder, and a tiny bit of liquid smoke (just enough for color) and white pepper.<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 4, which became Sweet and Spiced:</b><br />
<br />
Low-acid low-pulp Orange Juice, a good two tablespoons wild blueberry honey, LOTS of fresh cracked black pepper, white pepper, and only a little garlic and onion powder.<br />
<br />
Each batch was left to marinate for 24-28 hours, mixed/shaken several times, then dehydrated for 6-7 hours at 160 (°F), then 6-8 hours at 120 (°F) (sleep period, then work shift).<br />
<br />
Results of the various batches (out of order for emphasis):<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 1</b> - Alt Soy - we liked the stronger soy/meaty marinade flavor of this one<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 5</b> - Reg Soy - the garlic flavor was much more pronounced due to the fresh garlic.  Definitely not something to complain about<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 4</b> - Sweet n Spiced - very good.  The orange juice gave it an unexpected silkiness that played well with the spiced aura.<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 2</b> - Spicy - it was good, but came out weaker than I expected.  I was actually able to eat it (when I can't usually handle spicy jerky) but it gives me a basis for which to craft a more spicy version for m'Lady later on.<br />
<br />
<b>Batch 3</b> - Sweet and Sour - I don't know where to start with this.  This is the &quot;unexpected success&quot; to which the thread title refers.  This jerky tastes EXACTLY like a fresh-off-the-wrapper McDonald's Hamburger.  It's so crazy good that we are forcing ourselves to reserve it and eat it only a piece at a time so as not to run out too fast!<br />
<br />
If I'm able to recreate these, I'll make sure to keep track of actual measurement amounts for posting purposes.</div>

Bradley Manning guilty of espionage in Wikileaks caseComments (645) US Army Private First Class Bradley Manning is escorted by military police as he leaves his military trial after he was found guilty of 20 charges 20 July 2013 <br />
Bradley Manning, the US Army private who leaked thousands of classified documents, has been convicted of espionage but not of aiding the enemy.<br />
<br />
Pte Manning, 25, has been convicted of 20 charges in total, including theft and computer fraud.<br />
<br />
He had admitted leaking the documents to anti-secrecy organisation Wikileaks but said he did so to spark a debate on US foreign policy.<br />
<br />
The leak is considered the largest ever of secret US government files. <br />
<br />

Analysis<br />
Jude Sheerin<br />
 <br />
BBC News, Fort Meade<br />
 <br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After a seven-week court martial, the Bradley Manning verdict was delivered in less than 10 minutes in a small courtroom with several dozen spectators. Judge Colonel Denise Lind handed down her decision in a staccato tone, count by count, before leaving. <br />
<br />
Manning was convicted of most of the charges, but in acquitting him of the most serious one, aiding the enemy, Judge Lind seems to have disagreed with the prosecution's claim that the 25-year-old soldier had leaked the material with &quot;general evil intent&quot;. <br />
<br />
The aiding the enemy charge was brought under the precedent of a Civil War-era case. In that trial, a Union Army private, Henry Vanderwater, was convicted in 1863 after leaking a command roster to a Virginia newspaper. Vanderwater got three months hard labour. Manning - who faces up to 136 years in prison - is unlikely to get off as lightly.<br />
<br />
He faces a maximum sentence of up to 136 years. His sentencing hearing is set to begin on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
In addition to multiple espionage counts, he was also found guilty of five theft charges, two computer fraud charges and multiple military infractions. <br />
<br />
Pte Manning stood and faced Judge Colonel Denise Lind as she read the decision on Tuesday. She said she would release detailed written findings at a later date.<br />
<br />
He appeared not to react during the verdict, but his defence lawyer, David Coombs, smiled faintly as the not guilty charge on aiding the enemy was read.<br />
<br />
&quot;We won the battle, now we need to go win the war,&quot; his defence lawyer, David Coombs said of the sentencing phase. &quot;Today is a good day, but Bradley is by no means out of the fire.&quot;<br />
<br />
A guilty verdict on the aiding the enemy charge could have had serious implications for people leaking documents in the future, says the BBC's North America editor, Mark Mardell.<br />
<br />
&quot;The government's pursuit of the 'aiding the enemy' charge was a serious overreach of the law, not least because there was no credible evidence of Manning's intent to harm the USA by releasing classified information to WikiLeaks,&quot; Amnesty International said in a statement.<br />
<br />
But the Democratic and Republican leaders of the US House of Representatives intelligence committee said &quot;justice has been served&quot;, in a joint statement after the ruling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Manning harmed our national security, violated the public's trust, and now stands convicted of multiple serious crimes,&quot; Chairman Mike Rogers, a Republican, and senior Democrat Dutch Ruppersberger, said.<br />
<br />
Among the items sent to Wikileaks by Pte Manning was graphic footage of an Apache helicopter attack in 2007 that killed a dozen people in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, including a Reuters photographer.<br />
<br />
Continue reading the main story <br />
The charges<br />
Guilty: Seven out of eight espionage charges, five theft charges, two computer fraud charges, five military counts of violating a lawful general regulation, one of wanton publication of intelligence on the internet<br />
<br />
Not guilty: Aiding the enemy, unauthorised possession of information relating to national defence<br />
<br />
The documents also included 470,000 Iraq and Afghanistan battlefield reports and 250,000 secure state department cables between Washington and embassies around the world.<br />
<br />
Pte Manning, an intelligence analyst, was arrested in Iraq in May 2010. He spent weeks in a cell at Camp Arifjan, a US Army installation in Kuwait, before being transferred to the US. <br />
<br />
During the court martial, prosecutors said Pte Manning systematically harvested hundreds of thousands of classified documents in order to gain notoriety. <br />
<br />
Continue reading the main story <br />
The Wikileaks disclosures<br />
At a glance: Wikileaks cables<br />
Excerpts: Iraq war logs<br />
Excerpts: Afghan war logs<br />
<br />
With his training as an intelligence analyst, Pte Manning should have known the leaked documents would become available to al-Qaeda operatives, they argued.<br />
<br />
The defence characterised him as a naive and young soldier who had become disillusioned during his time in Iraq.<br />
<br />
Widney Brown, Amnesty International: Pte Manning never had &quot;any intent to harm the US government&quot;<br />
<br />
His actions, Mr Coombs argued, were those of a whistle-blower.<br />
<br />
In a lengthy statement during a pre-trial hearing in February, Pte Manning said he had leaked the files in order to spark a public debate about US foreign policy and the military.<br />
<br />
Much of the court martial was spent considering the soldier's intentions as he leaked the documents.<br />
<br />
His supporters rallied outside the court in Fort Meade and said they were planning to march to the White House on Tuesday evening.<br />

			Eve players stage giant online space battle<br />
<br />
One of the largest video game space battles ever seen has taken place in the Eve Online game.<br />
<br />
For five hours on 28 July about 4,000 players took part in the epic battle between two of the game's biggest alliances.<br />
<br />
The two sides were fighting for control of resources within several of the game's solar systems.<br />
<br />
Time was slowed down in the virtual universe to help servers cope with the huge numbers of players and ships.<br />
<br />
The battle pitted spaceships belonging to CFC against those from the Test Alliance in a region of space known as 6VDT. It ended in victory for CFC.<br />
<br />
Eve Online is a detailed space simulation that sees players fly spaceships through thousands of virtual star systems, seeking resources they can use to prosper.<br />
<br />
The resources can be found on planets and in asteroid fields or acquired through piracy or other underhand means.<br />
<br />
Ships vary in size from small trading vessels to giant capital ships.<br />
<br />
Erlendur Thorsteinsson, one of Eve Online's developers, confirmed in a tweet that the battle was the biggest ever seen in the game.<br />
<br />
At its peak the battle involved 4,070 pilots and their ships.<br />
<br />
Game time was slowed to 10% of normal to lighten the load on servers working out who was shooting at whom.<br />
<br />
The pivotal moment in the battle took place two hours in, when CFC sent in a large fleet of capital ships - the most powerful in the game.<br />
<br />
Their arrival prompted many members of the Test Alliance to try to flee.<br />
<br />
By the end of the conflict thousands of ships are believed to have been destroyed.<br />
<br />
Their destruction has a real-world cost as the game's internal currency can be bought with real money.<br />
<br />
So far no-one has worked out the total value of the ships destroyed, but a far smaller battle earlier in 2013 laid waste to far fewer spacecraft that in total were estimated to be worth more than $15,000 (£10,000).<br />
<br />
The giant battle was the culmination of a long campaign by CFC to force the Test Alliance out of 6VDT.<br />
<br />
Some have speculated that it may be the only the first of a series of conflicts that seek to extinguish TEST.<br />
<br />
&quot;These kinds of conflicts are business as usual in Eve but this one was bigger than normal,&quot; said James Binns from the PCGamesN website.<br />
<br />
Mr Binns said several big events had made the last few weeks in Eve absorbing to watch. During that time a giant ship was hijacked and then destroyed in a carefully co-ordinated ambush and a huge in-game corporation was disbanded and its resources stolen by a spy from a rival faction.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a fascinating online world and its constant drama is nothing like any other game,&quot; he said.
			
		<hr />
	</div>
</div>I am honestly quite surprised an event in EVE got picked up by the BBC but 4000 people is likely bigger than any PVP battle in previous history in MMORPGs at least.</div>

			STORY HIGHLIGHTS<br />
<ul><li style="">Cecile Kyenge has been the target of death threats and racist antics</li><li style="">She became Italy's first black government minister in April</li><li style="">Newspaper editor says the bad economy has contributed to racial tensions</li></ul><br />
<br />
(CNN) -- Racist taunts against Italy's first black minister, Cecile Kyenge, took another ugly turn over the weekend when someone hurled bananas at her during a rally.<br />
<br />
Kyenge's appointment as Italy's minister of integration three months ago isn't sitting well with right-wing radicals whose racial slurs and antics have overshadowed her tenure.<br />
<br />
The banana incident is just the latest.<br />
<br />
It took place Friday in Cervia, where Kyenge was speaking to supporters. A man popped up out of the crowd and launched two bananas toward the podium, Kyenge spokesman Cosimo Torlo said.<br />
<br />
The bananas fell short of the stage, landing between the first and second row of spectators.<br />
<br />
Giancarlo Mazzuca, chief editor of the daily newspaper Il Giorno, was sitting two chairs away from Kyenge.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was able to verify which levels can be reached by human stupidity,&quot; he wrote in a column.<br />
<br />
Police haven't found the person who hurled the bananas. There will be increased security around the minister, Torlo said.<br />
<br />
Kyenge shrugged off the episode -- as she has with the other incidents.<br />
<br />
In a Twitter post, she called it a sad waste of food when so many people are dying of hunger.<br />
<br />
Kyenge, who was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo, moved to Italy in the 1980s to study medicine. She became an Italian citizen and is an ophthalmologist in Modena.<br />
<br />
While her ascent to a top government position reflects the success of immigrants, it also has stoked nativism.<br />
<br />
<b>Ominous mannequins</b><br />
<br />
Just before Kyenge arrived for Friday's rally, a group smeared blood-red paint and anti-immigrant messages onto mannequins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Immigration kills,&quot; read signs attached to the dummies.<br />
<br />
The far-right political group Forza Nuova (&quot;New Force&quot;) claimed responsibility for the mannequins.<br />
<br />
The scene was also littered with fliers that said Italy's future growth depends on &quot;protecting the Italian identity,&quot; according to the ANSA news agency.<br />
<br />
<b>Insults from other politicians</b><br />
<br />
Two weeks ago, Italian Sen. Roberto Calderoli likened Kyenge to an orangutan. Calderoli, a member of the anti-immigration Northern League party, made the remarks at a political rally.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love animals -- bears and wolves, as everyone knows -- but when I see the pictures of Kyenge, I cannot but think of, even if I'm not saying she is one, the features of an orangutan,&quot; he was quoted as saying.<br />
<br />
After his comments were published, Calderoli said &quot;if I've offended her, I apologize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a joke, a comment in a joking way. There was nothing particularly against her,&quot; he said. &quot;It was just my impression. ... It is all very well that she be a minister but in her own country. Given that this government needs to govern Italy, I hope that it is done by Italians.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyenge responded diplomatically, saying Calderoli &quot;does not need to ask forgiveness to me, but he should rather reflect on the political and institutional role that he carries. It is on this that he needs to make a profound reflection also to then apologize.&quot;<br />
<br />
She added, &quot;Also, he must go beyond putting everything on a personal level. I think the time has come for us to study the problem of communication.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>Death threats</b><br />
<br />
Kyenge has also received death threats before visiting an area where the Northern League is powerful.<br />
<br />
A local politician recently said on Facebook that Kyenge should be raped so she can understand the pain felt by victims of crime, which some politicians blame on immigrants.<br />
<br />
She's been called a &quot;Congolese monkey,&quot; &quot;Zulu&quot; and &quot;the black anti-Italian.&quot; One Northern League official said &quot;she seems like a great housekeeper&quot; but &quot;not a government minister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta appealed to Northern League leader Roberto Maroni to &quot;close this chapter right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
<b>Tensions over immigrants</b><br />
<br />
Italy has been experiencing its highest level of unemployment in more than 20 years.<br />
<br />
In tough times, some Italians focus their anger on immigrants, Mazzuca, the newspaper editor, told CNN.<br />
<br />
&quot;The economic crisis is worsening the situation,&quot; he said. &quot;Jobs that until a few years ago wouldn't have even been considered by Italians are now becoming precious.&quot;<br />
<br />
There have recently been more and more reports of Italians beating foreigners, particularly street vendors, Mazzuca said.<br />
<br />
He said doesn't believe that Italians generally are racists and hopes Kyenge will be able to ease racial tensions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I really think that Kyenge is the right person in the right place,&quot; he said. &quot;As an eye doctor, she is able to see in the distance.&quot;

How to build your own Tardis By Mark Ward<br />
 <br />
Technology correspondent, BBC News<br />
 <br />

Meet Yoz who built her own Tardis in her living room<br />

DIY Tardis is 'bigger on its inside' <br />
Building a better corkscrew <br />
<br />
For some fans of TV shows knowing the trivia, quoting the best lines and dressing like their heroes is just not enough. They need something more, something bigger, to demonstrate their devotion. Among dedicated Dr Who fans, Whovians, that something more, the ultimate expression of fandom, involves building a Tardis.<br />
<br />
It is a not a project for the faint-hearted, said David Lifton who built one for his son Rhys - the Whovian in the family. <br />
<br />
&quot;It took an entire spring through summer of evenings and weekends to complete the build from start to finish, probably about five months in all,&quot; Mr Lifton told the BBC. <br />
<br />
Apart from the sheer graft of cutting wood to make all the parts and then constructing the Tardis (which doubles as a garden shed), the hardest part was finding good plans to work from, Mr Lifton explained. As with many other geek maker projects, the web was invaluable.<br />
<br />
One of the main places people share plans, pictures and photos of their project is the tardisbuilders.com website. Part confessional, part parts list, the site is a goldmine for anyone coveting their own blue box.<br />
<br />
&quot;I came up with the outline drawings and proportions from a basic diagram I found for one of the original Doctor Who films,&quot; he said. This, along with close inspection of the many Tardis toys that Rhys owns, helped refine the final design.<br />
<br />
Mr Lifton admits that his Tardis is a bit of a &quot;hybrid&quot; in that it combines elements of the 1960s Peter Brachacki version and the craft David Tennant and Matt Smith have been zipping around in.<br />
<br />
Which Who<br />
 <br />
For many of the faithful that have built their own Tardis, mixing elements from more than one Tardis would be unthinkable. For them, producing an exact copy of a particular Tardis is the reason for undertaking the project. <br />
<br />
Michael Pickwoad, the current Dr Who production designer, said matching the show version is tricky because the look of the TV Tardis is not nailed down.<br />
<br />
Rhys Lifton plus Tardis Rhys Lifton's Tardis doubles as a garden shed when it is not travellling the universe <br />
&quot;From story to story we add bits and pieces,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Some of those changes are demanded by the plot of an episode and mean the exterior of the Tardis changes to reflect where the time-travelling gadget is going. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes it's aged over 500 years suddenly,&quot; he added. <br />
<br />
That would mean the paint would be scuffed and the whole box would look battered to reinforce the idea that it has travelled a long way in time and space. <br />
<br />
Then there are the changes that production designers make from series to series or with the introduction of a new Who. To the uninitiated the changes might be subtle, but to those who are trying to recreate a particular Tardis they are crucial. <br />
<br />
The changes involve the small windows at the top of the doors, the light on top, the poster on the front, the position of the door handle and lock and the stepping around the roof. And then there is the colour of the paint.<br />
<br />
&quot;The colours have changed and its now slightly bluer than it was,&quot; said Mr Pickwoad, adding that there might be changes to that colour in the future.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was to do another one, another box, we might paint it a different hue of the same colour,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Time watch<br />
 <br />
Mr Lifton solved the problem of the paint by writing to Dr Who Magazine and asking them. They wrote back with the RGB (red, green, blue) values that let him get a paint that was close enough.<br />
<br />
For Whovian Yoz, who prefers not to use her real name, finding the right colour was a much more exhaustive process. Prior to building her police box Yoz built a dossier of all the different versions and the hues of blue they sported. <br />
<br />
She was just as thorough when it came to working out the dimensions of the Tardis she wanted to emulate - the one piloted by Peter Davison. <br />
<br />
Tardis blues Yoz went to great lengths to ensure her Tardis was as accurate as possible <br />
&quot;I planned it in extreme detail,&quot; she told the BBC and then produced a thick file of plans, pictures and notes she accumulated while preparing, planning and building. <br />
<br />
Her full size Tardis dominates the main room in her flat and doubles as a climbing frame and hang out spot for her cat. <br />
<br />
For people who are not Whovians, creating a Tardis might seem strange.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems natural to me to want to have a Tardis,&quot; she said, adding that the idea was hard to shake once it was conceived. &quot;I could not stop thinking about it and the only solution, the only way to get this idea out of my head, was to build it. To do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
So she did, even though taking on such an exacting project was harder for her than for most because she suffers from dyscalculia, a condition that made working out the dimensions of the Tardis tricky. She got around this problem by making full size plans of the Tardis and using those a guide when she was sawing and shaping the parts.<br />
<br />
All told, she said, the Tardis has taken her about a year to make and she still is not done. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still not entirely happy with it,&quot; she said. &quot;The final stage is to make it dirty so it looks like it has been used.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Yoz talks about creating her Tardis it is clear that the building project has had an impact on much more than the internal decor of her flat. It has inspired her to get on with many other things, given her new skills and confidence and changed her life. <br />
<br />
When John Lifton talks about his Tardis he mentions how much the achievement meant when he finished it and the way it inspired him to tackle other do it yourself projects. <br />
<br />
Other people on the Tardis builders forum say the same. It is not just about what you get at the end of the project, it's about what happens along the way.<br />
<br />
It is just like the TV Tardis, whenever and whereever it turns up, lives are profoundly changed, lessons are learned and possibilities are seized. <br />
<br />
Maybe that is why he is called the Doctor.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>The Wolverine &gt; Man of Steel &gt; Ironman 3<br />
<br />
Best Superhero movie to come out this year (so far). I don't know if it was based on a comic storyline (I think it was, to some extent anyway. I seem to remember reading a few parts that were included in this movie), but they did a very good job of &quot;rebooting&quot; the franchise while at the same time keeping everything that happened in the first three X-Men movies there. They completely ignore that &quot;other&quot; Wolverine movie and if they just want to pretend that that movie doesn't exist I'm ok with that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I highly recommend this film. The train scene, while ridiculous, was pretty freaking cool.<br />
<br />
Huh, I just realized that I like all three of those superhero movies so far this summer. It's been a good year for comic films and Thor 2 isn't even out yet.</div>

Team is facing an issue where we're only allowed to deploy at most once every 3 months.  This tends to be a time consuming and tedious process that takes up most of the night and the following morning.  We'd like to be able to knock the time between deployments down (ideally moving towards a Continuous Deployment or Delivery model, but that's a way off).  What would I, as a member of the development team, have to convince you to let us touch production more regularly?</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Just got notice yesterday, baring any last minute issues with our &quot;day 1 patch&quot;, we are DONE! Made our street dates with one of the largest console games I've ever seen: &quot;contentwise&quot;. All indicators such as presales are double / triple original estimates, as well as the media hype behind it and retail support (you wont believe the store coverage planned for this fall... Target stores for example are going to theme out their whole stores).<br />
<br />
Anyway they gave me 6 weeks paid &quot;compensation time&quot; off... so I dont have to show back up until mid sept or something. Gawd I dunno it it was worth it... gave up alot of personal things for this project, missed my boys entire 6th grade school year and now most of the summer vacation break, as well as personal time with the wife, just going out to dinner or spendig time alone. I just hope to hell Infinity2 has a somewhat reasonable schedual (management is promising this but they suck at keeping promises). So yea, I get a breather for a while. Nearly 11 months of crunch. <br />
<br />
I do apologize to everyone for the mass media onslaught about to decend on every digital media device you all own, as well as theatres... the advertising budget is insane and I think they are planning mass runs from here till christmas. There might be a kid or two deep in the jungles of Africa that wont have heard of Infinity by the of the year, but not many.</div>

.... The Court has considered the movants' remaining arguments and finds them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the motions to quash Chevron's subpoena to Microsoft [DI 1, 2] are denied.  SO ORDERED.  Dated: June 25, 2013<br />

<br />
Summary:<br />
<br />
Activists were attempting to stop some of Chevron's activities via legal action in Ecuador.  Chevron asked Microsoft to share details of their accounts on Hotmail and their e-mail.  Activists complained and the Judge finds against them, so Chevron legally has the activists information which Chevron can use against them in court.<br />
<br />
End of Summary<br />
<br />
Shit like this is why I am paranoid and take measures to limit access to my data, measures which tech apparently has no qualms about defeating and undermining; it is pretty depressing having peers act as hostile agents against your own happiness rather than behaving ethically.</div>
