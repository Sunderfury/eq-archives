 “After triangulating against multiple data sources, it’s clear that <i>Guild Wars 2</i> is  the fastest-selling Western MMO of all time based on the first nine  months of availability”, said analyst David Cole of DFC Intelligence.  “This puts <i>Guild Wars 2</i> in an impressive position when they release in China, where we’ve seen similar franchises really take off”.<br />
 <i>Guild Wars 2</i> is expected to experience rapid growth once it  releases in China, where the player-base has the potential to exceed  that of the West.

I will be around that weekend and would love to shepherd people through some zones and have some fun watching Baelan fall off of jumping puzzles.  <br />
<br />
The game is best played with others in Vent doing events and levelling up.  The game systems are not the same as what you are used to in other MMOs so it's better to have someone work you through it.</div>

<br />
Go to soe.com<br />
<br />
Log in with the account you wish to apply for beta with.<br />
<br />
Copy paste the link below and add the h infront of ttps (removed it because it kept resetting to a shortened url link)<br />

ttps://account.station.sony.com/authenticated/beta/signUpForBetaRedirect.action?theme=eql&amp;betaId=17&amp;s  ervice=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.everquestnext.com%2fbeta-registration<br />

press enter.<br />
<br />
Will then get the normal &quot;do you wish to use NA/EU&quot; window popup. Pick whatever. The link above will automatically register you for beta. Should get an email confirmation immediately. So if there are any bonuses from having played EQ before (such as preferred Beta access or in game goodies) then you will now be able to get them. And you do not have to deal with whatever company is doing the EU side (+ double beta chance if you already registered a new account to apply for the EU beta)</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>With the open beta coming up next weekend (August 17th -- 16th if you played in a previous beta) I'm just wondering if anyone else is going to pick this up?<br />
<br />
If so myself and my group of friends will be on the Behemoth server.<br />
<br />
It's very traditional in the sense of MMO trinity and whatnot but basically the new dev team admitted the last version was utter shit and they've really turned it into an entirely new game.<br />
<a href="http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><br />
http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/</a><br />
<br />
Phase 4 Open Beta:<br />
-Characters will carry through to Early Access/Launch<br />
-Level restricted to 20<br />
-All classes/crafting classes available (including Fishing and Arcanist)<br />
<br />
Also worth noting from level 10 onwards you can unlock and swap to the other classes simply by equipping the classes' weapon so you can try everything out. It also gives you cross class skills to take to round out your character to your liking.<br />
<br />

<br />
  <b>August 6 Content Release Notes</b><br />
<br />
 <b>LIVING WORLD</b><br />
<b>Queen’s Jubilee</b><br />
A celebration to commemorate ten years of Queen Jennah’s rule is about  to kick off in Divinity’s Reach! The queen has commissioned a new  gladiatorial arena for the occasion—the Crown Pavilion—as a shining  symbol of her people’s endurance. Take a hot air balloon ride with  dignitaries from across Tyria to the capital of the Krytan nation, and  be there for the opening ceremony. Join in the festivities and compete  in ceremonial combat in Her Majesty’s honor!<br />
 <b>Hot Air Balloons</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">The queen’s court has sent out hot air balloons to transport celebrants! Look for balloon towers all over Tyria.</li><li style="">Ascend to the top of a balloon tower to claim a royal gift before embarking on the journey to Divinity’s Reach.</li><li style="">Watch for all-new dynamic events as the balloon pilots may need help keeping everything running smoothly.</li><li style="">A special hot air balloon souvenir will be given to players who are festive enough to visit 30 towers.</li></ul><br />
 <b>The Crown Pavilion</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">The arts district in Divinity’s Reach that was destroyed by the  Great Collapse has been rebuilt into the Crown Pavilion, a grand arena  that will host Kryta’s biggest events.</li><li style="">Enter the Queen’s Gauntlet to battle mighty representations of humanity’s most vicious enemies.</li><li style="">Visit the emissaries from six major nations of Tyria. A unique set  of boons to improve magic find and combat stats will be available to  those who wish to represent the emissaries.</li><li style="">Earn Watchwork Sprockets, a new trophy from the Watchknights, to  purchase rewards from the emissaries. Purchasable rewards include:<br />
<ul><li style="">New Sovereign weapon sets</li><li style="">New crafting recipes for runes and sigils</li><li style="">Cultural weapon sets</li></ul></li></ul><br />
 <b>The Queen’s Gauntlet</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Face increasingly difficult challenges in single combat against a variety of unique bosses.</li><li style="">Take a risk with special gambit conditions to earn even more prestigious rewards.</li><li style="">Each entry and gambit costs one Queen’s Gauntlet ticket. Tickets  drop regularly from creatures in the Crown Pavilion and around the  world. Players may also purchase tickets from the emissaries in the  Crown Pavilion.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Opening Ceremony</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Witness the unveiling of the Crown Pavilion in a brand new Living  World story instance featuring familiar faces such as Queen Jennah,  Logan Thackeray, Countess Anise, Lord Faren, Rox, and Braham.</li><li style="">Rumors are running high that the queen will be taking volunteers  for the inaugural contest with the Watchknights. There’s no telling who  might show up!</li><li style="">Enter the instanced area simply by visiting the Crown Pavilion for the first time.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Beacons of Kryta</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Find torchbearers around Divinity’s Reach to activate a special time-limited race to light several beacons around the city.</li><li style="">Successfully complete all four torch runs to earn the Flames of  Kryta, a permanent item that can be used to illuminate the player’s path  through darkness.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Achievements</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">A rotation of Living World achievements has been added to the Daily Achievement category.</li><li style="">Completing the Queen’s Jubilee meta-achievement awards the player a  Mini Watchknight. Completing this meta-achievement requires players to  complete 18 achievements from either the Queen’s Jubilee category or the  jubilee-related dailies.</li></ul><br />
 <b>Exotic Drop</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">Play Queen’s Jubilee content for a chance at the exotic Watchwork Portal Device recipe.</li><li style="">The recipe requires a level 400 artificer. It requires 5 Orichalcum  Ingots, 1 Master Tuning Crystal, 1 Charged Lodestone, and 75 Watchwork  Sprockets.</li><li style="">The Watchwork Portal Device is a one-time use consumable that  allows players to create a portal between two points. It cannot be used  in conjunction with the mesmer’s portal.</li></ul><br />

 <b>Currency Wallet</b><br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">All players now have a new currency wallet that can be found in the  Hero panel. All currencies on a character are transferred to the  player’s currency wallet when they log in with that character. Players  will need to log in with all of their characters to get all of their  currency transferred.</li><li style="">All currencies are now account bound.</li></ul><br />
 <b>BALANCE, BUG-FIXING, POLISH</b><br />
<b>General</b><br />
<b>Champion Loot</b><br />
 <br />

 *Improved Effects Culling<br />
*<br />
 <br />
<ul><li style="">In the open world, dungeons, PvP, and WvW, the new effects-culling  system will slowly start reducing the detail of each effect in order to  increase combat visibility when many effect types are overlapping.</li></ul><br />
