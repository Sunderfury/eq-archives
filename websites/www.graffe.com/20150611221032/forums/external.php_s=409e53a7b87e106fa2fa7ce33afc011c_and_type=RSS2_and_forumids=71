			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Steam sale has begun. Remember to wait for daily deals (or their equivalents) for the best prices. If something you want doesn't get the additional discount by the final day, then you can feel free to purchase without being burned. I'm off to a good start, one of the things I wanted is already a daily (Homeworld).<br />
<br />
Steam Summer badges are back, and they have a new meta theme this year. They've got some kind of special literal game to play that unlocks additional deals as the community reaches milestones. I haven't tried it yet.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>E3 should be pretty big this year, but it seems like the focus is drifting away from new hardware and first party, and more towards third party games that were noticeable absent from the past two E3s. Notable, there are three additional press conferences this year, including the first ever PC only press event.<br />
<br />
Starting this thread early, as there are often reveals and leaks before E3 starts, as well as to act as a (small) resource/guide to what you can expect. I'll start off with a summary of the press events, followed by what I think we might actually see at these events. <br />

	</div>
</div><b>Bethesda</b><br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Fallout 4 - Just announced. I'm expecting gameplay + a release date for this year. Maybe spring.</li><li style="">Doom - Announced last year (I think?). We are due some gameplay. Previously only Quakecon attendees were allowed to see it.</li><li style="">Dishonored 2 - Hasn't been announced. Maybe it will be?</li><li style="">BattleCry - Their moba. If it still exists I would expect to see something from it.</li><li style="">They will probably mention Elder Scrolls mmo for consoles, if not here, at Microsoft or Sony's event.</li><li style="">Bethesda has started publishing more games from other studios (The Evil Within from last year, for example). Maybe we will get another new thing like that.</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Microsoft</b><br />
<br />
I expect Microsoft to go very heavy on exclusive games this year in an attempt to make up lost ground with the PS4.<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Halo 5: Guardians - This will make or break Microsoft. Sony's got nothing to compete, but 343 studios has had some rocky history with the franchise lately. If they don't deliver fans will be pissed. What little I've seen looks good though.</li><li style="">Gears of War - Microsoft previously had new studio Black Tusk working on a new IP, but they eventually bought out the Gears of War franchise from Epic, and tasked them with making a new game. Expect to get the first glimpse of it this year.</li><li style="">Forza Motorsport 6 - Because they always have Forza.</li><li style="">Crackdown 3 - They announced it awhile back but to my knowledge haven't shown it yet.</li><li style="">Rise of the Tomb Raider - This is their big third party &quot;exclusive&quot;. They are going to push this hard, as this holiday the PS4 will not have it, or a reasonable competitor. I have reservations. It's going to be a December title. Almost nothing comes out in December. This means it is being rushed specifically to exploit this weakness of Sony's and make up lost ground. Could go either way.</li><li style="">They might mention Fable Legends, the F2P co-op Fable spinoff that they have previously shown.</li><li style="">I do not think they will mention Hololens. It's possible, but it seems like such a shot in the dark. I think it's too early, it's not even a product yet, just an idea of a product.</li><li style="">More Killer Instinct seasons?</li><li style="">Battletoads - Not the hottest property in my opinion, but fans have been asking for it, and Microsoft delivered on Killer Instinct. I could see it happening.</li><li style="">Lastly, I expect the new Call of Duty at Microsoft's event. People are theorizing it will be at Sony's because that is where the user base is now, but I think they will stick with Microsoft.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>EA</b><br />
<br />
I sort of wonder if this might be the year of Star Wars. I think they will hope to capitalize on brewing Star Wars movie hype and show off a few of their other Star Wars titles in development.<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Star Wars: Battlefront - This one is a given. They teased it last year, and showed off the hype trailer a month or so ago. I'm expecting this to get the biggest push out of everything they show.</li><li style="">Visceral's Star Wars game - Written by Amy Hennig (Uncharted), and possibly using assets from the defunct 1313. We know they have been working on this, I think it's time to show it.</li><li style="">Unannounced Star Wars game - Their exclusivity deal with Disney only mentions Dice and Visceral, but they might tease us with what could come later.</li><li style="">Need for Speed - They took a break. Now they are making another one.</li><li style="">Mirror's Edge - We are probably due a closer look at this.</li><li style="">Last year they barely showed anything. They might show more from some of the stuff they teased.</li><li style="">Maybe Mass Effect. I think it might still be too early, especially if they can just let Star Wars carry the show this year.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Ubisoft</b><br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Assassin's Creed - Because they insist on making one every year.</li><li style="">Rainbow Six: Siege - This is probably their big game for this year. When they first showed it, it already looked pretty far along.</li><li style="">The Division - It's been a long time coming, but it's coming, and they should probably prove that. 2016.</li><li style="">Surprise - They like surprises. Maybe a new Splinter Cell? Maybe that new &quot;Hero&quot; IP that got semi leaked?<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Sony</b><br />
<br />
Sony seems to be in a bad place this year. Everything we know about either came out early this year, or has been delayed to next year. I expect them to lean very heavily on third parties.<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Uncharted - It comes out next year, but as their biggest first party game they will probably mention it.</li><li style="">Ratchet and Clank - Also delayed to 2016, but they haven't shown anything at all (to my knowledge) of it, so might as well get on that.</li><li style="">Bloodborne Expansion - They hinted that new Bloodborne DLC is in the works. I could see them using new content for this as a way to stretch their presence in first party releases.</li><li style="">Uncharted Collection for PS4 - Another easy way to stretch their catalogue while waiting for new stuff to start getting made.</li><li style="">Guerrilla Games IP - The Killzone guys. We know they have been making a new IP, but they haven't shown it yet.</li><li style="">New God of War maybe?</li><li style="">Instead of Call of Duty, I expect Sony and Activision to double down on Destiny. There will be another big expansion this holiday and I expect them to show it.</li><li style="">I also expect Sony to very heavily promote Battlefront. Both companies are going to push this hard to carry holiday sales this year. It's going to be a big game.</li><li style="">Sony's VR solution, Morpheus, may get a retail bundle and pricing announced. Rumor is they are the closest to release out of all the various VR options.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Nintendo</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of having a press conference last year, Nintendo had a scheduled online steaming &quot;event&quot;. I thought it was the best show of last year, so look forward to what they do this year, though I have little idea on what to actually be excited about.<br />
They have already come out and said NO Zelda, and NO NX (their next console). This implies to me that they must have something else of value to show. (I always thought Zelda looked early)<br />
<br />
<ul><li style="">Star Fox - Teased previously, not really shown yet. Might be their biggest game, but I'm skeptical. I like the series, but it's going to take a lot to make any real impact.</li><li style="">Yoshi's Wooly World - They've shown a lot of this. It's got to be close to release. Their holiday game?</li><li style="">Xenoblade Chronicles - Still not out. Shouldn't be much longer.</li><li style="">Shin Megami/Fire Emblem crossover - They finally showed this a few months ago. Should be a pretty big jrpg.</li><li style="">Fire Emblem if - The new 3DS Fire Emblem that was recently announced.</li><li style="">Mario Maker - Should be due soon.</li><li style="">Devil's Third - Does this really still exist?</li><li style="">Metroid - I say this every year.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Square Enix</b><br />
<br />
Like Bethesda, the idea is they wouldn't have their own press conference if they didn't have a lot of stuff to show off. I sort of feel like they have been inching towards this with their E3 coverage from last year, so am not expecting anything earth shattering, but between Square-Enix and Eidos, they should have a lot of stuff.<br />
<ul><li style="">Eidos</li><li style="">Tomb Raider - Extended look from what you get at the Microsoft event.</li><li style="">New Deux Ex, already announced. Show gameplay.</li><li style="">Just Cause 3, already announced. Show gameplay.</li><li style="">Possibly a new Hitman.</li><li style="">SE likes to experiment with turning Eidos properties into F2P and mmo style games. Triad Wars for example, the Sleeping Dogs spinoff, hasn't been shown yet.</li><li style="">Small chance at Legacy of Kain/Soul Reaver revival. <br />
<br />
Square Enix</li><li style="">Dragon Quest - They have a few of these in the works, they could show one. The two off the top of my head are a Dynasty Warriors style game, and a Theaterhythm game.</li><li style="">Bravely Default Sequel - They have been promoting this a lot in Japan. Could be worth a mention and a trailer.</li><li style="">Star Ocean - A new one of these was recently announced. They could start promoting it.</li><li style="">Final Fantasy 15 - I think they have said they will not show it at E3 this year. It's got to be close to done though.</li><li style="">Kingdom Hearts 3 - I will be surprised if they show this. I think it's too early still. Maybe a trailer though.</li><li style="">Final Fantasy Type 0 PC port<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>PC Gaming</b><br />
<br />
At 3 hours, I think this one has the biggest potential for being a flop. It's the first time they have had a PC press conference for E3, but it isn't the first time something similar has been tried elsewhere. Still, if you are a PC stalwart, there will surely be a few things you find interesting.<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly what they might be showing, so I'll list what these companies are known for. This is the guest list from what I understand:<br />
<ul><li style="">Day[9] - Starcraft 2 commentator. Will be hosting.</li><li style="">Blizzard Entertainment - They have their own event, so instead of new announcements, I expect them to talk about stuff we already know about. That shooter they are making, for example.</li><li style="">Microsoft Studios - Windows 10 and DX12 talk. Maybe Fable Legends. Maybe Halo collection. (I hope)</li><li style="">Bohemia Interactive - They make ARMA 3, so something similar I guess?</li><li style="">Paradox Interactive - They make a lot of smaller PC titles. Wiki suggests something called Hollowpoint, previously announced, which I've never heard of.</li><li style="">Obsidian Entertainment - Big rpg guys. I don't know what they could show. They just released Pillars of Eternity.</li><li style="">Tripwire Interactive - Killing Floor 2, most likely. Very popular with the PC shooter crowd.</li><li style="">ArenaNet - I don't follow Guild Wars 2 lately. New expansion? Guild Wars 3? Dunno.</li><li style="">The Creative Assembly - Total War Warhammer. I forgot to tell you guys this got announced. I'm sorry.</li><li style="">Frictional Games - Known for horror cult classic Amnesia. Working on something called Soma? Not familiar.</li><li style="">Frontier Developments - Elite Dangerous</li><li style="">SCS Software - Blank Truck Simulator</li><li style="">Splash Damage - Dirty Bomb. Team based shooter from the people who made Brink.</li><li style="">Square Enix - Maybe ports they didn't have time to show in their own event, or that tech demo from the last big PC conference.</li><li style="">Cloud Imperium Games - Star Citizen</li><li style="">Devolver Digital - They make a lot of solid indie games, so something like that.</li><li style="">A few developers were called out by name, though I only remember one off the top of my head, and don't know what they might present.<br />
</li></ul><br />
<br />
<b>Other</b><br />
<br />
Games that don't fall into the Umbrella above, but that we may still see in some capacity:<br />
<br />
Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain - Releases this year. Probably at Microsoft or Sony's event. (Sony has less to show, so I'm betting on them)<br />
XCOM 2 - Just announced.<br />
Mad Max - Confirmed to be shown. Open world Mad Max game made by Just Cause developer (I think).<br />
Lego Dimensions - Lego's take on Skylanders and Infinity toy/video game crossovers. They just announced a lot of the various properties that will be present. Back to the Future, Dr Who, Scooby Doo, etc.<br />
Battleborn - 2K's shooter/moba hybrid, from Gearbox. <br />
Disney Infinity 3.0 - Did someone say Star Wars? I think someone said Star Wars. Star Waaarrrss.<br />
Guitar Hero/Rock Band - Both announced recently. <br />
Persona - Atlus will probably show the rhythm game spinoff, but everyone (not so) secretly hopes for Persona 5.<br />
<br />
And many more that I am too tired to possibly remember. Dang forum tried to eat this thread while I was typing it. It took too long to type and I got a little carried away. If there are readability issues, please let me know.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I was expecting June to be even dryer than May, with E3 and the Steam Summer Sale being where most of the video game related excitement for the month comes from, but there are actually quite a fair number of notable games being released this month.<br />
<br />
The biggest by far would have to be <b>Batman: Arkham Knight</b>. The Arkham series has gone from the underdog no one would thought would be good, to one of the most popular currently running franchises, and this is Rocksteady's third and final entry in the series. It will be &quot;current gen&quot; only, skipping the old consoles in favor of the new (plus PC), so expectations are high. <br />
<br />
The new generation of consoles are also getting the <b>Elder Scrolls Online</b> mmo, as well as an enhanced port of <b>Devil May Cry 4</b>. Remasters and remakes are getting out of hand lately, but supposedly this one adds a surprising amount of additional value. I really enjoyed my time with the original, and would encourage anyone interested in the series or genre that missed it the first time to check it out.<br />
<br />
Not much for handhelds this month, it seems. <b>Operation Abyss</b> for the Vita is a dungeon crawling jrpg (wizardry, grimrock) with pretty good art made by the people who did Demon Gaze, I believe. I know absolutely nothing about <b>Lord of Magna: Maiden Heaven</b> for the 3DS, and am pretty sure it only even got announced earlier last month. If you like the kind of stuff Xseed releases it's worth knowing about, but I'm skeptical myself.<br />
<br />
There a few notable mentions for PC. <b>Heroes of the Storm</b>, aka Blizzard dota, officially launches. It's pretty good. <b>Massive Chalice</b>, the generational strategy game from Double Fine, is finally leaving Early Access. I believe <b>Shadowrun: Hong Kong</b> is due soon, and probably several other indie scale games without official launch dates announced.<br />
<br />
More than all that though, <b>D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die</b> is coming to PC this month. D4 is an adventure game from Swery65, the man responsible for Deadly Premonition. Deadly Premonition was known for being a bit buggy, but bizarre and creative. D4 supposedly ups that ante. It was previously an Xone exclusive, but only the most dedicated paid it any attention. I remember the creator tweeting &quot;someone please help!&quot; because the sales were so bad.<br />
<br />
The one caveat worth mentioning on this is that the story is episodic and I have no idea about the possibility of future episodes. I don't know if Microsoft is publishing or if sales alone will guarantee future entries. A PC release is a stroke of luck though, and hopefully the Steam userbase appreciates the game more than the Xbox userbase did.<br />
<br />
Finally, there is supposed to be a <b>Lego Jurassic World</b> game coming out for, well, everything. I assume it will coincide with the movie, but other than knowing about its existence I have heard and seen nothing about it.<br />
<br />
<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>well beyond the usual &quot;get saddelbags to increase your carrying cspacity and explore every nook and cranny&quot;, as you'd expect from an RPG ;)<br />
here's some tips :)<br />
<br />
<br />
1)be aware you can only have in operation upgrades abilities you have PUT INTO THE SLOTS FOR YOUR CHARACTER!<br />
this is not obvious to begin with<br />
you unlock 1 slot per character level up to about lvl 12<br />
if you want your upgraded ability to work, you have to drag it over to an open slot for it to work<br />
<br />
note the Axii sign, which mind controls, can be used in NPC dialogue at times to hypnotize them into doing things<br />
I THINK that is one exception that can always be used without being &quot;slotted&quot; in, but in any case, you can always reload, slot the power in for that conversation, then remove it from the slot and replace.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) kill wolves! KILL 'EM!<br />
not only are they a pain in the arse :p but their livers are excellent food items to regen health<br />
wolf, rabbit. hare and deer pelts can be sold for cash, it seems to me some merchants notably inkeeps seem to give more for pelts (at least one in starting area did)<br />
you can use crossbow, or the flame/stun powers to kill, also the mind control power can stun as you can come up to do a <i>coup de grace</i> with a Strong attack<br />
Wolves also drop &quot;dog fat&quot;, if I remember the name correct, an alchemy item, you get tons killing wolves so can sell that, as well<br />
<br />
3) The Yrden power upgraded &quot;trap&quot; power rocks<br />
I use it to kill so many enemies, lol, positioning it at corners, or before fights<br />
It is THE best power against wraiths and ghostly enemies<br />
<br />
4) the &quot;shielding&quot; power is one I'd recommend increasing right away<br />
Saves you a LOT of damage, and the knock back effect of the upgraded version is extremely useful<br />
<br />
5) the fire power is extremely good versus bears and wolves<br />
<br />
6) the Aard telekinesis power is good because if an enemy is knocked down you can do a coup de grace on them<br />
note you often can use it to break down doors or bulldoze rubble<br />
<br />
7) runes, armour etc that improve the power of your magic abilities are REALLY good<br />
upgrading Aard for example means it knocks down more often<br />
the &quot;Medium&quot; armour types tend to increase Sign strength<br />
<br />
8) a sword with 3 rune slots can be better than a sword with more damage (to an extent!)<br />
as fitting 3 runes can do freezing,fire etc<br />
of course, increased crits, bleeding, stun are great abilities and such innate powers make a weapon worth keeping a long while<br />
<br />
9) when in a boat or swimming, keep the &quot;Witcher senses&quot; ability on, you will reveal many sunken treasures that way<br />
<br />
10) the crossbow is an insta kill power when used underwater on most enemies!<br />
<br />
11) don't aim with the auxiliary weapon attacks, ie crossbow, bombs etc, unless you HAVE to because the auto aim is very good<br />
&quot;Grapeshot&quot; bombs are soooo good at blasting away groups of angry peasants :p<br />
Note also explosive type sof bombs like grapeshot are needed to &quot;kill&quot; &quot;Monster nests&quot; by blowing them shut<br />
<br />
12) in general, dismantle at least half the armour/weapons you get, to use later to craft your own, ESPECIALLY the &quot;relic&quot; (dark orange background) gear, as that often has rare components.<br />
<br />
13) it's not obvious at first, but, if you or the NPC choses to PASS in the card game of Gwent, it means you forfeit ALL further moves in that round<br />
it is often a good tactic on the first round of battle, if the enemy had such force on the board that you'd be left with few cards even if you manage to win<br />
resigning and saving your cards for the next round can be good<br />
note that the rare HERO cards, which have a sunburst in upper corner, are immune to all special effects like weather etc<br />
<br />
personally I like King Foltest,north armies as suite, and take him with the ability to CLEAR WEATHER once per fight, as that's very handy<br />
<br />
14) repair gear! like Fallout games, if weapons/armour gets worn down, it is less effective<br />
hence on long quests through dungeons, the repair kits are very handy</div>
