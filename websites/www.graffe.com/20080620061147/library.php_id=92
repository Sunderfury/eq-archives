<br>
<br>
<font size=6>RECOMMENDATIONS:<font size=4>
<br>
<br>
-Be at least 65 (you NEED shock of magic or SoS)
<br>
-At least a 4500 mana pool (I do it with a 5500, and I have 20% leftover)
<br>
-Be fairly experienced in kiting (everyone should know this ;))
<br>
-SCM3 will work wonders here, but it isn't required
<br>
<br>
<font size=6>GETTING THERE:<font size=4> *SKIP THIS IF YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW*To get to Thundercrest from PoK...take the Nektulos stone, then run to Lavastorm (northwest end). Once you are inside Lavastorm, run to the very north end and zone into the Broodlands (you most likely have a map to look at) Once you're inside the Broodlands, head northeast and follow the wall until you get to the desert part. Now, look for a set of 5 stones near the water with a portal inside. Step on the portal and you will be taken to Thundercrest.
<br>
<br>
Once inside, invis up and head straight through the gates. (con everything, sometimes the mobs see invis) Keep going straight until you hit a 2-way split. Head right and follow the wall until you see another gate on the right-hand side. Take it. You should now be at a set of stairs on either side of you. Take the right set and head straight out to the corner of this island. Notice that no mobs spawn or wander to here....this is your camping spot.
<br>
<br>
<font size=6>SPELL LINEUP:<font size=4> Here are the spells I use for this camp:
<br>
<br>
-Shock of Magic
<br>
-Ice Spear of Solist
<br>
-Atol's Spectral Shackles
<br>
-Harvest
<br>
-Fetter (not greater, just the regular)
<br>
-Abscond
<br>
-your choice

<br>
<font size=6>THE MOBS:<font size=4> Here is what you're looking to kill:
<br>
<br>
A puma
<br>
Level 60-62 
<br>
HP: ~25k-30k
<br>
Summons? No
<br>
Immune to anything? No
<br>
Things to note: These guys have a fairly high magic resist, so be careful. They run pretty fast too.
<br>
<br>
<br>
A swirling dervish
<br>
Level: 62-64 (roughly)
<br>
HP: 24k-29k (less than the pumas, but not by much)
<br>
Summons: No
<br>
Immune to anything? No, but resists are a pain
<br>
Things to note: These guys run MUCH slower than the pumas...but seem to have higher resists.
<br>
<br>
<font size=6>HERE'S WHAT YOU DO:<font size=4>
<br>
From where you're sitting against the corner, there will be a puma spawn straight out near a rock. Pull it with snare....if you get a resist, don't worry, there is plenty of room to run around and resnare. Once snare finally holds, I would recommend the root/nuke/root/nuke. If you want, you can try simply snare kiting it, however it is fairly tricky due to their speed (dervishes are EASY to snare kite though ;)) Start blasting it down with Shock of Magic or SoS. A 2700 damage nuke takes it down about 10%, but it varies by the enemy. Every 5 nukes or so, recast snare. Note that you WILL get resisted sometimes, but if you have SCM3, it won't matter too much. The best part is, they run at about 15%, so if you need to med, go for it.
<br>
When you're done with the puma, feel free to pull anything else. It's a huge island, you will never run out of mobs unless a raid goes through.
<br>
<br>
<font size=6>REWARDS AND XP<font size=4>
<br>
At 66, I was getting about 10% AA from the dervishes, and about 8-9% from the pumas, which is really great, considering this place is undercamped. Normal is about .5 - a tick a kill, so thats pretty good too. These guys also drop high end gems pretty commonly, so money is decent...but the best part is, these guys have a chance (very slim) to drop this:

Good luck! If you need any help, send Kindacute a tell on Bertox/Tholuxe server :)</td></tr></table></body></html>
