This was one of my favorite quadding spots at my early 60's. Great xp, great loot, almost always available, pop a lesson up and you're good to go :)

Zone into Plane of Disease, and invis up. Run along east wall above the dirty water, and keep following it north. After long enough, you will start to see a bunch of mini houses, filled with puslings. Invis past them, and head to the far north wall. You will notice nothing wanders here, and it is fairly safe. This will be your med/camp point
<br>
<br>
When invised, search the houses for the one with foul puslings. NOTE: You will ONLY be pulling foul puslings, as all the others summon. If I recall, the foul puslings are in the house towards the center....anyway, there are 8 here: 2 at the door, and 6 inside. 
<br>
<br>
To pull them: Facing the front of the foul pusling house, target the one on the right, run to max pulling range behind it, and T-Flux. If done correctly, 4 and only 4 should come. If done incorrectly, 5 or 6 should come. When you're 60-62, it might be best to Abscond, however, when you're 63-65, you might be able to root them and hold them there. Run the four you pull back to the wall, avoiding the house on your left when running back. Now that you are in a safe place, kite them up and down the north wall using PoFlame, resnare at 50% if needed.
<br>
<br>
The only real danger here is that you might pull an add from one of the houses if you get too close. Aside from that, it's fairly safe. Experience is about .5% a kill at 61, and 3% AA a kill. Good luck!</td></tr></table></body></html>
