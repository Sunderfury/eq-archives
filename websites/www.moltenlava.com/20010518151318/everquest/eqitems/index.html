    <p align="left"><u>6.15.99</u> The following sections have been updated, <font color="#EBBE0E"><a href="magicslashing.htm">Slashing</a><big>,</big><a href="magicpiercing.htm">Piercing</a><small>, </small><a href="magicrjewelry.htm">Jewelry</a>
    <a href="magicrmisc.htm">Misc.</a> <a href="magicarmor.htm">Armor</a>. And I did kind of
    mess up the Piercing section, I deleted a page on mistake, so that will be fixed tomorrow.
    I hope you all are enjoying the new updates and keep sending in new items.<strong><u>

    <p align="left"><u>6.14.99</u> Sections updated so far <a href="magicrmisc.htm">Misc</a>. <a href="magicpiercing.htm">Piercing</a> and <a href="magicblunt.htm">Blunt</a>. I am on the
    look out for Deamon Claws, The staff with the Skull on it&nbsp; and The skull alone. I
    have about 7 more items to add, that WILL be added tomarrow. <a href="mailto:cybermurray@moltenlava.com"><strong><u>Ttegrus</u></strong></a></p>
    <p align="left"><u>6.14.99</u> Welcome one and all. Well as some of&nbsp; you have noticed
    there have ben no updates for some time. And for that I am sorry. However I am doing a
    update tonight and hope to do more very soon. After much thought I am not going to set up
    a new section just for lore items since so many items are going to get set to *LORE*. One
    last note, I am now going by my new Char.s name since you most likely wont see Brokke
    anymore. My new Chars name is Ttegrus, I am a Woodelf Druid on the Mith. Marr server. If
    you see me feel free to stop and say &quot;hi&quot; or if you need help in a fight, I am
    more then willing to help. Just please don't expect me to tell you where all the things
    are on this page, becuase just like you I would have to look them up on here.&nbsp; <strong><u>Ttegrus</u></strong></p>
    <p align="left"><u>5.10.99</u> Greets friends and travelers. I have just updated a few of
    the items sent to me. You will find new items in the <a href="magicrobes.htm">Robes</a>
    section and the <a href="magicrjewelry.htm">Jewelry</a> section. I do have more items to
    add, but am going to add more tomorrow and the next day. I plan on adding a Lore section
    for the show casing of Lore items. I will however <u>not</u> be relieving the location of
    these items. I am also flirting with the idea of adding a section for spell research
    items. But if I do add this new section it will be more or less just a list of items used
    in spell research, no locations on these either. Also concerning many of the emails I have
    gotten about the locations of items, to put it simply if I don't have one listed for an
    item I don't know it. In many cases the location of the item was posted but the person(s)
    needed to hit refresh, so please remember to do that. In closing I have to thank those
    that have sent in Items to have posted. While not all of them made it in this update you
    will see them added of the next week. Also i know I said that I would start listing the
    names of those that sent me items, well I am not, simply because there would be too many
    to list.&nbsp; <u><strong>Brokke</strong></u></p>
    <p align="left"><u>5.1.99</u> I have finished adding all the updates I have. The sections
    that have new items are Slashing, Armor, Blunt, Jewelry, Piercing and Misc. I have yet to
    see any Magic Robes, so please send pics of those in. As of right now I am completely
    caught up with adding the items you wonderful people have sent me. If you sent me an item
    and I didn't post it, that probably means you were one of the many people that sent me
    non-magical items. A heart felt thanks goes out to all those that sent in items. I am
    going to start list those people that do send me items, but only their online name, as I
    do not like listing real names. If you do not wish me to list you then please let me know.
    If you have any comments please let <a href="mailto:cybermurray@moltenlava.com">me</a>
    know. <u><strong>Brokke</strong></u></p>
    <p align="left"><u>5.1.99</u> I put about half of the total items for this update in this
    morning. I will finish the update tonight. The areas I updated are Armor and Jewelry.
    Tonight I'll be added alot more jewelry and also about 3 piercing. One other change I made
    was at the top of the item pages with more then one page, I added links to all the pages.
    Hope you like the update, and keep those comments and updates coming. <u><strong>Brokke</strong></u></p>
    <p align="left"><u>4.29.99</u> Greetings. Sorry for the lack of updates yesterday, I had
    out of towners here to visit. Tonight I worked on a total rework of the page, I hope you
    all like the new look. Let <a href="mailto:cybermurray@moltenlava.com">me</a> know what
    you think. Oh thank you to all that have been sending me updates and new items, its your
    help that makes this possible.&nbsp; I also have to say I'm sorry to those very same
    people because I haven't gotten to post what you've sent me. Tomorrow I'm not going to do
    anything except add items. So look for new Items tomorrow night. -<strong>Brokke</strong>.....PS
    with all the changes happening remember to hit the refresh button often. </p>
    <p align="left"><u>4.27.99</u>&nbsp; I just did a BIG update. But the info I have gotten
    is not complete, I got to take the pics of these items, but the owners would not tell me
    where they got them. Enjoy and let me know if you have any info on those pieces missing
    it. ***Updated slashing, piercing and armor***</p>
    <p align="left"><u>4.27.99</u> I submitted this page to EQvault for the news section. I
    also posted the list on the Mith Marr msg board, and the Mith Marr mailing list. The first
    day we received over 100 hits. </p>
    <p align="left"><u>4.25.99</u><big> </big><font color="#ebbe0e" size="3">Grogg (Mukala
    ,Gnukk or what ever personality is dominant at the time ) sent me the first update for the
    Items pages, What he sent me was the Jade Ring, an Item he made himself. Thank You, Ol'
    Buddy. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><u>4.24.99</u> The Items pages has been recreated, thanks to an awesome
    suggestion by RaesAngel. Also thanks to Raes we have our first entry...The LockJaw Tunic. </p>
    <p align="left"><u>4.23.99</u> Items page created. All text format. </td>
