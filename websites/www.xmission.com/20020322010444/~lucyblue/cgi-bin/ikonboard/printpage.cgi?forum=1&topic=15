        We desperately need a dog park down south. Please write your local congressmen to show your support. A public hearing is scheduled for November to talk about this subject. Please please please, write and let them know how valuable dog parks are and that there is a need for one south of Atherton Park in Taylorsville. Thanks!!!

        I just moved to Sandy from North Carolina. &nbsp;I am not sure who I need to write to petition a dog - off leash park. &nbsp;Please send me names, addresses, phone numbers of the elected ones who can make this happen and I will be more than glad to chime in!
