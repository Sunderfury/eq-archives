        I set up the email features today. &nbsp;This should now be working *crosses fingers* &nbsp;so... when you register you will get an email confirmation. Also, if you forget your password, you should be able to click on the Forgotten Your Password link, and it'll be mailed to you. &nbsp;Comments appreciated! <br>Thanks <br>:)
