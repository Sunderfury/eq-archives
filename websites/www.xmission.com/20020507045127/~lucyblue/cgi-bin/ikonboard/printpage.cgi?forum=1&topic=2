        There was a small discussion about this on the ezboard. I thought it would be fun to redo the discussion here. <br> <br>Currently I drive a toyota pickup with a shell and the dogs ride in the back. &nbsp;Crates fit nicely in the back, and I also have a hitch so can pull a trailer. <br> <br>However, I was considering purchasing something like a Subaru Outback for my next vehicle. &nbsp;Still undecided, however.  <br> <br>What do you drive? &nbsp;:)

        We have a Subaru Outback. Robin loves it, he has a bed in back, chew toys, a water bowl... Even with all that he still likes to ride up front. &nbsp;Luckily he's not interested in sticking his head out the window. We have a seat belt harness for him too. &nbsp;We also hav an old van with a raised bed in the back we use for camping. &nbsp;Robin likes this best of all. &nbsp;I don't know if he's just thinking there may be a chance we'll just keep going to the mountains, or if he likes looking out the window down on everyone.
