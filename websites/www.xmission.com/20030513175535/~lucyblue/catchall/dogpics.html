My heart breaks when I say Kip crossed over the rainbow bridge at 8:15, Saturday
morning, April 29, 2000.  He was the best friend a person could ever have, and I'll
always miss him.  Thanks for visiting his page.

web page all to myself.

I have been camping often, swimming in lakes, and have had rescued dogs 
(strays, greyhounds etc) in and out of my life on a regular basis.  
Greta, a guide dog in training, left us to go to 'puppy college' on May 19th, 
1998.  She graduated in December 1998 and is now living with a person in Las Vegas, 
Nevada.   Now I have a new sister, her name is Lucy and she is a smooth blue collie.  I also have a new brother,
Levi, he is also a smooth blue collie.  She is very clumsy but I like her okay.

My Mom found me when I was a year old.  I lived at one of her old boyfriend's houses and 
I was not a very happy dog.  I lived in an old dog run, and once a day I would be let out 
to run around.  And I ran as fast as I could and jumped in the canal and wanted everyone 
to play with me, but I was so crazy about being let out that those people didn't want to 
have anything to do with me... until my Mom came along.  I didn't want to
go back into that dumb ol' dog run, so the guy went in with me with my food.  And I was 
hungry so I followed him in.  I knew he was gonna do it, but I was hungry so I followed 
him in and began to eat.  Then he'd close the door and climb out of the dog run, to leave 
me for the rest of the next day.

It was not a good time.  But then my Mom came along and took me away to live with her. 
She showed me how fun camping was, and swimming, and playing with other dogs.  Sometimes 
she runs around with me or gives me wierd toys, but I don't know what to do with them.  
She tells me I never learned how to play, but I sure love running through the woods and 
playing with other dogs and having a good time.  And she says that is good enough.

That pictures is one of my sister Greta laying in the sun.  She even likes to lay in front 
of the heater vent in the winter.  She's strange!

I am now 14 years old ( I was born in 1986 ) and while ago I lost my eardrum in my left 
ear.  I like to play in the field and I got a weed in my ear, and the doctor had to take 
it out.  My Mom doesn't let me play in the field anymore, and when I hear her she talks 
so soft... the doctor also said I'm loosing my hearing 'cause I'm getting a little old, 
but my Mom still cuddles me like I was a puppy.

I like to lay around all day now, I don't run around as much as I used to.  But I love
 our big yard and camping and I like to sail on the sailboat my Mom just bought. 
 It is fun because I get to lay around and watch the water go by.  Whew the water on the
Great Salt Lake sure tastes awful!

Greta has gone to guide dog puppy college and I miss her.  But with 
<a href="lucy.html">Lucy</a> here everythings is pretty fun, because she is a puppy
and runs around and chews on my ears.  I kinda look at her 
funny and bark at her sometimes, but maybe eventually I'll
play with her.  She is very cute.
