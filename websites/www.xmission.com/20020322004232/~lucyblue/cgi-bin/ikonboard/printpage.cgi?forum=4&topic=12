        Reprinted from email: <br> <br>"Hello all--  <br> <br>Well, I'm behind a bit, as you might guess!  After the ASCA trials, I spent the remainder of Saturday and Sunday at PetsMart doing an Adopt-a-thon (we adopted out ten animals and had a beautiful eight-week-old kitten stolen on Monday) and taking care of Jessica, my niece.  It took a bit to catch up, and, of course, there's always work to blame my tardiness on!  <br> <br>On to the news!  <br> <br>The ASCA Fun Match on 6/20/01 was alot of fun, and everyone got a good workout.  We had great judges and lots of people to work with!  <br> <br>The ASCA Trials were a great success, too!  The qualification rate was astounding!  I know some of the successes were a result of our two great Judges, Frank Komatar and Mel Stanley, and they were challenged by some great working dogs there!  <br> <br>On Saturday 6/23/01--  <br> <br>      Eleven of thirteen dogs entered qualified.  <br>      HIT 'Other Breed' went to Art Bell's Terv, Surya  <br> <br>On Sunday 6/24/01--  <br> <br>      Nine of Fifteen dogs entered qualified.  <br>      HIT 'Other Breed' went to Art Bell's Terv, Orly  <br>            Mel did an amazing thing--he had a three-way tie for HIT 'Other  <br>Breed'!  <br>      HIT 'Aussie' went to Marlene Warner and Will  <br> <br>The show site was immaculate, the weather was very friendly and a bit breezy, and the homemade cookies that I brought needed milk, although there were no crumbs left by Sunday!  <br> <br>The UKC show in Burley, ID, is coming up.  Remember it's a two-trial one-day show on 7/7/01, with Mel Stanley as the Judge.  You can earn two legs under the same Judge, so the day could be very productive!  If you need information  <br>on entries, please let me know ASAP, as they are limited due to time constrictions.  <br> <br>Deb Nendell and The Boys <br>DEBSAMPEP@aol.com"
