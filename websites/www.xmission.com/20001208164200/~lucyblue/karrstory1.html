The fire drake searched for her.  She could smell its breath, hear the beat of its 
wings on the wind as it remained aloft, hovering a few feet above the earth.  Her hair 
danced with the movement of the air.  She didn't move.  Her arms were covered with 
goose bumps, her heart was in her throat, and her knuckles were white as she held her 
staff with a death grip.  It had come upon her suddenly, perhaps defending the puma she 
had been facing.  Perhaps looking for a magician for its next meal.  Regardless, it was 
upon her now, and all she could do was keep her earth elementalkin close at her side and 
pray to the goddess to banish it.

Karranza bit her lip and closed her eyes, extending other senses, hoping it would 
disappear without taking her as its meal.  A shudder ran through her and she cursed 
herself.  What was she doing in these mountains anyway?  Was it to prove herself?  Was 
it to keep Trannin back home from calling her a coward?  Most likely.  Now, however, it 
didn't matter.  Weary from fighting the puma, her mana nearly exhausted, all she could do 
was hide behind the boulder and pray.  She was too far from the caverns which were too 
small for it to enter.  If she ran, it would grab her in claw and render her with its 
terrible beak.  Her elementalkin would be of little use, as two swift strokes and it 
would, also, be dead.

She needed the experience, she needed the practice, and this place was the prime area, 
for many of the creatures here often attacked nearby villages and travelers.  However, 
she didn't know enough spells yet. She should have taken someone with her.  Someone like 
Trannin with his sword… but she stifled an angry laugh.  He would only have mocked her.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the drake squealed, the noise raising the hair on the back of her neck.  
Her elementalkin even noticed, and would have run from behind their rocky sanctuary 
had she not kept a tight magical leash on it.  Her heart pounded faster.  Karranza 
expected it to round the rockface any minute, for surely the squeal was the sign of 
finding its prey.  But after a few moments it didn't come, and the squealing continued.  
Pain.  It was in pain.  She heard the grunt of a spellcaster and hope, which she had 
recently stopped feeling, reemerged in her heart.

Grasping her staff she crept from behind the rock.  He was beautiful.  A cleric, she 
could tell by his armor, by the spells he cast.  She stood and watched for some time, in 
awe, as he toyed with the drake.  The monster grew angry.  It should have run, should 
have known in an instant it was bested.  However, it remained, its unnatural foolish pride 
keeping it from fleeing to safety.

The cleric was clad in silver mail, straight and tall, his skin reflecting the light of 
the sun.  His hair, only a few strands showing from beneath his helm, was brown and 
gently curled.  His skills were beyond any she had before seen, and she stood in the 
open, her mind no longer thinking, for she was vulnerable not only to the drake, but to 
a number of other creatures which prowled these mountains.  She was unaware.  Her 
elementalkin took off, of its own accord, and proceeded to stab the drake.  It was 
then the cleric noticed her, and, from the corner of his eye, smiled at her.  Her heart 
leapt into her throat, and she could have fainted right then and there.
</p>

<p>
As the drake shrieked in pain and anger the cleric met her gaze, unafraid.  "Would 
you like the kill?"  he asked.  The corners of his mouth nearly turning up into a smile.
</p>

<p>
She heard his voice easily over the screeching drake, but didn't think to wonder why.  
Instead she gathered herself up, remembered who and where she was.  She lifted her chin 
in the highest elven fashion she could manage under the circumstances.
</p>

<p>
"I would," she replied and nodded, turning to the drake.
</p>

<p>
Her elementalkin was still stabbing at the beast as she gathered the remaining tatters 
of her mana and began to cast.  She felt stronger suddenly, and knew the cleric, as 
clerics were wont to do, had cast his own spell upon her.  Her fear subsided.  The drake 
was tired now, about to turn and run, its fear and self preservation finally taking over 
its anger.  Before it could, however, she felt the magic flow through her, course through 
her chest and arms, fill her mind with its wonder and beauty, and she cast at the drake.
</p>

<p>
One final screech and it fell.  A loud crash and a cloud of dust rose as it hit the 
ground.  Wings flailing about, the elementalkin still hacked at its corpse.  One 
wingtip twitched, then it was still.  Her elementalkin stopped its attack and regained 
its position by her side.
</p>

<p>
She took a deep breath, a sudden cold feeling creeping through her chest.  She nearly 
fell, exhausted, knowing she would have died had he not rescued her.  And how beautiful 
he was!  The most handsome high elf she had ever seen.  He stood tall and proud, his 
armor obviously his pride and joy.  His skills honed to a precision she thought she may 
never achieve.
</p>

<p>
As he approached her he removed his helm.  She had not seen many high elves with curls 
such as his, or eyes as deep as a forest.  As he looked at her she nearly melted.  She 
knew she was showing her youth, her fascination, her innocence, all the things Trannin 
kidded her about. But this elf, this cleric, there was nothing in his eyes but genuine 
joy.
</p>

<p>
"Fray," he said to her and offered a small bow.  One almost deserving of a princess.
</p>

<p>
Her voice stuck in her throat a moment.  She cleared it, and nodded.  "Karranza.  
I thank you for your aid.  Surely I would have lost my life, had you not come by.  
Is there any way I can repay you?"
</p>

<p>
"It was my pleasure.  I do not come through here often," he knelt to the drake's corpse 
and removed a portion of wing with a small blade he carried, "but when I do I keep my 
eyes open for young elves.  Seems this is a good training ground, and you're not the 
first I've found in some danger."
</p>

<p>
The grace with which he moved caused Karranza's legs to grow weak.  He seemed to 
dance, each movement precise, each drawing of breath a magical dance.
</p>

<p>
"If you would allow, I would heal your wounds."
</p>

<p>
Again she had to swallow, and stop admiring him so very much.  "Yes, I would appreciate  
your help. I don't feel so well," and as if the words somehow commanded it, she nearly 
fell to the ground.  
</p>

He caught her with a swift movement and a strong arm.  "Here, we'll be safe for a 
while.  Sit, and relax."  With those words he stood near her and gathered his skills.  
He was a dream to watch.  He must be very highborn, she found herself thinking.  
The magic he called responded to him as though it was made for him.  As if all the magic 
in the world were there for his beck and call, forming itself just for him, and she 
could not imagine anything which might threaten him.  Ah, to have skills such as his, 
how would it be?  She could only dream of it.  Though the mage guild had told her she 
had the talent, and with perseverance she could achieve her potential. still, it was 
easier to remain in her home and  read the books.  Instead of going out into the world 
and practicing.  She didn't like the ice which crept up her spine when she left her 
home.  When she walked about town and suffered the jeers from the other mages.  Her 
mother told her it was only in her mind, but she knew better.  She was a laughing stock, 
and she'd prefer not to expose herself to such ridicule.

Fray cast a number of healing spells upon her.  Her wounds closed, her blood stopped 
flowing, and energy reemerged in her.  She closed her eyes and felt the strength as it 
coursed around her, drinking in the cleric's gift.  It was wonderful, and she thought 
she had never felt so good.  Can a cleric make one feel better than usual?  Do the 
healing spells resemble brushweed, which gives the illusion of a strength and serenity 
greater than one naturally possessed?  
</p>

<p>
It didn't matter.  When he was done she sat for a moment before opening her eyes. 
Feeling the sun on her skin and hearing Fray's breathing next to her as he sat.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she offered at last, knowing it was all she could offer, and that offering 
was so very meager.
</p>

<p>
"My pleasure."
</p>

<p>
"Will you be in Felwithe this eve?  I could offer you dinner at the house of my 
mother.  She is a very good cook."  Karranza offered him a smile.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her for a moment, his brown eyes seeming to examine her more closely than 
she had ever before been examined.  She almost turned away, but the pleasure she saw 
there gave her confidence, and she remained where she was.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't planning on Felwithe, but I would enjoy the company."
</p>

<p>
Karranza smiled then, and nodded.  "If you wouldn't mind, a companion on the way home 
would be appreciated."
</p>

<p>
Fray understood the meaning behind her words, the fear she didn't want to express, 
and merely replied, "I would enjoy the company."
