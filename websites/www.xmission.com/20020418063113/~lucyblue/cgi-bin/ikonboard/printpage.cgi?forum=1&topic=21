        I'm looking for help on promoting this site. &nbsp;What could be done to make it more active? &nbsp;Anyone have ideas? I think it could be a great resource for people in Utah looking for information. <br> <br>Comments about the site itself are welcome, too. &nbsp;Is it too slow? &nbsp;Does it need a facelift? <br> <br>Thanks!

        I think the site is great. &nbsp;I wish people would post more, but I can't talk, I come and look a lot but don't often post. &nbsp;As for getting more people involved, I'm not sure. &nbsp;Could you hand out 'flyer/invites' at dog functions? &nbsp;I've tried to get friends involved but they don't spend as much time on the internet as I do. &nbsp;How about our own doggie get together days at different parks? &nbsp;Robin and I are always up for playdays. &nbsp;I wish I had better ideas for you, sorry. &nbsp;But I really do love this site, it's at the top of my 'favorites'.

        Eeek I don't come here enough.  :) Thanks for your reply.  The fliers may be a good idea, perhaps at Vet clinics too.  When I first put this site up I went around to many websites and tried to promote it, but that didn't seem to work.  :)  I would love to do a dog-walk sometime in one of the parks in the city. That would be a lot of fun. <br> <br>There is also an Announcements Email List.. perhaps I can reannounce this site, to see if folks will visit.  :) <br> <br>PS.. It seems there may be a cookies problem here, I tried to log in and it wouldn't keep me logged in. If anyone else is having this problem please let me know: lucyblue@utahdogs.com. <br> <br>Thanks
