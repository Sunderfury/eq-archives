I have been involved in dog rescue for many years now.  I placed ex-racing greyhounds 
in homes, and I have often found a stray on the street and found a home for it.  
Even friends and relatives have been known to drop off a dog to me so that I'll find 
it a happy place to live.  This page has pictures of the dogs and cats I 
have fostered and a little story as to his or her personality.  Currently I foster for
<a href="http://www.caws.org">CAWS</a>, and I am very grateful for everything they do for me. Please 
come back often to see how the fostering page is going.  Thanks!

The above picture is of Tucker.  Tucker is a smooth tri colored collie who is up for adoption as of June 2000.  He is a 
very sweet boy though has most likely been abused. He is very shy and afraid, but is very
loving and likes attention.

Tucker was found in Ogden in a hotel parking lot.  He now has all his shots and has
been neutered.  I hope he will find a loving, great home.

This is a Bria, she is a lab mix, with one blue eye and one brown.  She taught
Lucy how much fun barking is... but not fun for the people. :)  She was born in about 
March of 1999. She is a very sweet girl who I fostered in August of 1999.  
She was adopted by a very loving couple and lives in a fun new home.

Lucy and Bria just loved to lay on the couch.  Bria came camping with us to Goblin Valley,
and also taught Lucy how to dig.  Mostly Lucy just watched in amazement at her strange
behavior.
