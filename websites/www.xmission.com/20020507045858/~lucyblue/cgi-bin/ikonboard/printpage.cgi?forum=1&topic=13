        I set up a web cam today to spy on my dogs.  See what they are actually doing during the day that creates such a mess when I get home.   <br> <br>Anyone else have web cams?  I just think they are fun.  :) <br> <br>Click Below: <br><a href="http://www.xmission.com/~lucyblue" target="_blank">Lucy and Levi on the Web Cam</a> <br>

        Very cute. &nbsp;My husband wants to put one on Robins collar so we can see what he's looking at all day. &nbsp;Most likely it would be buried in a pillow on the couch!
