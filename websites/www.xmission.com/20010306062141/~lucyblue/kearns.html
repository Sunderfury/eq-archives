           On Saturday, March 19, Kip, Lucy, Levi and I went to visit Atherton Park.
           We hoped we would find many dogs and people, and we were lucky.  There was
           a Rhodesian Ridgeback, a couple pugs, some Dalmatians, and a few labs, not
           to mention many others.  It was a great variety, and we took these 
           pictures. </p>

           Atherton Park is a completely fenced in area which has been designated for the
           exercise of dogs and their people.  It is located at 815 West and 4500 South.
           At just about any time during the week you will find lots of people and their
           dogs running about, playing with each other, and having a good time. </p>
          </td>
          <td>
           <img src="images/utahdogs/atherton/atherton4.jpg" alt="Atherton Park">

           The park includes such amenities as benches for people to sit on, water
           hoses and buckets for the dogs to drink out of, and even a few fire hydrants 
           for the dogs to use at their discretion.
           The fact that it is fully fenced is ideal for the safety of
           the dogs, as 4500 South, which is just over the fence, usually 
           has heavy traffic which would otherwise be dangerous to the dogs.  Also, there
           is a double-gated entrance, which makes it more difficult for any dogs to
           escape unsupervised.  If the dog gets out one gate, there is yet another to
           keep them enclosed. </p>

           Lucy and Levi are in the picture to the right.  They were happily chasing a
           border collie who was chasing a ball.  Since Lucy and Levi are collies, they
           don't have much of the retriever instinct, but they have a great deal of the
           herding instinct.  Levi was a little shy and stuck around either myself or
           Lucy, but he's coming out of his shell. </p>

           The name of the Rhodesian Ridgeback (left) is
           Fenris Troubleson of Highgate, but his people just call him Fenris.  He is
           a very sweet dog, and was very interested 
           in the hotdogs I  had in my pocket. I use them as training aids for Lucy and 
           Levi and Kip, and
           the other dogs could easily smell them. Also, one of the Dalmatians kept
           hanging around me, as he snuck his nose in when I gave a hot dog to Lucy, and
           sucked up a bit himself.  I guess I made an inadvertent friend! </p>

           As you can see from the picture on the right, all the dogs would gather around
           people who advertised their treats.  This lady had a whole bag, and Lucy's
           tail is visible to the left most of the picture. She wanted to get her share!
           All in all, Atherton Park is a great, safe place to take your dogs for a run
           and for some excellent socialization with other dogs. Of course, small puppies
           should not be exposed to any high dog traffic areas until they have most of
           their vaccines. Please consult your veterinarian for when it's okay to 
           bring your puppy. </p>
