I have been involved in dog rescue for many years now.  I placed ex-racing greyhounds 
in homes, and I have often found a stray on the street and found a home for it.  
Even friends and relatives have been known to drop off a dog to me so that I'll find 
it a happy place to live.  This page has pictures of the dogs and cats I 
have fostered and a little story as to his or her personality.  Currently I foster for
<a href="http://www.caws.org" target="_blank">CAWS</a>, and I am very grateful for everything they do for me. Please 
come back often to see how the fostering page is going.  Thanks!

Sydney is a shy, cute, Shepherd Mix. I think she has some Rottweiler in her, too.
I got Sydney on February 13th, 2002, as the person fostering her took a 3 week
vacation.  She is very sweet and is getting along with Lucy and Levi great! I hope
she finds a good home soon.

Rosie is a red healer mix I fostered in the summer of 2001. Rosie had so much energy
she tired Lucy and Levi out.  She will need a home who can keep up with her, and who 
also has the time to work with her.  She is very sweet and loving and will follow anyone
from room to room.

The above pictures are of Tucker.  Tucker is a smooth tri colored collie who was up for 
adoption in June 2000.  He is a very sweet boy though has most likely been abused. He 
is very shy and afraid, but is very loving and likes attention. Tucker was found in 
Ogden in a hotel parking lot.  He now has all his shots and has been neutered.  Tucker 
found a wonderful home with a loving family, and is now very happy!

This is a Bria, she is a lab mix, with one blue eye and one brown.  She taught
Lucy how much fun barking is... but not fun for the people. :)  She was born in about 
March of 1999. She is a very sweet girl who I fostered in August of 1999.  
She was adopted by a very loving couple and lives in a fun new home.
