Written 14 April 2000
</p>

<p>
Felwithe was rather quiet when they returned.  Karranza was full of renewed energy, 
her wounds having been completely healed by the cleric's skills.  Perhaps she should 
have been embarrassed, to have been rescued, too near to death than she wanted to 
remember.  If the cleric had been only as experienced as her, or less, or a mage the 
same, then embarrassment might have covered her.  But Fray was obviously a very 
experienced cleric, one possessing skills beyond any which now lived in Felwithe or 
often traveled through.  Instead she was proud to have him by her side, as he chose 
her as companion.  Though Felwithe was his city of origin as well, she had never heard 
of him, as he must have left long ago.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set before they had even neared the city, and the streets were dark as 
she showed him to her home.  His gaze took in each and every bit of the town.
</p>

<p>     
"How long has it been?"  She asked him as they walked through the quiet streets.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.  "Nearly a century now.  I've traveled past many times, but 
never had a reason to stop in."  He glanced at her and smiled, that glow still 
in his eyes.  "It's good to be home."
</p>

<p>
They passed a few elves on the streets, and a few other races which 
frequented the town.  No one Karranza knew, however.  They reached her 
home quickly and she opened the door for him.
</p>

<p>
"Mother, is dinner ready? I've brought a friend."
</p>

<p>
Their house was sparsely furnished, but comfortable.  The warm wooden 
walls held the memories of births, deaths, holidays, and celebrations. 
Of sorrows and sicknesses.  Of long days spent studying, children playing, 
and the last days of the elderly.  The home had been built many centuries ago, 
reinforced with both magic and physical labor.  It held up well, kept the rain 
out, and was comfortably decorated.
</p>

<p>
Lillianth F'aebourne exited the kitchen with a wet dish in her hand and glared 
at her daughter.  The woman showed her age, which was rare for an elf, and suggest 
a great many centuries had gone by for her.  "Where have you been, child?  Dinner 
is cold."  The woman looked at her daughter, glanced at the man with her, then 
back at her child.  "Where have you been?"
</p>

<p>
"Only to the Steamfont Mountains, to kill a puma or two."
</p>

<p>
"And a fire drake," Fray added.
</p>

<p>
Any reprimand Lillianth might have uttered stuck in her throat, and she stared 
at Fray for a moment.  "And who might you be?"
</p>

<p>
The cleric stepped up and offered her a bow, even lower than the one he had given 
Karranza.  "Fray, Shield Bearer of the House Guard.  Guild Ilsik Haucil.  I am at 
your service."
</p>

<p>
Lillianth stared at him.  The color drained from her face suddenly, and the 
dish in her hands nearly hit the floor. She swallowed, hard, and finally blinked.
</p>

<p>
"It is my honor, Fray of Ilsik Haucil," and she curtsied lower than Karranza had 
ever seen her mother curtsey before.
</p>

<p>
Karranza, confused, lowered her eyebrows at her mother.  "You know Fray?"
</p>

<p>
Lillianth put on a mask of pleasure, yet Karranza could see the glare she 
focused on her daughter.  She turned back to Fray to answer. "The name is 
well known, not only here but throughout the entire land.  To have you in my home 
is a great honor. My home is small and humble, not worthy your title or your person.  
I would not be surprised if the cleric guild would have a more suitable rooms for you 
during your stay, if you would prefer."
</p>

<p>
"I would love to dine and room with Karranza and her exquisite mother, 
Lillianth F'aebourne.  If you would allow."
</p>

<p>
Lillianth blushed at the compliment, her pale embarrassment colored with a pink glow.  
"If it pleases you, I hope my home is adequate."
</p>

<p>
"Lillianth, your home is more plentiful than the one I grew up in, I assure you.  
I would appreciate if you considered me for who I am, instead of for what the 
storytellers say."
</p>

<p>
The elven woman nodded, and tried to smile, but her face remained pale.  
"Of course, Mer Fray.  By all means."
</p>

<p>
The dinner Lillianth prepared was composed of stew and fresh peas, as well as warm 
bread straight out of the oven.  They chatted about Felwithe and the changes it had 
undergone since Fray had last visited.  The cleric offered what spells he could to 
strengthen their home, and Lillianth accepted graciously.
</p>

<p>
The next morning when Karranza awoke she found her mother in the kitchen with a 
dreamy look in her eyes.  "Has Fray risen?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, hours ago, and already left.  He wanted to wish you well and tell you he 
would return when he could."
</p>

<p>
Karranza's heart sank, she had wanted to talk to him again.
</p>

<p>
"He wanted you to know that a friend of his was going to stop by Felwithe later 
tomorrow, one who is about as skilled as you, and needs practice at her craft.  
She is an enchanter, by the name of Frax, and she is a gnome."  Her nose twisted 
a bit at the last word, but she kept her comments to herself.
</p>

<p>
Karranza nodded.  "Well then, perhaps she'd hunt puma with me."
</p>

<p>
Lillianth gazed at her daughter, "then bring a skin back for me if you will, 
I have need of one."
</p>

<p>
*  *
</p>

<p>
The day went by slowly, and Karranza occupied herself with her studies.  
The books in the Mage Library was never ending, it seemed, and Dricknor, her tutor, 
was happy to assign her more reading.  She stared at the hand scribed black words on 
the white pages, her eyes heavy, her thoughts wandering to Fray.  If only she could be 
such as he, someday.  With her Elementals, she could have defeated the fire drake.  And 
then, perhaps, gone on to sharks, or giants… there were too many evil things in this 
land, and too many innocents threatened by them.  She opened her eyes and read, then, 
but promptly fell asleep in the gloomy library.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't long before she could take the money she had gathered from yesterday's 
kills and visit the local mage guild.  She would be able to purchase more spells, 
better spells, which would allow her to summon stronger elementals.  Elementalings, 
now, for with each day of practice she grew stronger and stronger.  These, along with 
other attack spells, would give her a definite advantage.  She was eager to begin using 
them.
</p>

<p>
The following day she woke late and dragged herself to the kitchen for breakfast.  
It was not long before there was a knock at the door.
</p>

<p>
She staggered towards it and opened it, the hinges creaking. She looked about for a 
moment, and saw no one.  Strange, she thought, what prankster was here? and nearly 
closed the door again.
</p>

<p>
When she heard a voice
</p>

<p>
"Hello," it said.
</p>

<p>
Karranza started, then looked down to where the sound came from.
</p>

<p>
A gnome stood at the door.  She was dark of hair and stubby of nose, and her green 
robes were dirty at the hem from where they had been dragged in the mud.  She held a 
staff in her hands and a frown on her face.
</p>

<p>
"Just like an elf," she said again, her stubby nose in the air.  "Only see what you 
want.  Humph."
</p>

<p>
The little gnome proceeded to enter the house, her robes tracking dirt on the floor.  
Karranza watched her for a moment then closed the door.
</p>

<p>
"But Mer Fray told me you'd be willing to hunt some goblins with me, and so here I am.  
With an open mind and an open stomach."  She smiled at her own joke, cocked her head, 
and waited.
</p>

<p>
"You,"  Karranza began, cleared her throat of sleepiness, and continued.  "You must be 
Frax."
</p>

<p>
"The one and only, Mes Karranza.  Enchanter by nature, gnome by birth, and Ilsik Haucil 
by guild.  If you're good, and you hold your own, maybe you'll win entry to a guild 
someday.  Until then…" Frax looked the high elf up and down, her eyes squinting.  "Well, 
you may have some work, but you may do.
</p>

<p>
"Have you any breakfast?  I've been traveling all night."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, of course," Karranza stuttered.  "Right here, in the kitchen."
</p>

<p>
The gnome followed her into the small room, hopped up on a chair sitting around the 
table, and leaned her staff against its back.  She folded her hands and stared at 
the elf.
</p>

<p>
"Eggs?  Or sweetcakes?"  Karranza had thought a gnome of higher stature would be Fray's 
friend, but she decided to give this little pipsqueak a chance.  She was the cleric's 
friend, and by being so must have some sort of honorable reputation.
</p>

<p>
"Both, if you will,"  Frax answered, a twinkle in her eye.
</p>

<p>
Karranza grumbled to herself, hoping the sound didn't carry. Or, when she thought 
again, perhaps it was better if it did.
</p>

<p>
Conversation tended towards studies and homes and goblins.  Frax was an enchanter only 
slightly less experienced than herself.  How could she then have gotten into a guild?  
Because of her friendship with Fray.  Jealousy burned in Karranza and she hoped her face 
didn't turn red with it.  However, Frax obviously had won some esteem with the cleric, 
for he wouldn't sponsor a young gnome such as herself without just cause.  Karranza 
lifted her chin into the air and set her teeth in determination.  To win Fray's 
confidence was something she must work toward. It would shame Trannin to no end, and 
Dricknor would either be proud of her, or jealous, she wasn't sure.  No matter, she would
 win Fray's favor, and today would be her first day.
</p>

<p>
When the gnome was finished with her meal she leapt off the chair and grabbed her 
staff.  "There is a goblin camp not far from here.  It's a scout camp, so not large, 
but an invading force could be on its way if we don't stop it.  Are you game?"
</p>

<p>
Karranza swallowed her fear.  "Yes, I am game.  Just let me change clothes will you?  
So I don't look like a complete unkempt dutz."
</p>

<p>
They left Felwithe well before midday.  As soon as they were free of the city 
Karranza summoned her earth elementaling from her new spells, then summoned a magical 
dagger to arm him with.  He was a brainless pet, obedient to her will, but she nodded 
to him and gave him a few words of encouragement and thanks for his presence. 
</p>

<p>
Frax, in turn, summoned her own pet, which was even more brainless than the earth 
elementaling.  However, they would form a good guard, good tanks, to take the brunt of 
any attack the spellcasters would encounter.  While the goblins were defending themselves 
from the pets, the spellcasters would bombard them with fiery attacks.
</p>

<p>
With a few magical shields to protect them, and their staffs held high in their hands, 
they followed Frax's maps to where the goblin camp was known to be.
</p>

<p>
Before they had even gotten close Karranza's elementaling grunted.  Then there was the 
sound of steel on steel, and both spellcasters turned.
</p>

<p>
"Damn," Frax uttered, glanced at Karranza, and then was taking action.
</p>

<p>
She was fast, Karranza noted, faster than she was herself.  No wonder Fray had sponsored 
her to his guild.  The half-decayed skeleton which had wandered out of the woods to 
attack the earth elementaling wore bits of torn flesh along with shreds of clothing.  
Murder and death were in its eyes, and pain and horror.  But the tanks hammered on it 
ruthlessly.  A knot formed in Karranza's throat but she swallowed around it, held her 
breath, and began her casting.
</p>

<p>
The power rose from the earth and responded to her will.  The new spells she had 
purchased were wonderfully more powerful than her last ones.  She thanked the goddess 
for such a wonderful feeling, and fire descended on the skeleton.  Had she been alone 
the skeleton would have defeated her.  But with Frax and two pets to act as tanks, the 
skeleton slowly weakened until its steel blade shuddered to the ground and all that 
remained was a pile of unbleached bones on the green forest understory.
</p>

<p>
Karranza finally released her breath, realizing she had been standing tense.  The muscles 
in her neck ached.
</p>

<p>
"Not a problem,"  Frax winked at the high elf.  "Alone, it would have killed either 
one of us."
</p>

<p>
"But not together,"  Karranza added.
</p>

<p>
"Not together,"  the gnome agreed.  "Fray was right, we make a good team."
</p>

<p>
They were more careful after that, though neither one of them had been injured, 
nor their pets.  The forest grew quieter as they traveled, and soon they were near 
the mark on the map which Frax pointed out with a finger containing much dirt under 
the nail.
</p>

<p>
"The one we have to worry about is the goblin wizard.  The rest of them our pets 
could handle on their own, but the wizard'll be a challenge by himself.  Unfortunately, 
when he comes out, the rest will follow, so we may have a hoard on our hands."
</p>

<p>
"Can we pick off the guards first?  Before the others know we're around?"
</p>

<p>
The gnome smiled, "yes, that'd be best.  If we can manage it without being discovered.  
We should still stick together, in case we're found out.  If we are, and we're separate, 
we'll die separately.  And Fray is too far off now to raise us if we died." 
</p>

<p>
"Do you know how many goblins are here?"
</p>

<p>
Frax shook her head, "Fray said between three and six, no more, no less.  But that's 
not including the wizard.  With him, seven.  But we should be okay if we use our brains,
not only our tanks."
</p>

<p>
A chill coursed down Karranza's spine.  She took a deep breath, said a short prayer, and 
wondered why she wasn't back in the safety of the library.  But if she ever wanted to 
join a guild this is where she'd have to be.
</p>

<p>
They didn't have to move to find the first goblin.  She kept her pet in control as the 
spindly being shuffled from behind a wide tree.  It's green skin was sparsely clad with 
some strips of cloth, and the smell that accompanied it turned Karranza's nose.  It's 
large eyes scanned the forest dumbly, and it didn't see the two spellcasters until it was 
too late.
</p>

<p>
Frax nodded to Karranza and she sent her elementaling off.  The pet attacked quickly, 
and was able to remain quiet.  The magical dagger it used slashed the goblin skin, 
tearing through flesh and drawing blood.  Soon after magic flashed, fire covered the 
goblin, and the enchanter's invisible pet was also slashing with it's own blade.  After 
only a short while the goblin hit the earth with a thud.
</p>

<p>
They all waited, silently, listening to the forest.  Wondering if another goblin would 
come.  It seemed they had been quiet enough, and were, for the moment, safe.
</p>

<p>
Frax moved quickly to the corpse and grabbed the bag of gold it had been carrying.  
"We'll split this later," she whispered, and moved off into the forest.
</p>

<p>
The elf followed the gnome, the pets taking up the rear.  If there were seven total 
goblins, then six were left.  Six at the most.  Karranza sucked in her breath, told 
her heart to stop beating so fast, and crept along behind.
</p>

<p>
They found another quickly, and dispatched it the same way.  Resting shortly between 
kills to allow their pets to recover, they sat in the forest and held their breath.  
Two dead, then three, then four.  Could there be more?  Could Fray have underestimated?  
But still, being attacked by two and a wizard that might better them yet.
</p>

<p>
The forest then seemed empty of goblins.  Gnome and elf exchanged worried looks.
</p>

<p>
"That's probably all the guard," Frax offered.  She looked more worried than she had been.
</p>

<p>
Karranza nodded,  "The camp, then?"  She was surprised the words didn't stick in her 
throat.
</p>

<p>
The enchanter nodded, mouthing the words <i>be careful</i>.
</p>

<p>
Karranza didn't need to reply, she knew the gnome saw her answer in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
They crept along toward the camp, peeking around trees and shuffling through the dense 
forest floor.  It wasn't long before the edge of a tent was visible through bushes.  
It was dark blue, and checkered, and it stank of rot.
</p>

<p>
Moving carefully they rounded the side of the tent, staffs at the ready, pet commands 
on the tips of their tongues.
</p>

<p>
They found what they were looking for.  The remaining three goblins stood in the middle of the clearing, and it seemed they were waiting for them.  All three stared right at them, snarling, their teeth bared.  The smell of them tainted the entire forest, and their growls echoed deeply in their chests.
"Get the wizard first,"  Frax whispered.
</p>

<p>
Karranza didn't wait, in a shock of panic and fear she commanded her pet.  The 
elementaling ran, dagger drawn, toward the  goblin wizard.  He was the only one 
clad in more than  rags, and already power licked at his fingertips.  Raw, bright, 
unearlthy magic covered him.  Karranza  found a scream in her own throat as she drew 
on her own power and cast at the wizard.
</p>

<p>
The goblin wizard's magic struck Frax first, as the gnome was closer than her.  
The enchanter staggered under the attack, weakened quickly, but didn't hesitate.  
She cast her own spells as the pets attacked.  As Karranza cast.  The goblin screamed 
in agony, unable to keep both spellcasters from attacking.  He cast again, this time at 
Karranza, and she felt the pain of the firebolt as it struck her.  Her knees buckled and 
she went down, while at the same time she cast again, and again, as much as she could, 
to drive that goblin into the ground.
</p>

<p>
As she was casting she felt the goblin warriors attack her.  Her shield spells held, 
however, and their blows were nothing which would weaken her.  For a while.  She had to 
concentrate on the wizard, he was the real danger.  If he was allowed to continue 
casting, then they all would be dead within moments.
</p>

<p>
The wizard screamed, his hands went into the air, and with a final bolt of lightening 
his skin caught fire and he was ablaze.  The forest air crackled with sizzling meat, the 
stench of rotting goblin.  Alight with the fire which consumed him.  It happened so 
quickly Karranza couldn't keep track, and with a sudden burst the goblin was gone, a puff 
of smoke all that remained from where he stood.  And then that, too, faded.
</p>

<p>
She shook herself from the mesmerizing fire and turned to the other goblin which attacked 
her.  Quickly she commanded her pet away from the remains of the wizard and onto the 
new threat.  The goblin switched its attention from her and onto the elementaling, as was 
her strategy, and with a few desperate blows and spells, that goblin, too, was down.  
Green blood spilled forth, and in what seemed a daze it was dead.
</p>

<p>
Karranza noticed she was still on her knees.  She would have tried to stand but her 
energy was spent.  She was cut from where the goblin had made it through her defenses, 
and her energy was drained from where the wizard had struck her.  Her pet stood beside 
her, and she checked its strength, too.  Down.  It was nearly dead.  Had it died... she 
didn't want to think about that.  Not yet. Not now.  Maybe not ever.  But they were 
alive, all of them, even if just barely.
</p>

<p>
Then she thought to look for Frax.  The little gnome sat nearby, panting, staring at 
her.  "A good fight, elf."  Her words were breathy, ragged, but there was a sparkle in 
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I think you are crazy, gnome."  But suddenly Karranza laughed, a musical sound, which 
brought the birds chittering back to the forest.  "But it was a good fight."
</p>

<p>
They spent the rest of the day in silence and slowly moving back to the city.  They 
didn't want to be stuck out in the forest with skeletons and who knew what else wandering 
around.  It was a dangerous forest, but with their help maybe it would become more safe.
After the sun had set and the sky was growing dark they made the city.  Frax had her own 
place to return to, and with a short farewell and a promise for more battles, she was 
gone.  Karranza wandered into the city on her own, finding her way home.
</p>

<p>
"Looks like you had a difficult fight," the voice caught her off guard and she spun to face its 
source, nearly falling with her weakness.
</p>

<p>
She looked straight into the cleric's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Fray,"  she managed, though her voice was a whisper.
</p>

<p>
Still he had that sparkle in his eyes.  Still his grip was strong on her arm.
</p>

<p>
"I was passing through and thought I'd stop in."  He smiled and let go of her arm.  
</p>

<p>
"This is for you,"  he handed her a red robe hemmed in yellow, and she could feel the 
strength in it.  She sucked in a quick breath.  Before she could thank him he scurried 
up the steps toward the cleric building.  She stood below and watched him, weariness 
consuming her.  His hands began to glow, his entire being lighting up.  Fire shot from 
his hands as he gathered the magic around him.  As she watched he healed her, and 
strengthened her, and wished her well.  In moments, it seemed, he nodded to her.  
Then he was gone.
</p>

<p>
She walked home and fell into her bed, ready for a good night sleep.  She dreamt of 
clerics.
