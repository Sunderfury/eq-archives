        The following is reprinted from email: <br> <br>"Hello!  <br> <br>It's been a long winter, and I'm not as quick as I should be this year, but I  <br>wanted to let you know that there will be a UKC Obedience Trial next month.  <br> <br>Dates are May 26, 2001, and May 27, 2001.  <br> <br>The show will be at Willow Creek Dog Training Center (time to be  <br>announced--I'll keep you posted).  <br> <br>Our Judge is Mel Stanley both days (UKC allows two legs under the same Judge).  <br> <br>I'll send you more information soon on times and costs and what we will be  <br>offering.  Expect goodies and nice trophies and ribbons!  <br> <br>If you would like to pre-register, please email me or call me at the number  <br>below.  UKC allows day-of-show entries, although the price will be higher.    <br>Remember that you will need to have your dog registered with UKC to compete.  <br> <br>If you know of someone who doesn't receive my updates and would like to,  <br>please let me know.  If you wish to be removed from the list or change your  <br>email address, please let me know.  If you have doggy news that you would  <br>like me to publicize, please let me know.  If you ........ (fill in the  <br>blank), please let me know, but keep it clean!  HaHa!  <br> <br>Happy training!  <br> <br>Deb Nendell and The Boys  <br>Sammy (C.G.C., U.D., ASCA-C.D., T.D.I.), Parker, John Henry  <br>and Pepper (C.G.C., T.D.I.), who will live in our hearts forever  <br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Trail/2248/index.html" target="_blank"> Utah Yorkie &amp; Small Dog Rescue </a> <br><a href="http://www.heartministries.com/" target="_blank"> <br>HEART Ministries, Inc. </a> <br>Magna, UT " <br>
