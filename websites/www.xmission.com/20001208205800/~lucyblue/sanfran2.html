While sailing we were repeatedly pushed along by
helicopters.  Each time they flew by the Ghost would
noticibly heel.  Going under the Oakland Bay Bridge
was fun.

The Oakland Bay Bridge is very high.  San Francisco is
a beautiful city.  We didn't realize how large the
bay was until we were out on it in our little boat.
Our Ranger 22 must have been one of the smallest boats
on the Bay.  But she handled the rough seas well.  
The huge container ships were easy to avoid, unless 
you were in that crazy sailboat we saw where the guy 
was riding on their bow wake.  Ouch!

We motored into Pier 39.  It was fun to come into
Fisherman's Warf from the Bay instead of driving in
like we usually do.

Sailing by Alcatraz was fun.  We looked for prisoners
in the water trying to swim for safety... but we could
not find any.  Oh, but I guess it's been many years
since it was an active prison.  :)

The Sea Lions floated in the water with their noses
in the air.  The first time one swam right by the
boat we thought it was a piece of garbage.  Wow, life
in the water!  That is very different from the Great
Salt Lake.  The only life we usually see is brine
shrimp.  Angel Island (above right) is a California
State Park and was very green.  We walked around
and considered staying the night.  However, the
next day's weather was uncertain, so we decided to
head back to Ballena Bay Marina.
