The Grey Ghost was brought home to be packed on Friday night,
October 9, 1998 for it's 400 mile trip to Lake Mead from
the Great Salt Lake.  The Grey Ghost is quite large on the trailer
and we were all nervous about driving her so far.  My little
toyota pickup was up to the task, however, and both trailered
Ghost and truck were reliable.

Driving to Lake Mead was less stressful than we had thought
it would be.  The trailer handled beautifully and we reached
65 mph with no difficulty.  We camped on Saturday night at the 
Echo Bay campground and waited to launch the Ghost and step the
mast on Sunday morning.  The mast went up fine, even though we
did not have a slip we could use.  We had to tie the Ghost up
to the courtesy dock so the back was angled in as much as
possible in order to stand on the dock to hold the mast.  Since
it was our first time stepping the mast (and Josh was not around
to help) we built our confidence and everything went right.

It was strange to look in the water and actually see fish!  So
they were carp, but they were not brine shrimp, so it was
different for us.  The first day was beautiful and we spinnakered
the entire day, travelling south.  The depth of the lake reached
200 feet easily and we were astonished, considering we are used
to a lake which usually has a maximum depth of 26 feet under 
the keel of the Ghost.  The first night we camped in Cathederal
Cove, a beautiful bay with tall rock walls.  The water was 
22 feet deep where we anchored, and we also tied off to the
shore because we were so close.  Cynthia was very nervous about
being so close to shore, but the anchors were solid and we 
had little wind and no waves in our bay.  It seemed like we
were sleeping on dry land.

Swimming was great in Lake Mead.  We didn't even have to shower
after to get two inches of salt off.  The weather was wonderful,
sunny and windy in the mornings, giving us an average of 4 knots.
And sunny and fairly still in the afternoons.  When it was
still we would swim to cool off, because it was so very warm.
