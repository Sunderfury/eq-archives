The spinnaker worked great, and so okay, we didn't have the
main up... but we are learning.

Cynthia is taking a rest at the helm in the above picture. Also,
we did see some other sailboats on Lake Mead, although they
were much more rare than the motor boats, houseboats, and
waverunners.

The large rocks were absolutely amazing, and we passed by
them so close it made Cynthia's heart skip sometimes.  But the
depth kept being deep.  The picture on the right is Cynthia
getting ready for bed in the bow of the boat.  Better than home
with all the comfy spreads and pillows.

A trip to the Las Vegas area would not be complete without a
side trip to Roger's Spring.  There were some convicts
swimming around, as well as guppies and a few mollies, and
Aaron spotted a turtle.  We took this trip on the way to
Las Vegas to play for a day. The Star Trek ride at the
Hilton was excellent, we highly recommend it... but we hope
the same thing doesn't happen to you that happened to us.
