This page will be a little about myself.  I have thought
in the past that these pages were tacky, but after reading a 
few of my friend's pages, and learning a little about them,
I changed my mind and thought I should add my own.  I hope no one is 
offended or will be chased off by who I am and what I like.  I do like making 
lots of friends with people who have all kinds of different ideas and beliefs and likes.
<P>
I was born in 1967 in Chicago, Illinois.  Most of my father's
family is still there, and it is fun to go and visit them and
explore the city.  I moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, when I
was seven years old and have lived here most of my life.  Oh no,
now you know how old I am.  Oh well, maybe I'm not old enough yet
for it to bother me.
<P>
My Mother was born in Slovakia and raised in West Germany.  She has many friends 
and relatives in Germany. My father's parents were born in Denmark, and he was born 
in Chicago. I am lucky to have the advantages of a culturally diverse background.

I have one sister, Chris, and she has a son named Sabastion.  He is a wonderful boy. 
I'm a programmer and have been since January 1998.  I love it, it is a wonderful job 
and I work with excellent, funny people.  In May 1999 I completed my schooling at 
received my Associate Degree in Computer Information Systems.
<P>
I am recently divorced, which breaks my heart. I have, however, learned a great
deal about myself due to this experience, and I hope I can grow and become a more
healthy person for it.  

<P>
I love to travel to the tropics, scuba
dive, and sail.

I have a few passions in life.  My first one is dogs.  
<a href = "dogpics.html">Kip</a>
has been with me since 1987 and has been my constant companion.
He has his own web page, so I guess I should have mine!  <a href="lucy.html">Lucy</a> is
another of my canine companions, as is 
<a href="levi.html">Levi</a>.  Both are smooth blue collies.  Lucy
 was born on February 15, 1999 and is a very sweet little girl.  Levi was born
on November 5, 1999. am big into
animal rescue and I will usually pick up a dog I find on the street and
try to find it's home.  I occasionally foster dogs and I am a strong
supporter of spaying and neutering because there are too many dogs and
not enough good homes. I was involved in greyhound rescue and placed
a number of exracing greyhounds into homes.  
A PetSmart article stated that to find a home
for every dog and cat each person would have to have 2 cats and 4 dogs.  
Please don't have puppies or kittens.
<P>
Another passion I recently discovered is sailing.  I started sailing in March of 
1998 and I cannot get enough.  I bought a Catalina 22 and named her Moon Shyne.

My third passion is my family and friends.  I love to spend time
with them, learn from them, and have fun with them.  And, of course, to sail with them.
<P>
I will also include some of my beliefs:  My passion for dogs extends to all animals, and, as <a href = "http://www.peta.com">PETA</a>
says: "Animals are not ours to eat, wear, or experiment on."  But I hope you don't consider me a fanatic because of this.  I'm just a regular person who doesn't eat animals.
The world is not here for our use, rather we live on it and
with it.  Humans should not be arrogant because we can build huge
buildings and machines.  Living in a forest or desert is
just as important. 
Humans can do anything, and someday we will be able to
travel at warp speed.  All people are equal.  I disagree with any prejudice, including a person's race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. I believe kindness should be given to all animals, human, canine, or other. I hope I am open minded, and I don't like to force my opinions on anyone.  I try to accept people for who they are.  I don't usually wear makeup, I don't usually dress up.  I'd rather be outside in nature being dirty.  Maybe I just never really grew up. In our modern society one of the most important things in life is what we <i>feel</i>. I love to be happy.  I love the Indigo Girls. Many of my beliefs are not traditional, but you'll have to get to know me to find those out.
Hey, I gotta have some secrets!
<P>

things to do is E-mail.  Have a great life!
