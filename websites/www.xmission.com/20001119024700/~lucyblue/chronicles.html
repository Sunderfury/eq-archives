Ilsik Haucil was formed by Tallion avu Winden Haucil, son to the House Winden Haucil.
After the disappearance of Tiffiaz, the patriarch of the house, and the discovery of his
obliterated remains, Tallion set out to punish those who had destroyed his father.
He left behind his mother Verasies and his sister Valkith.  He quickly lost contact with
both. His mother perished from the loss of her husband and son.
It is unknown where Tallion formed the guild, or to what purpose.  Only Valkith's
story is followed.  
</FONT>
</P>

<P>
<FONT class="small">
Valkith followed a rumor she heard of her brother's location and was able to discover
him once again.  Tallion had built a true and honorable guild.  However, after meeting with
his sister once again, he disappeared and left the guild without a leader.  
The guild fell into corruption and dishonesty.
</P>

<P>
<FONT class="small">
Ilsik Haucil remained, however, the Elven Standing Army in the lands, mercenary only
to maintain their costs, and obeyed the Queen of the Elves.  Valkith was able to win 
three divisions away from Ilsik Haucil's corrupt leadership.  After many years of 
ruling her own lands Valkith was captured by the Nar.  Here her persona was duplicated,
something she did not learn of until she was released.
</P>

<P>
<FONT class="small">
One of her duplicates was Moraganna Sofia Oriannius, who formed the Dark
Alliance.  It was then Valkith called on Ilsik Haucil for aid. Having won over
much of the leadership and many of the cavalry, Ilsik Haucil reformed under her
leadership, their sense of honor and valor returning to them. 
</P>

<P>
<FONT class="small">
It is unfortunate that Valkith has since disappeared, for her cause is just and her
honor valiant.  It came to a vote of the house to elect a new leader, and this
office was given to the Lord Onyx Tyrie, Rogue of the House Ilsik Haucil, now
titled Guildmaster.  Lord Tyrie and Cimmarose Jadefyre of House Winterblood
formed a treaty against the Dark Alliance.
