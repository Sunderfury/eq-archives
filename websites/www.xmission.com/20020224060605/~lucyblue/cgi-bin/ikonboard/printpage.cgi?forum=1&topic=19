        Reprinted from Millcreek Fidos Email: <br> <br>"This message is especially relevant to individuals who walk with their dogs on the Bonneville Shoreline Trail just East of Red Butte Gardens. <br> <br>I have an office which overlooks the start of this part of the Bonneville Trail. Every day this week my co-workers and I have observed elk, deer and moose grazing on and near the trail. They are even coming down to the area around our building. We have observed several encounters between dogs and wildlife in the past few days - probably at least 6 encounters a day. We have observed several instance when dogs have chased these animals over a considerable distance. I'm writing this email having just seen a dog and person spook a moose. The dog did not chase the moose, but the person and dog were within a few yards of the animal before either party realized the other was there. <br> <br>My assumption is that with the very heavy snow falls these animals are being forced to come down to lower elevations in order to find food. Please be very alert to possible wildlife, a close encounter with a moose is potentially dangerous for all parties. If you have a dog which you that you either know or suspect will chase wildlife please do not allow them off leash in areas where there have been recent frequent sightings of wildlife. I for one will not be walking my dogs off leash on the Bonneville Trail until the wildlife density drops. <br> <br>These animals are obviously uncomfortable with their proximity to humans and therefore we must assume that they are being forced to come into contact with us in their search for food. We need to respect their right to be here, and attempt to minimize the stress that we're causing them."
