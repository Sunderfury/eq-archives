        I discovered this link for one of the Yahoo Clubs I'm in (Droopy Dogs Pound). &nbsp; <br> <br>I have 2 dogs. &nbsp;I have a 3-year old female Akita/BorderCollie mix named Amy and a 2-year old male Husky/mix named Casper. &nbsp;Amy is red and white and Casper is white in the winter and a really pale tan in the summer. <br> <br>We (my wife and I) got both of them at the Humane Society in Salt Lake. <br> <br>I also have 2 Cockatiels. &nbsp;I have a 12-year old male named Chicken that has been with me longer than anyone, including my wife.. and a 3-year old female named Baby that we got for him a couple of years ago. <br> <br>Looking forward to chatting with you all. <br>Thanks,

        Hello.  :)  Your dogs and Cockatiels sound like a lot of fun.  I have only had limited experience with cockatiels, but they seem like fun to have around. <br> <br>Hey, and I browsed around yahoo clubs and looked at your info.  :)  Followed the link you posted to Trillian.  Wow that's excellent!  I loaded it up and put my ICQ, mIRC and AIM on there.  It's sooo much nicer than having all three programs running. <br> <br>The skins seem a bit flaky, though.  It is a fun program.  How did you discover it?
