On March 13, 1999, some friends and I
hitched the trailered Grey Ghost from
the Great Salt Lake South Shore Marina and drove 
towards San Francisco.  The above map shows where we
traveled.
</P>

<P>
We slept in Sacramento on Saturday night, and arrived
at Ballena Bay Marina (#2) on Sunday morning.  We 
were going to launch the boat that day, but we were 
advised
against doing so because it was low tide and the depth
 at the launch ramp was only about 3 feet, much too shallow for our 
4.5 foot draft.  So we toured the
town instead, and slept at a local hotel Sunday night.
</P>

<P>
On Monday morning we pulled the boat to the Grant 
Street Public Launch ramp (#1) and launched the Grey
Ghost onto the San Francisco Bay Estuary.  The weather
was quite nice, and after the boat was packed, and 
the mast was up it was so warm we took off some 
clothes.  We motored away from the launch ramp and 
put up the sails.  It was pretty narrow in the 
estuary but we wanted to have some fun anyway.  
Shortly after a large tug pulled by us our depth 
meter shot from 35 feet to 2 feet, and we were 
nervous.  However, we realized the 
wakes of some of the large vessels in the Bay 
screwed up our depth meter.
</P>

<P>
We sailed the Grey Ghost north and west through the 
estuary and south towards Ballena Bay Marina (#2).  
There were military maneuvers being conducted that 
day
and the coast guard stopped us twice to tell us to 
sail
west around the large aircraft carrier and destroyers 
instead of going between them and the east shore.  
The
waves were about 4 feet high and the wind was strong,
 with %35 jib and reefed main we made 6 knots to the 
Ballena Bay Marina.  We spent the night on the boat.
</P>

<P>
The next day, Tuesday, we toured San Francisco and 
went shopping around Alameda.
</P>

<P>
On Wednesday Dave Oswald joined our crew.  He took a
ferry from San Francisco (he was there on business)
and we picked him up.  We then sailed from the Ballena
Bay Marina (#2) up to Pier 39 at Fisherman's Warf (#3).
We did some more sight seeing of San Francisco and
Fisherman's warf, ate in a restaurant in
China Town (The Golden Dragon) and then wandered back
to the boat to sleep.
</P>

<P>
The next day, Thursday, we sailed from Pier 39 to
Angel Island, passing Alcatraz on the way.  Over
to our west we could see the Golden Gate Bridge,

but we were not willing to tackle the 5 to 6 knots
of current to sail the open ocean.  Perhaps we will
next time.  Angel Island (#4) was beautiful and very
greeen.  After walking around the island, we
motored south back to Ballena Bay (#2).  Unfortunately,
we picked the time of ebb tide.  Since the tide was
going out, we were fighting the currents the entire
way back to Ballena Bay.  Sailing would not have
been possible, as the current was so strong.  Our
knot meter read 5.5 knots, while Dave's GPS read
1.5 to 2.5 knots on the trip.  Sometimes (though he
didn't admit it at the time) the GPS read zero.  It
was a long trip!
</P>

<P>
During our motoring south to Ballena bay, we 
spotted a humpback whale, and many sea lions were
floating about in the water.  Also, when Dave
looked behind us at one time, the military stealth
ship was behind us.
</P>

<P>
It was an exciting trip and we hope to do it again 
soon.  As well as other trips.  Below is a picture
of the stealth military ship when it was docked.
