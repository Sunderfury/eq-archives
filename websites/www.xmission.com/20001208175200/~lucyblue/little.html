   Hi, I'm Little. I came to live with my 
   <a href="me.html">Mom</a>, 
   <a href="dogpics.html">Kip</a>, 
   <a href="lucy.html">Lucy</a>, and 
   <a href="levi.html">Levi</a> in January 2000.  The person
   who used to have me thought I was a calico siamese mix.  But after my Mom did some
   browsing on the web, she thinks I'm mostly 
   <a href="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/ragdoll.html">Ragdoll</a>. But she's not
   sure which.  It doesn't matter, though. I like to follow her around and I like to meow a
   lot.  The dogs are okay, but I'm not too sure about them yet. They just want to play and
   I'd rather snuggle.
   </p>

   <table>
     <tr>

      </td>
      <td>
       <font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS, Monotype Corsiva, Arial">
       I spend most of my time in the kitchen, separated from the dogs by a gate.  I
       get the kitchen and the downstairs, while the dogs look at me funny.  But I keep
       them away.  Sometimes, when I'm feeling brave, I'll sleep on the couch while they
       are walking around, but I'm not too sure about them yet.

       My Mom's never had a cat before, so I'm showing her all the ropes.  She feeds me
       canned food but sometimes I don't like the kind she gives me.  I just don't it eat,
       and she's pretty good at giving me some better stuff.  I like the kitchen table,
       and I'm usually either on top of it or snuggled below on one of the chairs.
