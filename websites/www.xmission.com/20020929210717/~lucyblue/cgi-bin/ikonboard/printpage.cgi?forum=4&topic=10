        WAG is an Agility club open to anyone. &nbsp;There are no classes, no big fees, just lots of fun. &nbsp;They are having a playday in the park Saturday June 23, &nbsp;1100am at Fairmont park (north west end of the park). &nbsp;It's $5.00 per family for all your dogs, as many times through as you'd like. &nbsp;If you're a &nbsp;first timer there are some great trainers there that are willing to help you with whatever you need. &nbsp;If you'd like more info e-mail &nbsp; Uswag@aol.com
