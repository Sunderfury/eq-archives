        Where can you go off leash in Butte Gardens? &nbsp;I've been to the gardens and have never seen a sign about dogs. &nbsp;I've e-mailed them asking for info but have never gotten a reply. &nbsp;Is there a park near it or can you really take your dog into the park you pay to go into. &nbsp;If so, there would be some great photo ops!!!

        The Off Lead area is to the south of the Gardens.. You can't go inside with your dog (as far as I know).  I haven't been up there in a while, but I think to the south there is a bike/walk path that kinda goes along the hillside.  Walking up that there will be lots of people, and many of them take their dogs up that way, too.   <br> <br>Hope that helps.  :p <br>Cyn
