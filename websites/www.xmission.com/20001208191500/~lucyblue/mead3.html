We traveled to Burrow Bay (fondly renamed Burrow Boy) on the
second night.  Again the weather was clear and the swimming
nice, though a bit chilly.

We sailed out of Burrow Boy easily the next morning, the winds
were just right and we decided we didn't need the motor.  We
traveled east and north, back up to Cathederal Cove for the
third night.  There were a few mosquitoes but it was not bad
at all.

On Thursday night we camped in another sheltered bay, the
name escapes me now.  We were rocked and rained on, the south
tip of the storm which threw six inches of snow on Cedar City
hit us.  But not much.  It left us the next morning with gusty
winds up to 35mph.  We tried to sail out of the bay, but the
winds were flaky and we ended up motoring back into the
heart of the lake.  We considered reefing the main, as the
winds were high and so were the waves.  We decided instead to
sail on only the 35% jib.  It was a good choice, for we were
reaching 6 knots on only the 35%.  It was a great ride, the
waves were reaching 5 feet high, but the sky was clear and
sunny, and although we were chilled by the wind we had a 
wild ride.  Unfortunately one of the crew caught some sea
sickness and spent the day recovering.  However, it was a
fun ride and we'd do it all over again!
