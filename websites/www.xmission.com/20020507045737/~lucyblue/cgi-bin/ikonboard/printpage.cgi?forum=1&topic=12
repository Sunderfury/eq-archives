        Hi. &nbsp;Mattie and I are looking to escape Mill Creek. &nbsp;I know that the Cotttonwoods are watersheds, and off limits. &nbsp;Are there any restrictions in the Uintas? &nbsp;Arches or Zion? &nbsp;Flaming Gorge? &nbsp;I'm new to the area, but I want to expand my Belgian Malinois' horizons. &nbsp;Thanks for any info.

        Hi Roy and Mattie. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>I love taking my dogs to the Uintahs. &nbsp;I'm pretty sure they are supposed to be leashed near roads and in camp grounds, but the Uintahs are full of back-country area where you can pull out a stretch of land and let the dogs run. &nbsp;One of my favorite places is Elizabeth Pass. &nbsp;At 10,000 feet it can get kinda cold, and sometimes the mosquitoes are nasty, but there is a little pond in the middle, trees on the rims to camp under, and the stars are beautiful. &nbsp;It's closer to Evanstan than Salt Lake, though. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>Lemme know what you find. I am always looking for new places to go, too.
