        Reprinted from email: <br> <br>"There are some wonderful Holidays coming up, and our animal rescue group, HEART Ministries, is offering you something special for your holiday season!  We're going to be taking holiday portraits (with or without Santa) as a fundraiser/public service!  We can include whole families and any pets, or any combination you wish.  This is a perfect time to think about special gifts and holiday cards! <br> <br>This is a very special setup this year.  We are offering digital photos on diskette for you to have processed in a number of ways: <br> <br>       Photographs           3x5, 4x6, 5x7, 8x10 <br>       Calendars               Picture-a-month, Deluxe 12-month laminated <br>       Greeting Cards        Includes envelopes <br>       Mugs <br>       T-Shirts/Sweatshirts <br>       Computer Sets        Mouse pad, Screen Saver, Wallpaper, Cursor, Icon <br> <br>The cool thing is that if we take care of the special processing, the company we are working with will make a great donation to our group; however, you can take the pictures and have them done yourself if you wish. <br> <br>We're currently confirmed at the following places and dates and times: <br> <br>Willow Creek Dog Training Center <br>2055 East Creek Road <br>Salt Lake City <br>November 24, 2001, from 9:00a.m. to 2:00p.m. <br> <br>PetsMart <br>1830 South 530 West <br>Salt Lake City <br>December 1 and 2, 2001, from 9:00a.m. to 5:00p.m. <br>Also can include a Polaroid picture/ornament <br> <br>(More times/places are being scheduled) <br> <br>Our prices are going to be very reasonable, too!  First photo is $5; second and consecutive photos only $3.  If you have more than two animals in the picture, it's a one-time additional fee of $1 for each animal after the first two.  We will offer holiday or regular pictures so that you can choose how the pictures will be printed (Santa pictures on an all-year calendar might not be your 'cup of tea', but will be perfect for holiday cards.)  The extra items are priced accordingly, and we will have our pricelist <br>available for you. <br> <br>On top of all of that cool stuff I've already mentioned, we can enhance your photos as you wait with colorful picture frames or text.  I'm going to be putting examples onto the HEART webpage (http://www.HeartMinistries.com) later today, and I invite you to click on the link I'll provide to see an example of our work."
