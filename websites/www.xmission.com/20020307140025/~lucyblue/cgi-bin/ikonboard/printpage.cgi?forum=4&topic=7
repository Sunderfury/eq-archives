        Reprinted from Email: <br> <br>"Hello all--  <br> <br>Did you know that mixed-breed dogs can compete in UKC events? &nbsp;They can! &nbsp; They just need to be registered with UKC.  <br> <br>Any registration or entry forms can be downloaded from the UKC website: &nbsp; <a href="http://www.ukcdogs.com" target="_blank">http://www.ukcdogs.com</a> . &nbsp;I believe there is also something about the rules for  <br>competition there, also.  <br> <br>Here's the information about our UKC Obedience Trials that are coming up:  <br> <br>Entry fees are $15 pre-registration; $20 day-of-show registration. &nbsp;Make checks payable to Donna Eliason. &nbsp;Trial will be held at Willow Creek Dog Training Center, indoors. &nbsp;Address is 2055 East Creek Road, Sandy.  <br> <br>Trial start time is 10:00 each day. &nbsp;Day-of-show registration is at 8:30.  <br> <br>We still need sponsors for our class placement awards, if you're interested. &nbsp; I believe it's $5 for each class for each day.  <br> <br>Mel Stanley will judge both days.  <br> <br>There will be lunch offered for a small fee, as well as goodies.  <br> <br>I will be judging at the GSLDTC Fun Match this weekend, and if you need forms or wish to bring me your entries, I will be glad to help you.  <br> <br>If you have any further questions, please let me know!  <br> <br>See you soon!  <br> <br>Deb Nendell and The Boys  <br>Sammy (C.G.C., U.D., ASCA-C.D., T.D.I.), Parker, John Henry  <br>and Pepper (C.G.C., T.D.I.), who will live in our hearts forever "
