        Our last vacation was to San Diego to visit family. &nbsp;Robin loved the beach and we ended up going every day! &nbsp;They have 'Dog Beach' in Ocean Beach, Fiesta Island in Mission Bay and a few others we didn't get to that are all off leash. &nbsp;Along the way we stopped at the Virgin River Casino for the night, it was the most dog friendly motel we've stayed at, and very cheap too. <br>We'd like to take more fun trips with our dog, any suggestions?

        That sounds like fun. I definitely want to take my dogs to the beach sometime... though encouraging them to like the water a bit more first would probably be a good idea. &nbsp;:) <br> <br>We are going to Coyotte Buttes in September, a place in Southern Utah which is supposed to be very beautiful. &nbsp;It's reservation only and you can make them 6 months in advance. I hope to take some pictures while there and post them up on the web. &nbsp;Do you have any beach pictures?

        I have a couple pictures of the beach (and some other adventures on our web site). &nbsp;Robin loves to travel anywhere, anytime. &nbsp; <br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Cottage/6787/robin.htm" target="_blank">http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/Cottage/6787/robin.htm</a> <br> <br>
