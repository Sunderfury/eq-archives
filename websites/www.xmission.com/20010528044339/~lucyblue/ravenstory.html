<p>
I was born in Qeynos, in the land of Norrath, on the server of Mithaniel Marr.  I was
born half elven, and half human, which is not too uncommon in my city.   I
chose the profession of Paladin, for I wanted to dedicate my life to good.  Destroying the
evil in the world, wiping out the scores of undead which ravish our world, and spread
the light of my god Rodcet Nife.
</p>

<p>
As all others of my line I was allowed to take a last name once reaching my twentieth season. 
I serve good, as all Paladins must, so some might critisize my choice of last name.  Isn't
the raven a carrion bird?  Does it not feed off the death of other beings? Is it not dark
of wing and beady of eye?  Yes, it is those things.  However, my reason is just, and
I will explain it here.
</p>

<p>
The name RavenHeart is one I chose after much deliberation, which I can only go into in some minor detail.
It is neither the name of my mother or of my father.  Though both of them are good, honest
people, I chose rather a name which would describe my plight in life.  My destiny, if you
will.
</p>

<p>
For many years I have studied to become the best Paladin I may.  I have many more years
before me, but this story is of my past.  I took the name RavenHeart after many years of
deliberation, realizing it might be a name frowned upon by others of my kind.  My story begins
in the plains of East Karana.  Some of you may be familiar with the lands, for they are
well traveled and scoured with creatures both vile and evil.  When I was much less
experienced I only traveled through the area, for I was not skilled enough to hold my
own against these creatures.  However, it was during one of these times I first had
a glimpse of what my last name would be.
</p>

<p>
There are undead reavers scattered throughout this land, as well as large, frightening
griffawns.  Neither of these was I able to attack with any amount of confidence.  However,
with my trusted friend Frax before me I was courageous enough to run across the plains.  
It was unfortunate when I lost sight of Frax and became lost.
</p>

<p>
Eastern Karana is not a place a tenth seasoned paladin is wont to be lost in.  I shivered
in my brand new boots as I gazed about myself, hoping Frax would indeed be quick to find
me.  But I had little hope.  She had told me our destination, a bridge, but which way
was it?  I turned around three times and became even more lost. It was terribly 
unfortunate, for my death seemed certain.
</p>

<p>
I heard the cackle of the undead, thought I sensed the wingbeats of the griffawn. I
hurried to a tree and climbed it, hoping I could spot Frax as a dot against the grass.
I could not.  So with some semblance of courage I raised my chin, straightened my
shoulders, and headed in the direction I thought was correct.  The sun, as it would be, was
straight overhead.  I could not tell east from west, north from south, or even up, it seemed,
from down.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly my foot slipped into a hole and my ankle twisted.  Indeed!  My heart skipped a
beat as pain shot up my leg and I fell to the ground.  I couldn't move. I was
frightened more than I'd like to admit, and now there were needles of pain coursing
through my leg.  I set my jaw and pulled my sword close to me, also protecting myself
with my shield.  Where was a cleric when you needed one?  I set my mind to
concentrating and pulled on my own healing abilities.  It took some time and
effort, but I was able to cast enough healing to mend my ankle.  The pain slowly
left, and I sat on the ground, sweat dripping down my forehead, and anger slowly
growing in my breast.
</p>

<p>
I stood and narrowed my eyes.  The sun was moving across the sky and finally I could
discern which way was west.  I started forward hunched with anger and bent from
my own stupidity.
</p>

<p>
It was then the undead reaver appeared.  Only one, thank the gods, but it was enough
to give me quite a fight. I raised my sheild, danced the words of yaulp upon my lips,
and prayed.  It came on quickly.  I had very little chance of survival, but I would
have to give it a try.  It was all I could do.
</p>

<p>
It was then the raven appeared. Never before have I seen a raven, and never again do I
think I might. It was larger than a natural raven, almost the size of a black griffawn.
It circled and I saw it from the corner of my eye, when nearly all my concentration was
on the reaver.  I slashed at it, clipping an arm, and then its chest.  But it was fast,
and stronger than I.  Regardless, I continued, and the raven circled.
</p>

<p>
The reaver hit me a terrible blow on my sheild arm, and I could barely raise it to
protect myself.  Another bash, and again I was weakened. I thought surely the raven
was there to feast on my corpse once I was dead.  The reaver was a terrible sight,
one eye missing, blood dripping from countless open sores. I wished it was he the raven
had smelt.  However, I was unable to tell, and fought on.
</p>

<p>
Their was a screech then, and I thought a passing griffawn had spotted me.  However, it was
the raven.  It launched itself into the eye of the reaver, and the beast fumbled.  I was
able to slash it across the arm, and the arm fell to the ground.  A bit of faith grew in
my heart as the reaver took two steps back. I pursued.  The raven danced in its sight
and I slashed again, able this time to skewer the beast through the chest.  My magic
blade sent bolts of lightening through the foul creature, and it shuddered where it stood.
I removed my blade and pierced the reaver again.  And again. And a final time.
</p>

<p>
It fell.  I nearly did as well.
</p>

<p>
The reaver died, as well as the undead can die.  I picked through the corpse blindly,
finding nothing of value.  Quickly I wiped my blade on the clean grass, took a fleeting
look at the raven who chewed heartily on the dead beast, and ran toward the bridge.
</p>

<p>
There have been other times, in the last eight seasons, that similar things have happened.
Those I have shared my story with have told me I have dreamt the ravens. That they have
not truly appeared for me.  However, I believe they were sent to me. Not each time I
am in turmoil will they come, but come they do.  And to me, the raven has a heart of
gold, taunting my enemies with courage and beauty.  The black wings are ever glossy and
their eyes seem to have some eery intelligence.
</p>

<p>
It is this reason I chose the name RavenHeart.  For I believe the heart of the raven is
true, and beats along side mine. And perhaps, somehow, watches over me.  So believe me
when I say the heart of the raven which guides me is as good as any paladin may hope
to become.
