        Atherton Park is a great off leash park in Taylorsville. &nbsp;It's completely enclosed and double gated. &nbsp;It is, however lacking in shade. Volunteers are trying hard to get trees. &nbsp;Last year there was a big push to move the park to a nicer area. &nbsp;Any one interested in putting thier 2 cents in, there is a meeting the third Tuesday of every month at the Taylorsville Fire Station 7pm.

        Robin, thanks for your information on Atherton Park. It is one of the parks I regularly go to with my dogs. Though there is little shade, it's a great, safe fenced in area.

        Been there several times with my best friend. &nbsp;You are right about the shade problem, but if you go in the evening when it is cool, there are a lot of good doggies and their people.

        The park is moving. We are looking at late next year time frame. The new location will be off of 5400 South by the jordan river, where the Arrow 103.5 station used to be. The new park will include a stream,trees, covered benches, and restrooms. This will be one of several parks in that area they will be building :cool: Everything that is done to they old park will be transfered to the new facility.:) Enjoy!!!!

        I am new to this website, and find the information very helpful.  I love taking my dog (Rocksey) for walks, and find that it is difficult to find good parks to do so.  The information of this Atherton Park is very helpful.  What is the exact location of this park?  I look forward to taking my dog there, and to the new park soon.  Thank you!

        Hi Tamia, <br>Atherton Park is located at 4500 South 815 West.  It is a great fenced in area.  It's especially nice when I don't want to walk around and just like to sit and watch the dogs play.  :) <br> <br>Thanks for visiting the site I'm glad it's helpful!  :) <br> <br>Cynthia
