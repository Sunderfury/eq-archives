My real name is Cynthia, and I was born in Chicago, Illinois.  My Mother was born in Germany, and my Father's
parents in Denmark. Thus it is not difficult for me to know what countries I originated in.
<br><br>
These two pictures are a few years old, perhaps I will be able to get new ones soon.  The left picture
is me all dressed up, which happens rarely.  The right picture is when I was camping in 1988 or so, boy
was I young back then.

I have one sister named Chris.  She has a son named Sabastion, and he looks just like my Dad.  Most of my 
Father's family is still located in Chicago and it is fun to go and visit.

<p>
I am interested in a variety of things. I love to travel, especially on camping trips and to the tropics.
I've been to Bonaire, Hawaii, Veracruz, Cancun, and Cozumel, and I hope to go on more trips soon, maybe
even Australia.  I love dogs.  I currently have two, Levi and Lucy (they are on the webcam on the front
page).  Not many Blue Smooth Collies are seen in Utah, and most people think they are a mix between a
Greyhound and an Australian Shepherd.  However, they are both pure-bred collies and Levi is a Champion
in the show ring.  I have fostered various homeless dogs also, though my busy work schedule and small house have
prevented me from doing so sometimes.  I also have a cat, Littles, who is very sweet and shy and, yes,
clumsy.  I also love to sail and scuba dive, snorkel, and see the world. I also enjoy playing the online
computer games Everquest and Dark Age of Camelot.  They are a great deal of fun and can sure be a time-sink.
I also like to sit in front of the fireplace with a good movie or a good book and relax the evening away.

<p>
I am a Programmer Analyst for the State of Utah.  I've been working for the State since August 1988... a very
long time.  Hopefully I'm almost half way to retirement.  I like my job and the people I work with are
great. My main work emphasis is CoBOL, with some dabbling in Powerbuilder, and web design. I graduated
from The Salt Lake Community College, oh... was it 1999? In CIS.  Before that I was a Family Support
Worker for the Division of Workforce Services.
</p>

<p>
I'm living in a little house in Salt Lake City, Utah. I love my house, it's a rambler and brink.  Perhaps
I'll post a picture of it here. I live with Lucy, Levi, Littles, and my boyfriend Aaron.  He is my 
best friend in the world and we have a great time together.  We both love camping and playing computer
games. You can see pictures of our camping trips on the Vacations & Hobbies page.

Contacting me is pretty simple. Though my phone may be busy when I'm playing on the computer, or unplugged
because the DSL works better that way, you can always <a href="mailto:lucyblue@utahdogs.com_removethisspamfilter">
email</a> me, or else most likely find me on one of the popular IM (instant messaging) web services. I have
accounts with AIM, ICQ, MSN, and I'm usually in IRC, too.
</p>

<p>
Well that's about it for me. If you'd like more information check out the other links on my frameset!
See you 'round.
