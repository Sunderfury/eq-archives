        I'm preparing to get a dog but would like to attend some dog shows to get acquainted with the breeds in real life -- tired of just READING about them! What's the best way to find out about dog shows in the area? I live in Orem but would travel around. Please respond to email as this forum doesn't seem busy enough to visit every day. Thanks! <br> <br>mal@byu.edu

        There is an email list set up for dog events in Utah. &nbsp;It's through Yahoo, and I think they have a calendar on there, too. (Though I wish more people would post information here, too) &nbsp;:) <br> <br>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UtahDogEvents/
