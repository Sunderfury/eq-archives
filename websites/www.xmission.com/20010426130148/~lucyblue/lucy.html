Hi, I'm Lucy.<br>
My full name is Elsinore Lucilla Aurelius, and I hope to
be a champion one day.
I am a smooth blue collie and I was born on February 15,
1999.  I flew to my new home in Utah from the Chicago
O'hare airport.  It was rather scary, and when my new Mom
picked me up I was shaking and didn't want to come out of my
safe crate.  But my new home was nice, I now live with
<a href="dogpics.html">Kip</a> and 
<a href="levi.html">Levi</a>.
Kip teaches me lots of stuff, like using the dog door and
going up and down the stairs in the back yard.  I like to
pick up all the fun things at home, but my Mom says I can't
carry them all around.  She wants me to play with only things
she calls 'toys,' but I can't figure out which are toys and
which are not.  I'm sure I will soon, but in the mean time
I'll just try everything.  Levi is my new little brother, he was born
in November 1999, and is lots smaller than me, but I like to wrestle with him!

     My Mom took me to puppy kindergarten, and it was fun. I
     got to play with lots of other dogs.  Then she gave me
     treats to make me do funny things, but it's not so bad as
     long as I get the treat!

     <font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS, Monotype Corsiva, Arial">
     Here are some pictures of me.  My Mom will probably take more and
     make them look better in the future.  But for now she likes to
     play with me in the yard and in the house, and take me and
     Kip for walks.  It's fun.  She says when I'm older she'll take
     me to agility and obedience classes.  Those sound like fun,
     too.

    I am growing up pretty fast, and Mom is surprised at how big I am.  These pictures were taken in September 1999, I am 7 months old.  I love to sleep on the couch!
