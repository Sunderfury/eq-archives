On 18 December 1999 a friend, myself, 
<a href="dogpics.html">Kip</a>, and 
<a href="lucy.html">Lucy</a> traveled to Pembroke Collies in Idaho to see their three
recent litters.  Judie and Eliza Dunkle are the breeders and take great
care of their new puppies.  This page has the pictures I took during this trip and
a little information on the dogs, bitches, and puppies.

These first three pictures are from the breeding of Ch Elsinores Hot
Pants, CGC and North Country Pembroke Aurora.  Pants is a smooth blue dog and
Zoe is a smooth white bitch with a tri-colored head.  
Judie Dunkle, Pants' owner, says "Pants was smooth winners dog at 
the 1995 CCA National and Nationally ranked for two years.  Zoe is pointed
but due to a foot injury she is no longer being shown. Zoe is the dam of 
two Champions from her 1st litter. She is line bred on Apple Valley Yankee 
Master ( a Ch. Apple Valley The Wagon Master Son ) and Ch Pride 'n Joy Leading Lady."

Sarah ( Pembroke Strawberry Wine ) is a smooth sable and white
bitch.  Judie says of this second litter:  "Sarah is pointed and has not finished her
Championship yet. Her parents are Pembroke Front Page News (ptd) X North
Country Pembroke Aurora (ptd).  She is a littermate of Ch. Pembroke Legend of
the Masters and Ch. Pembroke Mischievous Moment.
Both of these litters excell in nice clean smooth heads with very correct
parallel headplanes and wonderful nice full muzzles with plenty of
underjaw.  We are extremely pleased with the nice sound bodies that all are
displaying."

<p>
<font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS, Monotype Corsiva, Arial"> 
The litter was four weeks old when I
visited on December 18, 1999.  They are playful little balls of fur.
When I visited it was lunch time, and the puppies
ate a mixture of yogurt, puppy food, and some canned pumpkin.  They devoured the food
like they'd never eaten before.  But they were plump little guys!

Above is a picture of a the sable merle bitch among her littermates.  You can 
clearly see the tris and blues also in this litter.  
I thought her face was just darling.  She has no mask, which the other colors usually do. 
She justed wanted to look right into the camera for a picture.

well for him and we are excited to
have a litter of his kids here at Pembroke. Pas is a lovely extremely
balanced smooth blue who already has kids out there winning from her litter
with Ch. Apple Valley Pembroke Encore.  Pas is the daughter of Crystal

We made a little vacation of our trip to see the Pembroke puppies.  I had to add
a picture of Lucy on the bed, all sprawled out as usual.  Kip got the floor, because he
doesn't like the bed.  But they had a great time.  Lucy was in heat during the
trip, so we had to be careful that no boy dogs got too interested in her.

On the way back we all stayed at Lava Hot Springs at a great hotel called
The Riverside Hotel.  We got a room with a king size bed, and it was the first
time Lucy slept on the bed and didn't hog the whole thing!  This is me
brushing my hair.  Of course I forgot to bring a hair drier and I was cold for
a while until it dried.
