<font class="memname"><b>Ilsik Haucil By-Laws </b></font> <br>
<br>

<font class="title"><b>Divisions </b></font> <br>

<font class="small">There are Five Division in Ilsik Haucil.  Each Division has a Division
leader.<br></font>
<br>

<ol>
   <li><b>The Speaker (Guildmaster/Guildmistress)</b> <br>
   <font class="small">The Speaker's role is to see that the other four divisions work together and understand 
   each other.  Also, the rolse is required to confer between other houses and guilds.
   This is not a division persay as only the Speaker holds this, but the Speaker
   can assign others to speak on his/her behalf.
      <ul>
      <li>The Speakers term shall be (x) number of months.
      <li>The Speaker shall be determimed by a majority <a href="byvoting.html">vote</a>
      of the guild.
         <ul>
         <li>Candidates can be any officer in the council.
         <li>Once chosen as Speaker the officer retains his officer position, only his 
             duties increase.
         </ul>
      <li>Any matters the Speaker feels are necessary to bring before the guild shall be
          posted in the private forum, if a vote is requried a vote will be taken.
          <ul> 
          <li>All votes shall be majority ruiles unless otherwise stated. Votes other
              than majority votes can only be approved by the Officer's Council.
          <li>All voting shall last the duration of one week.
          </ul>
      <li>Any Full Member who believes a matter should be brought up for discussion shall
          inform the Speark who must post the member's concern of the issue in the private
          forum.  Alternately, the Member can post the topic and ask the Speaker to take
          a vote on the issue which.</font>
      </ul><br>
<li><b>The Home Guard</b><br>
   <font class="small">"The Home Guard is charged with the defense of the Speaker and
   the Division Leaders in Ilsik Haucil.  The Home Guard's task has never been easy,
   nor does it appear that it will ever become less arduous.  The men and women of the
   Home Guard are solid and proven in battle, willing to sacrifice their own lives for 
   the defense of others.  While other divisions may gather more glory, or be more
   romanticized in the stories, the true adventurer knows the value of thosewho serve
   for the defense of others.  Duty and Honor are high values, and hard to maintain,
   as they are directly related to keeping their charges hale and whole.  To this
   end, the members of the Home Guard have excelled, sometimes at the cost of their own
   lives."  -- <i>Valkith Winden Haucil, First Speaker of the House of Ilsik Haucil.</i>
   <ul>
   <li><font class="small">The Home Guard consists mostly of the clerics, druids, and 
       shaman of the Guild.
   <li>The Home Guard is lead by the Lord Commander.
      <ul>
      <li>Only the Lord Commander can actually command the Speaker when it comes to
          matters of the Speaker's safety.  The duties of the Lord Commander are thankless,
          and in battle he falls under the Lord Captain of the 6th.  However, even the
          Lord Captain would be advised to listen to the Commander's council in matters
          of defense and the safety of the Speaker.
      <li>The Lord Commander is a Division Leader and an Officer.
      </ul>
   <li>The Lieutenant Commander of the Home Guard is the second in command.
      <ul>
      <li>This is the right hand of the Lord Commander for the Home Guard 
          and the Lord Captain of the 6th.  His duties are similar, taking orders directly
          from the commanding officer of their division and filtering it down through the 
          ranks.  Should the Lord fall in battle or subterfuge, it is the Lieutenant's
          responsibility to assume his Lord's role. To this end the Lieutenant Commander
          is trusted, highly valued, and proven in battle and defense.  When the Lord
          is absent the Lieutenant speaks on his behalf.
      <li> This position is an Officer position.
      </ul>
   <li>The Sheild Bearers consist of all other members which are not Officers.  
       The Sheild Bearers are the backbone of the Home
       Guard, and as the name implies they are the ones who serve in the defense of 
       others.  Only the most honorable and dutiful members are asked to join the Home
       Guard.
   <li>The Banner's Man, or Color Guard as some other houses have called them, is a position of
       honor.  The person with this title has shown courage and bravery beyond the normally
       high standards of the 6th and the Home Guard.  Some would call this bravery. 
       Some, recklessness.  But sometimes that is enough to turn the tides of battle.  Where the
       Banner's Man goes so does the House.  The House colours carry the honor of the House,
       and it is a grave responsibility to ensure the safety of the colors. </font>
   </ul></font>
<br>
<li><b>The Sixth</b><br>
   <font class="small">"From the ashes on another world rises the 6th.  When Ilsik Haucil
   was lost in its convictions and astray from its rightous path, the 6th Division retained its
   core values, and was an example of the past glories and honor Ilsik Haucil once held." --
   <i>Valkith Winden Haucil, First Speaker of the House Ilsik Haucil</i> <br>
   History:  The 6th fell to the last man in a rear guard action that saved three other
   divisions as well as saving the Speaker from certain death.  For their past actions
   Valkith chose The 6th to be the example to Norrath of how a professional army should act.
   The 6th is the vanguard of Ilsik Haucil, and Ilsik Haucil is well known and thought of 
   throughout Norrath because of the actions of The 6th in the field.
   <ul>
   <li>The 6th is mostly composed of the Warriors, Rangers, Shadow Knights, and Paladins of 
       the Guild.
   <li>The 6th is lead by the Lord Captain.
      <ul>
      <li>The Lord Captain is the 6th's commanding officer.  The Lord Captain holds the
          second highest rank in House Ilsik Haucil, second only to the Speaker.  In manners
          of war and battle all others should defer to his judgement.  However, he should also
          take council from the others.  The Lord Captain is brave, well seasoned in combat,
          and fierce in loyalty.
      <li>The Lord Captain is a Division Leader and an Officer.
      </ul>
   <li>The 6th's second in command is the Lieutenant Captain.
       <ul>
       <li>This position is the right hand of the Lord Captain of the 6th.  His duties are
           similar to the Lieutenant Commander of the Home Guard.  He takes orders directly from
           the Lord Captain, and filters it down through the ranks.  Should the Lord Captain fall
           in battle or subterfuge, it is the Lieutenant's responsibility to assume his Lord's
           role.  To this end the Lieutenant Captain is trusted, highly valued, and proven in
           battle and defense.  When the Lord Captain is absent, the Lieutenant speaks on his
           behalf.
       <li>The Lieutenant Captain of the 6th is an Officer.
       </ul>
   <li>The Sergeant Major is the title for the non-commisioned officer of the Shock Troupers.
       A leader in his or her own right, the Sergeant Major is the best Shock Trouper, proven
       in battle, bravery, cunning, and the ability to survive and accomplish almost impossible
       goals.  The Sergeant Major leads the Shock Troupers into battle and should fit the role.
       The Sergeant Major also precides as the Sergeant at Arms in all officer council meetings.
   <li>War Dancer, made up of the Rangers of The 6th.  The War Dancers are warriors who are 
       familiar with close combat and ranged combat.  They are highly skilled trackers and deadly
       in combat.  Most prefer the woods to the cities.  However, this does not have to be the
       norm.  War Dancers serve as the advance scouts of The 6th when in the field, and are
       trained to hunt down and eliminate the leaders of the opposing army.
   <li>Shock Trouper, made up of the Shadow Knights and Warriors of The 6th.  The Shock
       Troupers of The 6th are the front line souldiers.  They are trained for and excel in
       close quarter combat, smashing through enemy lines, and causing damage and disruption
       of rank and file.  These warriors are bit, strong, and unwilling to yeild in battle.
       They posess bravery which borderlines on lunacy, and they are an awesome sight to
       behold in battle.
   </ul>
</font>
<br>
<li><b>The Grey Watchers</b> <br>
   <font class="small">"The Grey watchers, the unseen shadows, ther gatherers of information,
   the whispers of movement in the dark.  In a world where allies become enemies, and enemies
   can become allies, these dedicated few are the eyes and ears of Ilsik Haucil.  Call them
   rogues, call them thieves, call them assassins, just be wary of your surroundings when you
   do call their name, more than likely they already know of your conversation." -- <i>Valkith
   Winden Haucil, First Speaker of the House of Ilsik Haucil.</i><br>
   The Grey Watchers gather information.  They also report enemy movement and uncovered
   rumors.  The recruitment of the Greys is based on past performance and is usually
   up to the Keeper of the Watch upon approval from the Speaker.  The Grey Watchers have
   to be proven fighters as theyare more than often left to their own devices.  However,
   fighting should not be the only option open to the Greys.  Above all else getting
   information back to the House is the top priority.
   <ul>
   <li>The Grey Watchers is made up of the Bards, Rogues, and Monks of the Guild.
   <li>The Command of the Grey Watchers falls to the Keeper of the Watch.
      <ul>
      <li>This title is held by the leader of the Grey Watchers.  A guild or house leader in
          his or her own right, the word "Keeper" holds more weight than most in the matters
          of plans and operations of the House.
      <li>The Keeper of the Watch is a Division Leader and an Officer.
      </ul>
   <li>The second in command of the Grey Watchers falls upon the Impaler of the Watch.
      <ul>
      <li>The actual title is the Blade of the Watch.  However, this is simply because
          the blade is normally the favored weapon of the rogue.  The Impaler of the Watch
          is the right hand of the Keeper, and works in the shadows more deeply than the
          Keeper himself, who must remain more visible.  The Impaler has proven to be an
          individual who goes anywhere and will do anything, with the benefit of being able
          to whisper the deeds to the Keeper afterwards.  The title, while impressive,
          is not usually sought after when weighed against the constant risks required of it.
      <li>The Impaler of the Watch is an Officer.
      </ul>
   <li>Initiate of the Watch are the other members of the Grey Watchers.  While these
       are the foot soldiers of the Grey Watchers, do not assume these members are lowly in
       any way.  They have proven themselves to be quick thinkers and dangerous 
       opponents.  These are the field agents, with the strength of the House to back them
       up in times of trouble.  Should you see one, it is only because they wish you to see
       them, and Ilsik Haucil troops are not far away.
   </ul>
</font>
<br>
<li><b>The Council of Mages</b><br>
   <font class="small">The Council of Mages is the magical arm of Ilsik Haucil.  It supports
   all other divisions and works hand in hand with them to acheive their goals.  from the 
   Darker Arts to the mastery of combat magic, the Council is the only division where 
   leadership is voted upon.  Each sphere of magic has a Counsellor, each of whom is an
   Officer.  These Counsellors vote upon whom is to be the Head of the Council.  Advisors
   make up the body of the Council.
   <ul>
   <li>All Counsellors on the Council of Mages are Officers and members of the Officer's Council.
   <li>Counsellor of Charm; The Counsellor of Charm heads the study of Enchantments, and applies
       them as he or she best sees fit within the ranks of Ilsik Haucil.
   <li>Counsellor of War; The Councellor of War heads up the study of wizardy, and the best
       way to apply that in the field against a foe.  The Counsellor of War and his or her
       advisors work very closely with the 6th to assure victory on the field.
   <li>Counsellor of Death; The Counsellor or Death heads all spells and research in the 
       matters of Necromancy.  While some may view this as a vile field of study and
       abomination one must remember death is a part of life, and life is a part of death.
   <li>Counsellor of Elements; The Counsellor of Elements heads up the magicians of
       the House and uses this knowledge and power to aid the House.
   <li>Advisors of War, Charm, Elements, and Death; these are the rest of the members of
       the Council of Mages.  They assist their respective Counsellors with their knowledge
       to help the Council best decide how to destribute their resources to help the House
       Ilsik Haucil.
   </ul>
