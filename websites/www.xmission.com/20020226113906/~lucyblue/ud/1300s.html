      Herm Franks Park is located at 1300 South and between 700 East and 800 East. 
      During the winter months many
      people take their dogs after work to this park to play.  Please note, the
      park is not fully fenced and there is a great deal of traffic that
      travels past. </p>

      However, for the careful dog owner and the well behaved dog, the park is a great
      area for people and dogs to socialize and run around and play.  The park has a
      few baseball diamonds, and I have been told that when people are playing, they
      would prefer dogs going to some of the other parks. </p>

      Lucy and Kip had a great time when we visited.  However, I was nervous about
      the traffic and lack of fencing, for they could get distracted if I'm not
      careful. Levi was too little to do much dog socializing, so he waited for us
      in the truck. He wasn't too happy about it, though. </p>

      The park has a nice central location and many people have a good time
      visiting.  Enjoy! </p>
