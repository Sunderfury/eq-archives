              </font> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well, 
              here is what I have learned about Fletching and Bowyering as a Level 
              10 Ranger with a skill of 55 in the craft. </font></p>
            <ol>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                suggest you invest very few points in Fletching to get it started. 
                I would recommend between 4 and 8. I personally used 5 pts at 
                level 5 as a ranger to get going. The skill improves rather rapidly.<br>
                <br>
                </font>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Be 
                warned that fletching is NOT fun. It is very tedious. You have 
                to put 1 of each of the 4 arrow components in to the kit 1 at 
                a time. If you put in a stack you will get back 1 arrow if successful. 
                So, before you start get comfortable and be ready to excercize 
                your wrist often.<br>
                <br>
                </font>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Begin 
                by buying up 20 of each component, and get started. Buy the cheapest 
                of each of the 4 components, so each attempt costs you 4 copper. 
                You will use these arrows to archer with as they are the basic 
                arrow, providing a range of 50 and damage of 1. You usually rise 
                2-4 pts per grouping of 20 attempts. So depending how many training 
                points you invest, you will reach the cap of triviality on the 
                basic Wood Arrow in 3 or 4 batches of 20 arrows. Not too bad.<br>
                <br>
                </font>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                next type of arrow is the Class 1 Wood Arrow. This requires the 
                3 cp notch, which brings your cost per attempt to 6 cp. You will 
                fail a lot at this point in making arrows. Failures can increase 
                your skill, however, and the rate of increase is comparable to 
                the previous arrows. I would use these arrows as well to archer 
                with, as they provide a range of 75 and damage of 1. The cap of 
                triviality for these is a rating of 36. Making a rough guess at 
                this point you have probably spent 1 to 1.3 platinum on increasing 
                your skill to 35. You also have a nice number of arrows in your 
                inventory. I would now go and get a bow....<br>
                <br>
                </font>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DO 
                NOT BUY A BOW! The best part of being a fletcher is that you get 
                to make bows. The store bought bows are very expensive and not 
                good. With a skill of 35 you can easily make a bow that is better 
                than the store bought ones. I would recommend buying the bowyering 
                book, a Hickory staff, and some Linen string. This is rather cheap, 
                and your success rate should be very high at 35 skill. This lets 
                you make a Rough Hickory Recurve Bow with stats of Damage: 9 Delay: 
                46 and Range:50.<br>
                <br>
                </font>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
                go out and increase your archery skill. The best way by far to 
                do this is beat on animals that tend to run from you. When they 
                run do not chase. Instead you pull out the bow and you get easy 
                target practice. All the players I've seen w/ high Archery skill 
                do this. The second way to get in free shots is to group w/ a 
                warrior or other melee type and fire at the monster's back while 
                they are engaged.<br>
                <br>
                </font>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once 
                you cap out at a skill of 36 I'd make basic arrows to practice 
                archery with. Otherwise your expense may increase. At some point 
                however you wanna go above 36 to make better bows. Making Class 
                2 Wood Arrows will do this. They are composed of the better notch, 
                and the better fletch. The cost per attempt is now 1 sp 1 cp. 
                At this point things move up much more slowly. I only went up 
                1-2 pts per batch of 20 attempted. The skill cap for this type 
                of arrow is a fletching skill of 46<br>
                <br>
                </font>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
                go beyond 46 I suggest moving to the basic Bone Arrow, which includes 
                a Bone Shaft and all the other basic 1 cp components. The cost 
                per attempt now is almost 2 sp. I haven't reached the skill cap 
                for this item yet. I sell back the made arrows, because in my 
                opinion they are way to expensive to use. I take a loss on the 
                sale, but I think it's the right move.<br>
                <br>
                </font>
              <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
                this point you can make an Elm Bow, which provides an important 
                range bonus. Using a linen string and elm staff you can make a 
                Rough Elm Recurve Bow, with stats of Damage: 12 Delay: 47 and 
                Range: 75. Getting better. I now use Class 1 arrows as my basic 
                archery arrows as they both have ranges of 75 and I can now hit 
                for 13 pts per shot. The cost of the components for this bow are 
                around 2.5 Platinum.</font>
