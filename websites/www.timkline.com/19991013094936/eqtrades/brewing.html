            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
              you're reading this tome, you must want to be a brewer . . . and 
              a fine trade it is although not that profitable, but in my opinion 
              the most enjoyable skill in Norrath. Let us get started now. The 
              first step to becoming a brewer is creating a character; I highly 
              recommend a race/class that starts in Freeport as it is with out 
              a doubt the easiest place to start brewing and good beginner's city. 
              I would start off by investing about 15 practice points into the 
              skill (3 levels worth). After this you must get the book "Brewer's 
              Limericks", for easy reference I have included a transcript of the 
              limericks themselves from the book and have placed them below. The 
              limericks contain a few good recipes if you can pick them out :)</font></p>

              Ssra goes to move barley<br>

            <p><i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">My 
              good friend where is my cask?<br>

              With the rest of my crops<br>
              Or your death will be my next task!</font></i></p>

              Get them near her harbor<br>
              And you'll hear uproar if they dock</font></i></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
              start raising your skill I recommend Short Beer, the ingredients 
              are as follows: barley, hops, malt, and a cask. If you started in 
              Freeport you can get these ingredients from a few different sources 
              one such NPC is Kristin Charcoal a merchant in West Freeport, you 
              can get a cask from most taverns for about 3sp them being the most 
              expensive item most of the time. Now to begin brewing, first find 
              a still to mix your ingredients in, they look something like a barrel 
              with a hose connecting to a white bucket.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
              use the still, step up to it and left click on it and a window will 
              pop up with a "Combine" button at the bottom of the window. Put 
              your ingredients in the slots and hit the "Combine" button, if you 
              succeeded you will receive a message something like "You have combined 
              the ingredients to create something new!" and you will receive a 
              bottle of Short Beer. You should keep doing this until it becomes 
              trivial and then move on to a harder brew such as Ale, the ingredients 
              are barley, malt, water, and a cask this should get you to around 
              level 35. Then you can move on to Ol'Tujim's Fierce Brew, a HARD 
              brew, ingredients are barley, hops, yeast, malt, and a cask this 
              should raise you up to around 60%. No skill is really worth selling 
              to NPC's and it can be rather hard to sell ale to players. The known 
              effects of alcohol are increased strength and stamina, penalties 
              can include blurred vision, trouble walking, and maybe lowered intelligence. 
              These penalties can be reduced by a high alcohol tolerance skill 
              level. Now you ask, "What is the future of brewing?" and I have 
              a answer . . . sort of, if you go to Freeport and find Gregor's 
              tavern he will send you on the "Brewer's Compendium" quest, maybe 
              one of the hardest quests in the game. You must find and return 
              four rare items to Gregor which are as follows, Honey Jum from Rivervale, 
              a Kiola nut from the island of Eollisi, Erud's Tonic from a merchant 
              in Qeynos, and a Koalindl Fish from the Temple of Life in Qeynos. 
              Since I know of no one who has completed this quest and I haven't 
              myself, I don't know what you really get. The hardest item to find 
              is probably the Honey Jum and I suspect you must make it yourself. 
              These attempts below have all failed to produce Honey Jum.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jum 
              Jum Juice, Honeycomb<br>
              Jum Jum Juice, Honeycomb, Bottle<br>
              Jum Jum Juice, Honeycomb, Cask<br>
              Jum Jum Juice, Honeycomb, Water, Bottle</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              only other clue I have is there is a quest in Neriak rogue's guild 
              to assassinate Lil' Honeybugger because she makes the healing Honey 
              Jum for the halflings, so she would appear to be the one to talk 
              to about Honey Jum. Also you might need to bring honeycombs back 
              to get the Honey Jum. If you go to misty thicket there is another 
              Honeybugger there with a hurt hand. Give him a bandage and he'll 
              tell you how to get honeycombs from the bixies. If someone does 
              complete this quest, you can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:julian@patmos-international.com">julian@patmos-international.com</a>. 
              I hope this guide helps or maybe even inspires new brewers in Norrath!</font></p>
