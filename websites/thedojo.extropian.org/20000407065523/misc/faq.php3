<strong>1.0 Questions and Answers</strong>
<p>
<a name="1.1">1.1 Question: Where should I put my bonus points: STR, STA, AGI, DEX, INT, WIS, CHA?</a> 
<p>
<ul>Answer: There is no "right" answer to this question. A monk starts with 20 bonus points to distribute across six
 statistics, and useful monks have been created with those 20 points distributed to any of those statistics. 
No choice of distribution of the 20 points can be so wrong as to cripple the monk character. This is especially true 
since there exists particular equipment in the game to boost any statistic the monk might desire.
<p>
However this is not to say that all statistics are equal. As the monk is a melee class character, the most useful place 
to distribute the bonus points would be in those statistics that affect combat most directly: STR, STA, AGI, DEX. Even 
among these statistics, Stamina probably has the least benefit for a monk, as an increase in Stamina will not raise the 
monk's total hit points by much, and monks rarely run out of Stamina.
<p>
Once you get down to distributing points between STR, AGI and DEX, the choices become less clear-cut. Essentially STR and 
DEX enable a monk to do more damage in combat, while AGI helps a monk take less damage. The relative value of these three 
statistics is strongly debated even now on the various Monk boards and mailing lists.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.2">1.2 Question: In which city/what religion should I create my monk: Freeport or Qeynos?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: Just like the question of distribution of bonus points, this question has no "right" answer. Monks who are 
Agnostic start at the Qeynos monk guild. Monks who follow Quellious start at the Freeport guild. Monks of each city have 
their advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of Freeport are that: it has better newbie and mid-level zones easily 
accessible from the city, and Freeport monks have sufficient faction with the Qeynos monk guild to get the monk quests 
form the Qeynos monk guildmasters. The advantage of the Qeynos monks is that Qeynos monks are Agnostic and so don't get 
many faction penalties from religion. One disadvantage of Qeynos monks is that they don't start with sufficient faction 
to get monk quests from the Freeport monk guildmasters right away (see "Help! I'm a Qeynos monk, and the Freeport monk 
GMs won't hand out quests to me!")</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.3">1.3 Question: What is this weight limit thing I keep hearing about?</a> 
<p>
<ul>Answer: Monks have a weight limit of 14 pounds. If this weight limit is exceeded, the Armor Class (AC) of the monk 
is lowered. The extent of this drop in AC depends on the level of the monk and the amount by which the 14 pound limit 
is exceeded. As the monk advances in levels, this AC penalty becomes greater and greater. Above level 20 a monk can 
lose over 100AC just by being 10 pounds over the limit.
<p>
This weight limit is not so much of a problem for monks as you would first guess. Monks equipment is some of the lightest 
in the game (see "what armor should I wear?") and, as a class, monks are one of the classes least dependent on equipment. 
Some monks think of this weight limit as liberating rather than restricting.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.4">1.4 Question: Help! I'm a Qeynos monk, and the Freeport monk GMs won't hand out quests to me!</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: Agnostic monks of Qeynos do not get sufficient faction from handing in their guild note to receive quests 
from the Freeport monk guildmasters. Qeynos monks should try to raise their Ashen Order (Freeport monk) faction before 
they venture from Qeynos to Freeport. There are various monk quests in Qeynos (such as the Tomer Instogle quest) which 
can be completed to raise Ashen Order faction. Completing the yellow or white quests at the Qeynos monk guild will also 
raise Ashen order faction. These quests can be completed multiple times to raise faction.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.5">1.5 Question: Ack! I threw away my newbie tunic by mistake. How can I get that cool monk GM look back?</a> 
<p>
<ul>Answer: There are now several ways to get the monk guildmaster tunic look back.
<p>
<ul>1. Buy a cured silk tunic. (See "what armor should I wear?")
<p>
2. Buy a monk newbie tunic from a vendor. [Did anyone confirm whether this worked?]
<p>
3. Kill Tomer Instogle outside Qeynos and get his tunic. This is the worst option of the three as it can hurt your 
faction with the Qeynos monk guild.</ul></ul>
<p>
<a name="1.6">1.6 Question: Why shouldn't I use a weapon? I hit much harder with one right now at lvl 4.</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: Monks do get 1h Blunt and 2h Blunt weapon skills. Combined with the good Dual Wield and Double Attack of a 
monk, a monk could do more damage with good blunt weapons at low levels than with his or her fists. While it might make 
good sense to practice 1h Blunt occasionally to keep the skill up, it would be inadvisable to stick strictly with weapons. 
At the highest levels, monks will do more damage with his or her fists than with any blunt weapon. If a monk used only 
blunt weapons, his or her Hand to hand attack skill would lag behind. In addition blunt weapons are all quite heavy. 
Two blunt weapons alone could easily weigh 10 pounds and usually a lot more. Combined with armor and general inventory, 
this would put a monk well over the 14 pound weight restriction and reduce the monk's AC by 100 or more at levels 
above 20.</ul> 
<p>
<a name="1.7">1.7 Question: What armor should I wear?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: A simple answer would be "the lightest possible armor with the best AC and stat bonuses". The answer here 
will depend on your level. Below 10 you should aim to buy cloth, leather and raw/cured silk if you can afford it. 
Gradually switch into all mesh or cured silk as you gain in levels and have some available plat- trying to stay below 
the 14 pound weight limit.
<p>
One of the first items you should try to acquire once you have equipped yourself with cloth and leather armor are magic 
gloves. The cheapest of these are netted, woven or mesh gloves. You will need these to hit magic-only monsters. 
(See "How can I hit magic-only monsters like ghouls or wisps?")</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.8">1.8 Question: How can I hit magic-only monsters like ghouls or wisps?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: If you are below level 30, you will need magic gloves to hit these monsters. You will need netted, woven or 
mesh gloves to hit these creatures. [Your special attacks are all magical, except kick, and so don't need magic equipment 
to work on these monsters.] These gloves are (generally) only available from Froglocks in the Innothule Swamp and Guk 
(all types) or from the Qeynos sewers (netted only). You can usually buy these off other players for a few platinum.
<p>
Snakeskin Gloves, which come from Paw and are cheap, give a 3 DEX stat bonus but are not magic. Under level 30 monks 
should obtain a set of magic gloves and a set of Snakeskin Gloves. You can switch back and forth between gloves as you 
need.</ul> 
<p>
<a name="1.9">1.9 Question: What are pumice stones? What use are they? Where can I buy them?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: Pumice stones are limited use magic items with 5 charges of Nullify Magic. They sit in your inventory. To 
use them you right-click on the pumice stone with a player or monster targetted. This will cancel the first two buffs 
on that player or mob. Pumice stones can be used on yourself to nullify harmful DoTs or other spells on you. They can 
be cast on other players or monsters to cancel spells on them- very useful in PvP. Pumice stones can be bought on a 
vendor in the herbal shops in towns for between 15-18 plat, depending on charisma.</ul> 
<p>
<a name="1.10">1.10 Question: What is this damage absorption? Does mesh absorb damage better than cured silk? Should I wear a Mesh 
Tunic rather than a Lockjaw Vest to increase my damage absorption?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: Verant designers were questioned at a recent convention, and they stated that damage absorption is a myth. 
Wear the armor that will grant you the best AC.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.11">1.11 Question: Is there a bonus to experience gained for being in a group?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: The producer of Verant was quoted in a recent interview as saying that there was only a 10% bonus for being 
in a group. This bonus applied no matter the size of the group from 2-6.
<p>
There is no extra bonus for being in a 6 person group as opposed to a 5 person group.</ul>
<p>
<ul><i>[Sensei's note:]  As one of the fans of the site pointed out, on 11/15/1999 GZ's 'Archmage Answers' contradicted this:
<p>
<ul>Q: Is it true that I get more experience when I party?<br>
A: Yes. If you kill a monster solo, you get X experience. If a party of two kills a monster, you get X + P (P = Party Experience Addition), 
divided by two (half of that experience for each of you). The bigger your party, the bigger that P is - the Party Experience Addition is larger for three people then for then for two, and larger for four people then for three, etc. As a side note, pets do NOT count towards P (2 players and 2 pets still count as a party of 2).</i>
</ul></ul><p> 
<a name="1.12">1.12 Question: Why don't I seem to get double hits? Why don't I ever dodge/block?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: When you first gain a fighting skill, you need to train once in that skill in order to learn the "basics". 
[Note that this first train will give you as many gains in that skill as you have levels. So when you train kick at the 
guild at level 1, you start at a skill level of 1. When you train Round Kick at the guild at level 5, you will start with 
a skill level of 5.] Also four double attack, check that you aren't holding something like a lantern in your left hand.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.13">1.13 Question: I currently have Round Kick as my special attack. When I get Tiger Claw at level 10, will I be able to use 
both abilities at the same time?</a> 
<p>
<ul>Answer: Unfortunately, no. When you use a special attack ability, all of your other special attack abilities will be 
unavailable until your attack recycles.</ul> 
<p>
<a name="1.14">1.14 Question: When I get a new special attack, should I keep my old special attack skill keyed in?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: Yes! Usually when you get a new special attack, you will have maxed the skill on your old special attack. 
Since your skill in your new special attack will be low, and much lower than your skill in your old special attack, 
you will fight worse than you did with your old attack, at least for a while. However after you get your skill raised 
in your new attack, the new attack will be MUCH better. So use that new attack all the time, but keep your old attack 
available for close combats. For those close combats, switch to your old attack until your new attack improves. Once 
your new attack skill gets high enough, just delete your old attack.
<p>
There is another situation in which you will want to keep your old attack. Dragon Punch, which you get at level 25, 
recycles very quickly compared to Flying Kick, which you get at level 30. Flying Kick of course does a lot more damage. 
Against monsters that can cast, you will want a special attack which you can time to try to disrupt the monster's casting. 
Dragon Punch can be better in some cases for interrupting as it is available for re-use more quickly.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.15">1.15 Question: Will Round Kick/other special attack ever recycle faster?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: No. You'll get Tiger Claw at level 10 which recycles twice as fast. Special attacks have a fixed recycle 
time for each attack. The damage caused by the special attack will, however, increase as your skill in that attack 
improves.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.16">1.16 Question: How long does Mend take to recycle? Since I hear Feign Death is supposed to be one of our best abilities, 
does it have a long recycle time too?</a> 
<p>
<ul>Answer: Mend takes 6 minutes to recycle. You can even set a stop-watch for it. Feign Death recycles every 10 
seconds.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.17">1.17 Question: What should I spend my practice points on?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: There are generally two schools of thought on this issue. It is up to you to decide which of these works 
for you.
<p>
One school says that skills (and especially combat skills) raise quickly enough with use. Since they raise so fast, 
you shouldn't bother spending any practices in these skills beyond learning the basics. Since you save up so many 
practice points, you can use these training on trade skills and quickly advancing the skills which are very slow to 
raise initially. These skills would be Feign Death, Instill Doubt, Disarm and Flying Kick. Feign Death and Flying Kick 
are by far the most important of these.
<p>
The second school says that you should use your practice points to help you on your way, as saved practice points don't 
get you anywhere. Dumping a few points in Mend and Bind Wounds can make life easier at the lowest levels.</ul> 
<p>
<a name="1.18">1.18 Question: What is the best/quickest way to train Mend?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: Practice, practice, practice. Hit that Mend button every time you see it come up for the first few levels. You 
should be fighting constantly for these levels anyway, so the hit point gain will only help. Note that you don't need 
to actually heal any hit points to get a skill gain, so hit Mend whenever it becomes available while waiting on 
friends, travelling, waiting on a boat, etc.
<p>
Later on, and after you max your Mend skill for that level, you will want to hold off on that Mend until the 
right moment.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.19">1.19 Question: What is the best/quickest way to train Safe Fall?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: To train Safe Fall you need to fall down or off a height. Be careful when training this skill at very low 
levels, as you can incur a relatively large amount of damage for a small drop. You can train Safe Fall by finding 
a height next to a set of stairs for fast gains, such as the wall in Misty Thicket. Just run up the stairs and 
jump off. The best way to train Safe Fall is on the steep slopes of mountains. You generally find these steep slopes 
at the edges of zones, such as near the zone to Nektulos Forest in East Commons. Back up the slope and then run 
straight down it. When you hit the bottom, just back up again. Hit the Inventory button so you can watch yourself. 
As long as you see the tumbling animation for yourself, you will be getting practices in Safe Fall. While training 
Safe Fall it does not matter how far you fall, only that you fall.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.20">1.20 Question: What's this Bind Wounds skill for? What's the best way to train it up?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: Bind Wounds is one of the best and most underused of monk skills. As long as you are below 50% health, 
a successful Bind Wounds will heal you 1 hit point for every 4 levels you have in Bind Wounds skill. It can be expensive 
at the beginning, as each attempt takes a bandage and bandages cost at least 5 silver. However the ability to heal 
is invaluable, especially when soloing.
<p>
The best use of Bind Wounds when soloing, is to bind your wounds up to 50% and then use your Mend. You can get back 
to 75-80% of your health with almost no delay using this. This is one of the reasons monks are far better at soloing 
than warriors.
<p>
To train up Bind Wounds, use it whenever you are injured. Some monks like to combine Safe Fall practice with Bind Wounds 
practice by jumping off heights to drop below 50% health, then binding back up to 50% again. Other monks combine Swimming 
practice with Bind Wounds. After you run out of Stamina while swimming, you will start to drown and lose a certain amount 
of Hit Points per second. Allow yourself to drown below 50% health, then move to the shore and heal yourself up. Be 
careful if you do this below level 10, as it is quite easy to kill yourself if you are not paying attention.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.21">1.21 Question: It's so dark at night. What can I use for light?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: When you first start out, the cheapest light source available to you will be Fire Beetle Eyes. You can 
get these by killing and looting a Fire Beetle (almost every newbie area has these). Just put the Fire Beetle Eye in 
your inventory- not in your hands! It will light up a small area around you. When you gain some levels, you can buy 
a Lightstone or Greater Lightstone for even better light. After level 8 and after you have gained some magic gloves, 
you can even kill Will-o-Wisps for these stones.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.22">1.22 Question: Where do I find the monk guilds?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: The Qeynos guild is in North Qeynos, near the North Gate. The Freeport guild is in West Freeport, near the 
Theatre of the Tranquil. They are both marked on the maps that come with the game.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.23">1.23 Question: What does Sneak do? What's the use of Sneak?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: Sneak does not turn you invisible, however what it does do is greatly lower the radius in which monsters 
will attack you. You can test this by sneaking up behind a monster that would normally attack you, like an orc. You 
will see you can get much closer to the monster before it notices you than you can if you are not sneaking.
<p>
Sneak can be very useful getting out of nasty situations. Imagine that you turned the wrong corner and walked smack into 
a nasty critter that kills you right away. How do you get back to get your corpse away without getting killed again? 
Sneak in, use /corpse to move your corpse away and, with a bit of luck, you're home free. You can also sneak to get 
past guards and other aggressive monsters if you are very careful.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.24">1.24 Question: What types of character graphics will I be able to have and what items give them?</a> 
<p>
<ul>Answer: Monks are among the most limited of classes in the appearance of their character. There are 9 full sets 
of armor that a monk can wear: Cloth, Patchwork, Leather, Netted, Woven, Mesh, Raw Silk, Cured Silk, and the Plane of 
Fear Shiverback Armor. However Cloth and Netted have no character graphics; Woven and Patchwork look the same; and 
Leather and Mesh look the same. Raw Silk and Cured Silk are two new player made armor types, and Cured Silk is Monk-only. 
Cured Silk and the Shiverback armor look the same. If you want to get the same look as the monk guildmasters (and 
you are not level 46 yet) then get some Cured Silk items.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.25">1.25 Question: Where does Cured Silk come from? How do I make it?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: Cured Silk is a monk-only player-made armor. It gives the same protection as Mesh armor and is lighter. 
Short of armor and jewelry with magical boosts, this is the best non-magical armor you can buy. Or at least that you 
can buy without spending 1000's of plat.
<p>
Cured Silk is made using a combination of tailoring and brewing skills. The silk is first made by combining two Spider 
Silks, then you combine the silks with Heady Kiolas made with the brewing skill to make the Cured Silk.</ul>
<p>
<a name="1.26">1.26 Question: What's a good place to hunt?</a>
<p>
<ul>Answer: The answer here is going to depend on your level and how long you have played EQ. The most general advice 
would be to get to level 5 in the newbie zones outside your starting city. Once you have reached level 5, travel to 
Rivervale (have someone show you the way the first time). Get bound in Rivervale and hunt in Misty Thicket. This is one 
of the best newbie areas in the game. You can easily reach level 11-12 here before you need to hunt elsewhere.</ul>
