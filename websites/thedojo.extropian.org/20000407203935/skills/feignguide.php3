<center><strong>The Art of the Feign Death Pull</strong>
<br>
<i>By Synjyn DragonFist (Lords of Valor), Erollisi Marr</i></center>
<p>

Feign Death, a skill Monks learn at 17th level is quite arguably one of the best, if not the best, skills in the game.  With this skill monks can learn a technique called the "Feign Pull." This technique allows the monk to split creature spawns up and bring them back one at a time to their group to fight.  This allows for more efficient battles and easier pulling later after the spawn spot has been "spaced" properly.
<p>
I will be explaining the details of this technique as best I can so that my Brother & Sister monks may learn from my knowledge.  It should also be noted that the necromancer and shadow knight also get Feign Death, but as a spell and not a skill.  The same technique can be used by either of them, but I would advise against it as spells have casting time, can fizzle, can be interrupted and can also fail just as our skill can. 
<p>
I would also like to say that the Feign Pull is also an art form.  Not everyone can do it and not everyone can do it well.  It takes skill, timing, judgement, strategy and patience.  As with all things, it also takes lots of practice.  While the principle of the technique will be the same everywhere you use it, there will be little things you will have to learn in each zone.  Not every creature reacts the same, all areas will not offers the same tactical advantages and creature pathing will not always be the same.
<p>
That being said I would now like to define some terms that I, myself, or the monk community at large uses when speaking of the Feign Pull.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>"Agro"</strong></dt>
<dd>When a creature becomes angry with you and attacks</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>"Agro Range"</strong></dt>
<dd>The range in which a creature will detect you and go agro.  This range differs from creature to creature and also gets 
smaller as your levels go up</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>"Chain Pull"</strong></dt>
<dd>When two or more characters work on a pull.  A monk is primary puller and anyone can be secondary puller, but another  
monk is preferable</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>"Feign / Feigned"</strong></dt>
<dd>When you use your Feign Death skill you will be laying on the ground and, if successful, creatures will think you are dead.</dd>  
<p>
<dt><strong>"Feign Pull"</strong></dt>
<dd>The technique used to break up a creature spawn and bringback manageable numbers of creatures for a group to fight</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>"Home Point"</strong></dt>
<dd>The spot where a Static spawns</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>"Mem Wipe"</strong></dt>
<dd>When you are removed from a creatures hate list</dd>
<p>                                     
<dt><strong>"Pop-N-Drop / PnD"</strong></dt>
<dd>When you stand up and re-Feign several times to increase the chance of a Mem Wipe on a creature</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>"Pull / Pull'n"</strong></dt>
<dd>The act of going out to find and bring a creature(s) back to your group to fight</dd> 
<p>
<dt><strong>"Sort / Sort'n"</strong></dt>
<dd>What you do when you are Feigned and waiting for creatures to leave the area you're Feigned in so that you can bring
the last one standing near you back to your group</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>"Static / Stationary"</strong></dt>
<dd>A creature that always stays in the spot it spawned in</dd>
<p>
<dt><strong>"Wanderer / Roamer"</strong></dt>
<dd>A creature that has no set spawn point and moves around a certain pattern or path</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Now to explain how the technique is actually used; again, this is based solely on my experiences and what has worked for me.
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>If you do not know the area you are hunting you need to go do some scouting and learn the lay of the land.  Learn what kind of creatures live there, where they spawn, how often they spawn and where the wanderers are.  Learn all the twists, turns and land marks of the area.  Lots of this will just come with time and exploration.</li>
<p><li>Find a good spot for your group to hunt.  This should be an area with few to no wanders.  Also the closer to the zone border you can be the safer it is in case of an emergency.  Many good hunting areas will be far away form any zone so a monk's skill with Feign Pull will mean the success or failure of a night's adventure.</li>
<p><li>Find a good spot far enough away from your group and the creatures you are pulling to Feign.  You don't want creatures close enough to your group that they agro on them and you don't want to be close enough to the creatures area you just pulled so they reagro on you.</li> 
<p><li>Find the creatures you want to pull.  You can use a thrown weapon to attract their attention, you can run up and attack them hand to hand or you can Agro Range pull them.  Each method of pulling has it's on advantage and disadvantage.  It's up to the individual to figure out what works best for them and what method works best in which areas.</li>
<p><li>After you have some creatures angry with you run back to your Feign spot, turn around where you can see them and Feign Death.  If you are successful the creatures will just stop attacking you and just stand there for a little bit.  The creatures will then start to leave and go back to where they came from.  They will usually do this one at a time, but occasionally they will all leave at the same time.  If they all leave at once you will have to make judgement calls and use every split second of distance between the creatures to further work to space them more so with standing and re-Feigning.  Sometimes you just have to bring more than one, but if you are patient you can almost always bring a single.</li>
<p><li>Once all creatures but one have left you stand up, attack the creature and head back to your group.  A hot key set up for a group say  "Incoming" is very useful.  It allows your party to be ready for your return and can also be used to let your group know how many creatures you bringing back if you have more than one.  Example: "Incoming, Incoming, Incoming" when you are bringing three creatures back.</li>
<p><li>Help your group to kill the creature(s) you just pulled then check with all casters so you know how much mana everyone has.  You should always check with your casters after every fight.  If you run off and bring more creatures and your only healer is only at 20% mana then you could be in trouble.  Don't rely on the casters to take initiative and give you mana updates.  You control the flow of the pulls so you should always know how combat-ready your party is.</li>
<p><li>Now its time to pull again.  Depending on how quickly you can sort your pulls and how quickly your pull dies you may need to wait a few min between battles to pull again.  This is to allow you to "space" the spawn time.  If you are pulling a large area and several different creature camps you will want to do this for ease of pulling later.  There is no need to have to Feign Pull every single time if you can set the spawn time to allow you to pull a single as soon as a creature spawns.</li>
</ol>
<p>
That is the basics of the Feign Pull and should work well just as described on all creatures below 35th level.  Creatures 35th and above behave differently to Feign Death so more patience and techniques have to be brought into play to be successful. 
<p>
<strong>Shorter Distance  -</strong>  In step 3 any distance far enough away from the creatures area you pulled from is good, but not so at higher levels (at least for better success rates that is).  You will want to shorten the distance you pull the creatures away from their spawn spots, but you still need to pull them far enough away so that when you have your single creature left that it does not re-agro his friends when you pull him.  The reason for the shorter distance is two-fold:  it allows you to see, sometimes hear, when a creature is back to its Home Point, which in turn increases your chance of a Mem Wipe on these same creatures.
<p>
<strong>Pop-N-Drop  -</strong>  This is a very useful technique and also usually involves a bit  more pain.  It is used on Wanderers and for Statics that you have pulled long distances.  Each time you Pop-N-Drop successfully it increases the chance of a Mem Wipe on the creatures you pulled.  This is also useful to Mem Wipe creatures when you are just passing though an area and don't want or need to fight, but have creatures go agro on you.  The extra pain of this technique come into play when you are trying to keep one creature with you to pull back to your group, but still have to Mem Wipe all his friends.  You have to stand up long enough to find out if the others are coming back or not.  In turn you will be attacked by the one still with you.  Once you are sure you have Mem Wiped the others, call the "Incoming" and  head back to your group.
<p>
<strong>Chain Pull  -</strong>  A Chain Pull can be used on any and all pulls, but is only necessary in certain situations or places.  The main time a Chain Pull is used is on the Planes or on difficult creatures such as Imps and Giants in Sol B.  This allows much harder creatures to be pulled single and with as little injury as possible to the pullers.  A pair of monks is always best to do a Chain Pull, but anyone can be a secondary puller.  Also more than two people can be used to Chain Pull to increase the pulling distance, but I will only explain the technique used for two Monks.
<p>
<ul><ol>
<li>The secondary puller Feigns in a spot where the primary puller will pull to and Feign.</li>
<p><li>The primary puller goes out, pulls some creatures to where the secondary puller is Feigned and then Feigns themselves.</li>
<p><li>Just as with the basics of the Feign Pull, the secondary puller waits for all but one creature to leave then brings the last one back to the group(s).</li>
<p><li>The secondary puller then goes back to his pulling position and Feigns.</li>
<p><li>The primary puller, lots of times, has only to stand to bring creatures back to him as he has not done a Pop-N-Drop.  He then Feigns and the secondary puller repeats step 3 & 4.</li>
<p><li>When creatures no longer come when the primary puller stands he then goes to pull again and the process is repeated.</li>
</ol></ul>
<p>
<center><strong>Tips:</strong></center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Always turn off your auto attack before you Feign</li>
<p><li>Wait for an enemy casters spell to hit you before you Feign</li>
<p><li>Use walls and line-of-sight to help split up multiple casters</li>
<p><li>Teach your healers / buffer / bard when it's ok to cast on you.  Lots of times a Song, Heal or Buff cast on you right as or after you feign can cause all the creatures on you to go after the caster of the spell.</li>
<p><li>Make sure YOU are the only one pulling.  Two pullers not working together can cause lots of trouble.</li>
<p><li>Know what your group can handle.  Sometimes it's OK to bring more than one back.</li>
<p><li>Make sure you know everyone's mana status, especially Healers.</li>
<p><li>Make sure your Healers know if you have Mend recycled or not.  You will have to use it sometimes on a pull that's not going well.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I hope you find the information I have provided useful and that it aids you in becoming a better puller.  As the game evolves I will try to keep any changes that affect the Feign Pull updated and corrected for the proper and most efficient use of our skill.
