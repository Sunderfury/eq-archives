          <span class="blog-item">You say you want a revolution<br><p>I picked up Civilization III on Friday night.  Yeah, yeah, like I don't already have a whole bunch of games, not to mention that I have lots of other things I should be doing.  Anyway, after a bit of fooling around, I've got some opinions to share on this one.<br><p>The original Civilization, a turn-based empire-management/world-conquest classic, was one of my all-time favorites from the days when I used a 386SX-16.  In all its 256-color VGA glory, it managed to provide a compelling challenge that, while being a little bit repetitive in some respects, had the right edge of difficulty to keep me playing "just one more turn".<br><p>Skip the network hack-job of Civ, skip Civ II, skip all that crap with Activision....  and enter Civilization III, several years later.  Obviously inspired by the original, definitely derivative of the original, but certainly no mere sequel.  Civ III has taken the features left out of earlier offerings and melded them beautifully with a well-written, well-designed, and well-crafted game, leaving almost no room for complaint or for improvement.<br><p>Most noteworthy are the artificial intelligence and the diplomacy system.  The AI is crafty and amusing, orders of magnitude better than the original Civ; the diplomacy system permits you to trade with your allies and bicker with your enemies using nearly every imaginable aspect of trade and diplomacy.  Also, the artwork is beautiful, and the in-game music is pleasant (and at times surprising), while not being repetitive enough to make me start to consider turning it off.<br><p>Still, Civ III does have its shortcomings.  First is the obvious lack of multiplayer support.  As easy as socket programming is, and considering that turn-based games don't have the concerns of synchrony that real-time games do, I don't understand why no multiplayer option was included.  There have been vague hints dropped that multiplayer will be added via patch, but such second-chance offerings have historically been poorly-executed.<br><p>Next off is the instruction manual.  Its fifteen chapters span 235 pages - yikes - yet the manual is only useful as a glance-through guide for obscure tidbits of info not presented in the online tutorial and Civilopedia help.  For example, the tech tree is not shown at all in the manual.  The player must use the Civilopedia to find that sort of info - and while the online help is... uh... helpful, it's frightening that 235 pages can be so devoid of useful reference information.  Additionally, the manual's index is pretty much worthless; I think I'm about 0-for-15 on successful index lookups.  On the plus side, the manual does give some information about certain things that are different between Civ III and its predecessors.<br><p>Another problem is the decision-making of your "advisors" - computer-controlled characters that both give you helpful info about the world and help you choose the next thing for your cities to build.  I found myself constantly changing the computer's choice about the next item to build, as it would nearly always choose a military unit even in times of longstanding peace.  Using the automatic "governor" options proved even worse; the governor system makes the choices for you, and despite the fact that I told it never to build military units, I was going back revising its automatic choices every turn, as it kept picking obsolete specialty units instead of useful city improvements.<br><p>Finally, there is an issue with the game speed.  While the amount of processing power required to process a turn's worth of computer player decisions is understandable, the lack of smoothness in scrolling, as well as the horrible rendering speed at higher resolutions (such as 1600x1200) was highly annoying.  Fortunately, the game plays well enough at the default 1280x1024.<br><p>All said, it's still well worth the money - not to mention the many, many hours that one will inevitably spend playing this game.  A definite four-and-a-half steaming turd.<br><p>On a side note....  I'm really glad that I wasn't losing my mind at Cindy's party Saturday night.  A person doesn't live in a place for 18 years and come away knowing nothing compared to someone who only has family there.  So let anyone who wondered know:  Tri-State Airport is in Huntington, and Yeager Airport is in Charleston.  Like I said.  :P</span>
