          <span class="blog-item">Whole lotta nuthin<br><p>That's pretty much what I've done this week.  Nothing.  Well, I take that back.  I've played a lot of Icewind Dale, and probably by this weekend I'll have finished it (and hence will be writing a review that nobody will read because nobody visits my weblog).<br><p>That reminds me.  <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">Terence</a> tells me that to get weblog hits you have to jump through a lot of hoops.  A whole lot.  He says he gets a bunch of hits, but it took him six months and a lot of commentary on other people's lame weblogs to get to that point.  What's the point?  I mean, when I wrote "Where's My Burrito?" I'd get perhaps one or two e-mails about it a week.  I even got links from various other sites that liked it.  But it didn't involve me writing up a bunch of blather about how much cooler I am than you because I have a real job working for a web design company or an ISP, which gives me the time to write up the aforementioned blather.  (I don't even have a real job.)<br><p>So, I'll be writhing in the Pit of Despair, watching my anime and playing my games, while <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">other people</a> discuss Felicity and Friends and interior decorating and Julia Roberts being a great actress, and then wonder aloud why people confuse him for a gay guy.</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Kill me<br><p>Okay, I know it's been, cough cough, almost two months since I've posted.  And I don't plan on making a huge post tonight, either.  I'm just biding about 20 minutes until I can get out of here.<br><p>The semester's over, and I'm stuck grading 65 final exams for the class I've been TA'ing.  In case any of my students happen to read my page - yeah, right - you guys are bombing this thing :)  Okay, perhaps not bombing it.  Some of you are doing pretty well.  But there are a few places where I had to get reeeally generous.  Anyway, if you would like to pick up your graded exams, they will be outside the professor's office door in a box tomorrow afternoon.  I only have one page left to grade, and I should be able to get that done in an hour or two tomorrow morning.<br><p>I certainly hope that everyone in the class enjoyed, uh, the class.  And I hope that my two lectures this semester weren't frightfully boring, although I know of at least a couple people who caught up on their sleep those days....<br><p>Oh, I've been waiting on the third DVD set of <I>Outlaw Star</I> to arrive from Amazon.  It contains the last eight episodes, which includes the last three episodes, which really start rocking.  You get to see the rest of the Anten Seven fight some, except for Tobigera, who's probably a big wuss anyway.  Jukai seriously rules.  There's also the "missing episode" - well, not really missing, but Cartoon Network didn't show it because of the extent to which they'd have to edit the episode to get it fit for the seven-year-olds that this anime was never intended for.<br><p>I'm thinking about putting together an <I>Outlaw Star</I> fan page, and I'm planning on making it a bit more detailed than some of the other pages out there.  Plus, mine would be devoid of ad banners.  If I really wanted to put some detail into it, I could learn Japanese and then try to find the manga that <I>OLS</I> was written from.  There's also a spinoff anime called <I>Angel Links</I>, but I've read very mixed reviews on it - some have said it has as much to do with <I>Outlaw Star</I> as, say, <I>Magical Girl Pretty Sammy</I> has to do with <I>Outlaw Star</I>....<br><p>Also on my future anime purchase list:  <I>Ghost in the Shell</I>, and <I>Akira</I> (out on DVD later this year).  Not sure where to go after that.  I'd like to look more into the cyberpunk-esque flicks like <I>Akira</I>, you know, the ones that smack of <I>Neuromancer</I>, but I don't know which ones are good.  I'm also hoping they put (or have put) <I>Fist of the North Star</I> on DVD, just because I really need an anime flick with <B>exploding heads</B>.<br><p>Okay, I also like <I>Tenchi Muyo</I>.  I think it's hilarious.  The original OAV episodes were, from the action perspective, the best, because more of the characters have some incredible superpowers (especially in the 5th and 6th eps) as compared to the other two series.  I finally managed to see all the episodes of all three series, although I haven't seen any of the additional movies yet.  I know that <I>Tenchi in Tokyo</I> got really sappy and soap-operatic, but that's okay, because I'm secure with myself, considering that I don't dress well and I have no interest in interior decorating.<br><p>The clock has ticked the hour of eleven, and my car is free from the bondage of the $9 parking fee.  I shall take my leave of this place now....</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Foot In Mouth Disease<br><p>Okay, so people have been talking about a distributed computing project where you use spare CPU cycles to run simulations dealing with searching for an HIV vaccine/cure.  They call it "<a href="http://www.fightaidsathome.org/" target="_blank">Fight AIDS @ Home</a>".<br><p>Now, I don't want to seem completely insensitive here.  ...well, okay, actually, I don't give a flying rat fart.  When I see the title "Fight AIDS @ Home", I think, wait a second, I'm fighting AIDS right now, in my very own home, and I don't have to fritter away my precious CPU clocks to do it.  Let's see....  I'm not having unprotected sex with people whose HIV status I don't know (come to think of it, I'm not having sex at all), and I'm not sharing needles for my (nonexistent) intravenous drug habits.  So, I'm doing my part to fight AIDS in my own home.  No AIDS there.  No sirree.<br><p>Because, if <I>everyone</I> fought AIDS at home like that, that'd be the end of it.  No more spread of HIV.  No more AIDS.  The terror disease of the late 20th century would be defeated.  People keep clamoring for a cure, but nobody wants to think about keeping their unit in their pants.  People are dying of AIDS, and by-and-large, it's traceable to one simple fact:  these people couldn't control their body's impulses, and they did something incredibly stupid.  And now they're facing the consequences of their actions.<br><p>So that sounds harsh.  I don't care.  Five-year-olds have a word for this phenomenon:  "Duh".  People - 14-year-old girls, for example - end up on Montel or Maury or Springer because they didn't bother thinking about the connection between sex and pregnancy before they let their boyfriend take advantage of them while neglecting to use a condom.  And the same connection between sex and HIV exists as well, is far more dangerous, and far more difficult to prevent with a condom.<br><p>But AIDS is so easy to prevent with a whit of common sense.  Too bad nobody has that anymore.<br><p>Anyway, my title - "Foot In Mouth Disease" - does bear relevance to this post.  I was reading <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/UK/02/21/foot.mouth/index.html" target="_blank">a page on CNN's web site</a> about foot-and-mouth disease, and the crisis that ensues as it works its way across Europe.  It doesn't affect people, there is a vaccine against it, and the only effects of allowing it to spread are economic as cattle herds become unsuitable for dairy or beef production.  Yet they feel the need to kill and burn cattle by the herd to prevent the spread of this disease.<br><p>On the other hand, AIDS does affect people, is deadly, has no cure, and causes people to waste away to death while they fork over thousands of dollars for drugs to prolong their lives a little while longer.  Almost seems like HIV is a disease far more worthy of wholesale slaughter and corpse-incineration, compared to the relatively innocuous foot-and-mouth.<br><p>So, let's get to work rounding up all the HIV-posi... heh.  Gotta love shock value.  But you see, the entire goal of curing aids by simply throwing money at the problem is ridiculous.  The only reason that companies are trying to find a cure is for money.  Pure green.  They don't care about some guy wasting away in his bed, as long as they can sucker him for thousands of dollars he doesn't have (but that the government is all-too-willing to supply) to keep him alive - whether it be for a month longer or twenty years.  As long as they get their money.  You better believe that the company that creates the cure for AIDS will charge out the nose for it.  <br><p>And it'll work, too.  Ever see those herpes-medication commercials, where the woman says, "Five pills a day?  Who has time for that?"  That commercial makes me sick.  You got herpes because you're an idiot.  Now take your damn pills before I shove them down your throat.  Then you'd have something to whine about.<br><p>That's essentially the reason that some people hold rallies and demonstrations to "fight AIDS".  They're afraid of it, deathly afraid.  And for good reason.  But they're not afraid enough that they'll stop having sex with practically random partners.  Stupidity takes over somewhere between the brain and the loins.  Already, there are reports that some members of high-risk groups have forgotten their responsibility to themselves and to others - their responsibility not to risk the spread of HIV - because they feel safer now that AIDS treatment drugs have improved.  People can almost lead normal lives with HIV because of these drugs, and these people figure that they can go get their rocks off without worries because of the wonders that science and government entitlements have provided them.<br><p>Add all this up, and it makes you wonder why they're not calling it "Fight Idiocy @ Home".</span>

          <span class="blog-item">I killed dozens of enemy soldiers, and all I got was this lousy .avi<br><p>I just finished playing <a href="http://www.project-i-g-i.com/" target="_blank">Project IGI: I'm Going In</a>.  Yeah, yeah, really cheesy title.  It was developed by <a href="http://www.innerloop.com/" target="_blank">Innerloop</a>, a Norwegian game company, and published by <a href="http://www.eidosinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Eidos Interactive</a>, the Tomb Raider people.  Anyway, Project IGI puts you in the role of David Jones, a British-born secret field operative, who must track down both a stolen nuclear warhead and the Estonian mobster who supposedly swiped it.  What's more, the game puts in your hands a deadly arsenal - the details of which Innerloop researched, as the box says, with the help of ex-SAS soldiers.<br><p>That arsenal includes two semi-automatic pistols (Glock 17 and Desert Eagle) and a revolver (Colt Somethingorother .44 mag); two submachine guns (MP5-SD3 and the ever-popular UZI, of which you can brandish two simultaneously); three assault rifles (AK47, M16-A2, and SAW, though I never did find the SAW); two shotguns (Spas-12 and Jackhammer); and a sniper rifle (Dragunov).  In addition, you may find useful the LAW 80 shoulder-launched anti-tank rocket, and various explosive devices like hand grenades, flashbangs, and proximity bombs.  Combine those with the ridiculous amount of intelligence gained by using your variable-zoom binoculars (complete with friend-or-foe color-coded bounding boxes around enemies you can see) and your satellite surveillance, and one man has an almost unfair advantage over the hundreds of enemies you'll blow away playing this game.<br><p>Each of the 14 missions presented by this title starts with an introductory cutscene - fully rendered 3d, not a movie - that shows the tremendously well-designed landscape as you fly, drive, or run to some secluded enemy base, while Anya, your commander and intelligence officer, briefs you on the details of your mission.  Upon completion, your extraction from the mission area is sometimes depicted with another cutscene.<br><p>And the stuff in between is nothing to sneeze at, either.  The terrain is beautifully rendered, and comes into good use - you'll be trudging across a lot of those hills and valleys avoiding detection by enemy snipers situated in watch towers.  From the sky to the buildings, every texture is seamlessly integrated and provides an immersive game environment.  Well.... except for the trees, which look to be inspired by the simplistic tree design in <a href="http://www.everquest.com/" target="_blank">EverQuest</a>'s original installment.<br><p>Each of your weapons has its own specific uses, strengths, and weaknesses; the Dragunov would come in handy throughout the game, but it's not easy to acquire, and even then, you usually have trouble obtaining ammunition for it.  Such balances determine your weapon usage throughout the game, although you can almost depend on having a trusty AK47 available with virtually unlimited ammunition by picking them off of the multitude of corpses you'll make.  But choosing what to kill with is not nearly as critical as how to kill.  Avoiding detection by soldiers standing next to alarm buttons, or surveillance cameras which pan the landscape, will save you grief in the long run; Project IGI spawns soldiers in various locations continually as long as the alarms continue to sound.  Don't let a camera see someone drop to the ground dead, either, or the enemy will be alerted to your presence.<br><p>More difficult mission layouts as the game progresses, combined with an AI that misses less in later missions, gives the game a reasonably good ramp-up of challenge.  On Easy (okay, I'm a big wuss, I'll admit it), some missions may demand several attempts, but never with such brutality as to seem impossible.  In addition, the enemy AI behaves smarter in the later missions; soldiers start hitting the deck when they come under fire, and then even fire at you from a prone position.<br><p>The game does have its shortcomings, however.  Most notable is the complete absence of a save game feature, although in similar games for console systems, saving your game is also impossible during a mission.  Still, considering that the competition is against the computer, and not a human opponent (there is no network option, either, sadly enough), having a save game option does not detract from the challenge the game presents.<br><p>Considering the lack of a save game option, when you're killed, you are forced to start the mission from the beginning.  Since the game revolves so much around having good intelligence - I mean knowing where your enemies are, stupid - repeat attempts are usually far easier than the original try.<br><p>Another problem is that Project IGI, though it's written under DirectX 7.0a, occasionally forgot to load all the textures for the mission.  If one mission was completed while this bug was occurring, the next mission generally got worse, until eventually you couldn't see where you were going (all the missing textures were replaced with an unshaded white).  Exiting the game and re-entering solved the problem, but considering the lack of a save game feature....<br><p>The game also was riddled with spelling errors.  Portions of the dialogue between Jones and Anya contained misspellings, the manual was rife with typos, and even one of the mission names was spelled incorrectly!  Quite a surprise that the QA people credited in the manual didn't catch any of these - or perhaps the release date was considered more important than waiting a day and fixing those embarrassing problems.<br><p>Finally - and I hate to give away the ending here - the closing cinematic sucked.  Perhaps it was a poor attempt at tying in a potential sequel, but you go through all these great rendered cutscenes expecting a tremendous ending, only to be thanked for your efforts at saving the world with a thirty-second AVI.  Certainly a let-down.  Along those same lines, the game and manual provided only a rudimentary plot, and the feeble attempts at character development were left completely unaddressed in the ending.<br><p>All in all, however, I did enjoy playing Project IGI: I'm Going In - quite a surprise, since I won it from <a href="http://www.avault.com/" target="_blank">Adrenaline Vault</a>, and the last thing I won from them was the ever-horrendous Men In Black.  Though I have doubts of the immediate replay value of Project IGI, I may go back and play it again a few months down the road.  I give this game (on a scale of five)&nbsp;<img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif">.</span>
