What gives is that <a href="http://home.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">home.cwru.edu</a> doesn't support any sort of server-side scripting, and so, I can't add dynamic content to the page.  That means that all the content of the menu pane would have to go on my Blogger template and get published every time I post, not to mention that changing the menu pane would really, really suck.<br><p>Personally, I don't care enough to convince the SIS people to add a server-side scripting facility, but by all means, feel free to work on that on my behalf....</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Tactics, schmactics<br><p>I almost forgot to respond to the comments over on Fluggart about "real-time tactics" not being a valid genre...  Of course it is.  Not many games qualify for the genre - Myth and Myth 2 do - but the idea is that RTSes involve a higher level of management (on a strategic scale) whereas RTTs require only a local, tactical level of management.<br><p>The difference is primarily in the harvesting of resources and construction of facilities to produce units.<br><p>Other games that might prove a good example of the difference between tactical and strategic games:<br><p>Master of Orion.  Definitely a strategic game.  The actual tactical portion of the game is very weak (move your ships around on a grid - 8x8 or so?), but is primarily about gaining resources and constructing ships/developing technologies to operate a strategic plan.<br><p>X-Com.  Almost entirely tactical.  There are some non-tactical aspects to X-Com, but they're far, far outweighed by the lengthy turn-based battles involving moving individual people around and instructing them when to fire and what to fire at.<br><p>Starcraft.  It's been classed as a RTS, for good reason.  Managing a battle in Starcraft is possible, but is akin to herding cats.  Most games of Starcraft are won by superior resource management and initial build order.<br><p>Mechwarrior (any of them).  This game, while both real-time and tactical, is also first-person perspective.  It probably also gets classed as either a FPS or a sim.  However, it should be noted that the action contained therein is almost completely tactical - ordering your lancemates around and such - and completely lacks a strategic aspect (you don't even get to choose what missions to do).<br><p>Quake.  Well, this game lacks the strategic aspect, and comes very close to being devoid of any tactical aspect as well.  This is due primarily to the near-complete lack of penalty for getting killed.  As my roommate would say, this is a "twitch game".<br><p>Hence, MechCommander 2 being a RTT isn't just some marketing ploy - it's descriptive of what sort of game it is, and can be indicative of what sorts of gamers will enjoy it.</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Express elevator to Hell, going down<br><p>I must have some sort of deeply-repressed fear of elevators or something.  Nearly every time that an elevator shows up in a dream, it isn't there just so I can get from place to place - it's there to scare the&nbsp;<img src="images/turd.gif">&nbsp;out of me.<br><p>In fact, I just woke up moments ago after having a bad elevator-in-a-dream experience.  I was in Glennan, the building where I spend most of my time on-campus, and two friends from the office were with me.  We were heading down to 2 from 5, I think, so we went to the elevator.  When we got there, the elevator doors were open, and I could see that it had been changed significantly.  The walls of the elevator were a dirty white color, with green tile or paneling starting at about handrail level and going to the floor.  The floor of the elevator was more like a metal plate or tray that didn't even fill the floorspace of the elevator.  Other aspects were different, and the implication in the dream was that the elevator was new.  So, we got in - realizing that the floor of the elevator was about two inches below the floor we were on - and the doors closed.<br><p>Then it felt like everything let go.<br><p>As the elevator plummeted, my feet nearly came off the floor - sort of that feeling you get as a roller-coaster goes over a hill.  But the floors didn't click off all that fast.  4... 3... 2... I was expecting it to stop (because it should have) but it went on to 1.  When the doors opened, we were all three a little stunned at the incredible speed of the elevator, so we decided to hoof it back up to 2 rather than tempt fate.<br><p>Strangely enough, we ended up outside, on a shallow incline where a number of buildings were perched alongside a street.  Instead of going up any stairs, we walked up to the next building; one of the familiar CWRU signs was there, except it proudly proclaimed something about a Nobel Prize museum.  We went in, and there were maybe twenty small exhibits of miscellany (I didn't examine any of them closely, and doing so would likely have woken me up) set up on tables.  At some point, it turned into a small banquet, but that was just as I was waking up anyway....<br><p>I've had many, many dreams about getting in an elevator - always some rickety, foreboding contraption - and having it plummet or, better yet, tilt dangerously, usually while I'm inside.  They always speed toward their destination, and occasionally they kill me, causing me to awaken with an eerie numb feeling.  This is really strange, because I'm not scared of elevators at all in the waking world, and I only get a slight rush from peering over a long drop.  Roller coasters aren't even as bad as they were years ago - the only part that ends up getting me is the agonizingly slow trip up, especially when there are no guard rails along the initial incline.  And airplanes don't bother me in the least, either.<br><p>Anyway, my sleep schedule is all screwed up.  I've been getting in a three-hour nap from midnight to 3 am, and sleeping five or six hours in the middle of the day.  This is bad, because on Tuesday and Thursday, I have class from 1:15 to 4:00 pm, starting, uh, later today.  What's more, any attempt I've made to get more sleep at night has been foiled by the worrying that I won't be able to get enough sleep to get through the next day comfortably.  Lying in bed worrying about getting enough sleep is usually a sure-fire way not to.</span>
