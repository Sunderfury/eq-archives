          <span class="blog-item">Kill me<br><p>Okay, I know it's been, cough cough, almost two months since I've posted.  And I don't plan on making a huge post tonight, either.  I'm just biding about 20 minutes until I can get out of here.<br><p>The semester's over, and I'm stuck grading 65 final exams for the class I've been TA'ing.  In case any of my students happen to read my page - yeah, right - you guys are bombing this thing :)  Okay, perhaps not bombing it.  Some of you are doing pretty well.  But there are a few places where I had to get reeeally generous.  Anyway, if you would like to pick up your graded exams, they will be outside the professor's office door in a box tomorrow afternoon.  I only have one page left to grade, and I should be able to get that done in an hour or two tomorrow morning.<br><p>I certainly hope that everyone in the class enjoyed, uh, the class.  And I hope that my two lectures this semester weren't frightfully boring, although I know of at least a couple people who caught up on their sleep those days....<br><p>Oh, I've been waiting on the third DVD set of <I>Outlaw Star</I> to arrive from Amazon.  It contains the last eight episodes, which includes the last three episodes, which really start rocking.  You get to see the rest of the Anten Seven fight some, except for Tobigera, who's probably a big wuss anyway.  Jukai seriously rules.  There's also the "missing episode" - well, not really missing, but Cartoon Network didn't show it because of the extent to which they'd have to edit the episode to get it fit for the seven-year-olds that this anime was never intended for.<br><p>I'm thinking about putting together an <I>Outlaw Star</I> fan page, and I'm planning on making it a bit more detailed than some of the other pages out there.  Plus, mine would be devoid of ad banners.  If I really wanted to put some detail into it, I could learn Japanese and then try to find the manga that <I>OLS</I> was written from.  There's also a spinoff anime called <I>Angel Links</I>, but I've read very mixed reviews on it - some have said it has as much to do with <I>Outlaw Star</I> as, say, <I>Magical Girl Pretty Sammy</I> has to do with <I>Outlaw Star</I>....<br><p>Also on my future anime purchase list:  <I>Ghost in the Shell</I>, and <I>Akira</I> (out on DVD later this year).  Not sure where to go after that.  I'd like to look more into the cyberpunk-esque flicks like <I>Akira</I>, you know, the ones that smack of <I>Neuromancer</I>, but I don't know which ones are good.  I'm also hoping they put (or have put) <I>Fist of the North Star</I> on DVD, just because I really need an anime flick with <B>exploding heads</B>.<br><p>Okay, I also like <I>Tenchi Muyo</I>.  I think it's hilarious.  The original OAV episodes were, from the action perspective, the best, because more of the characters have some incredible superpowers (especially in the 5th and 6th eps) as compared to the other two series.  I finally managed to see all the episodes of all three series, although I haven't seen any of the additional movies yet.  I know that <I>Tenchi in Tokyo</I> got really sappy and soap-operatic, but that's okay, because I'm secure with myself, considering that I don't dress well and I have no interest in interior decorating.<br><p>The clock has ticked the hour of eleven, and my car is free from the bondage of the $9 parking fee.  I shall take my leave of this place now....</span>
