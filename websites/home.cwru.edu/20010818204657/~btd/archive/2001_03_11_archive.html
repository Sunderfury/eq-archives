          <span class="blog-item">Foot In Mouth Disease<br><p>Okay, so people have been talking about a distributed computing project where you use spare CPU cycles to run simulations dealing with searching for an HIV vaccine/cure.  They call it "<a href="http://www.fightaidsathome.org/" target="_blank">Fight AIDS @ Home</a>".<br><p>Now, I don't want to seem completely insensitive here.  ...well, okay, actually, I don't give a flying rat fart.  When I see the title "Fight AIDS @ Home", I think, wait a second, I'm fighting AIDS right now, in my very own home, and I don't have to fritter away my precious CPU clocks to do it.  Let's see....  I'm not having unprotected sex with people whose HIV status I don't know (come to think of it, I'm not having sex at all), and I'm not sharing needles for my (nonexistent) intravenous drug habits.  So, I'm doing my part to fight AIDS in my own home.  No AIDS there.  No sirree.<br><p>Because, if <I>everyone</I> fought AIDS at home like that, that'd be the end of it.  No more spread of HIV.  No more AIDS.  The terror disease of the late 20th century would be defeated.  People keep clamoring for a cure, but nobody wants to think about keeping their unit in their pants.  People are dying of AIDS, and by-and-large, it's traceable to one simple fact:  these people couldn't control their body's impulses, and they did something incredibly stupid.  And now they're facing the consequences of their actions.<br><p>So that sounds harsh.  I don't care.  Five-year-olds have a word for this phenomenon:  "Duh".  People - 14-year-old girls, for example - end up on Montel or Maury or Springer because they didn't bother thinking about the connection between sex and pregnancy before they let their boyfriend take advantage of them while neglecting to use a condom.  And the same connection between sex and HIV exists as well, is far more dangerous, and far more difficult to prevent with a condom.<br><p>But AIDS is so easy to prevent with a whit of common sense.  Too bad nobody has that anymore.<br><p>Anyway, my title - "Foot In Mouth Disease" - does bear relevance to this post.  I was reading <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/UK/02/21/foot.mouth/index.html" target="_blank">a page on CNN's web site</a> about foot-and-mouth disease, and the crisis that ensues as it works its way across Europe.  It doesn't affect people, there is a vaccine against it, and the only effects of allowing it to spread are economic as cattle herds become unsuitable for dairy or beef production.  Yet they feel the need to kill and burn cattle by the herd to prevent the spread of this disease.<br><p>On the other hand, AIDS does affect people, is deadly, has no cure, and causes people to waste away to death while they fork over thousands of dollars for drugs to prolong their lives a little while longer.  Almost seems like HIV is a disease far more worthy of wholesale slaughter and corpse-incineration, compared to the relatively innocuous foot-and-mouth.<br><p>So, let's get to work rounding up all the HIV-posi... heh.  Gotta love shock value.  But you see, the entire goal of curing aids by simply throwing money at the problem is ridiculous.  The only reason that companies are trying to find a cure is for money.  Pure green.  They don't care about some guy wasting away in his bed, as long as they can sucker him for thousands of dollars he doesn't have (but that the government is all-too-willing to supply) to keep him alive - whether it be for a month longer or twenty years.  As long as they get their money.  You better believe that the company that creates the cure for AIDS will charge out the nose for it.  <br><p>And it'll work, too.  Ever see those herpes-medication commercials, where the woman says, "Five pills a day?  Who has time for that?"  That commercial makes me sick.  You got herpes because you're an idiot.  Now take your damn pills before I shove them down your throat.  Then you'd have something to whine about.<br><p>That's essentially the reason that some people hold rallies and demonstrations to "fight AIDS".  They're afraid of it, deathly afraid.  And for good reason.  But they're not afraid enough that they'll stop having sex with practically random partners.  Stupidity takes over somewhere between the brain and the loins.  Already, there are reports that some members of high-risk groups have forgotten their responsibility to themselves and to others - their responsibility not to risk the spread of HIV - because they feel safer now that AIDS treatment drugs have improved.  People can almost lead normal lives with HIV because of these drugs, and these people figure that they can go get their rocks off without worries because of the wonders that science and government entitlements have provided them.<br><p>Add all this up, and it makes you wonder why they're not calling it "Fight Idiocy @ Home".</span>
