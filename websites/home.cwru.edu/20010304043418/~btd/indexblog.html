          <span class="blog-item">I killed dozens of enemy soldiers, and all I got was this lousy .avi<br><p>I just finished playing <a href="http://www.project-i-g-i.com/" target="_blank">Project IGI: I'm Going In</a>.  Yeah, yeah, really cheesy title.  It was developed by <a href="http://www.innerloop.com/" target="_blank">Innerloop</a>, a Norwegian game company, and published by <a href="http://www.eidosinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Eidos Interactive</a>, the Tomb Raider people.  Anyway, Project IGI puts you in the role of David Jones, a British-born secret field operative, who must track down both a stolen nuclear warhead and the Estonian mobster who supposedly swiped it.  What's more, the game puts in your hands a deadly arsenal - the details of which Innerloop researched, as the box says, with the help of ex-SAS soldiers.<br><p>That arsenal includes two semi-automatic pistols (Glock 17 and Desert Eagle) and a revolver (Colt Somethingorother .44 mag); two submachine guns (MP5-SD3 and the ever-popular UZI, of which you can brandish two simultaneously); three assault rifles (AK47, M16-A2, and SAW, though I never did find the SAW); two shotguns (Spas-12 and Jackhammer); and a sniper rifle (Dragunov).  In addition, you may find useful the LAW 80 shoulder-launched anti-tank rocket, and various explosive devices like hand grenades, flashbangs, and proximity bombs.  Combine those with the ridiculous amount of intelligence gained by using your variable-zoom binoculars (complete with friend-or-foe color-coded bounding boxes around enemies you can see) and your satellite surveillance, and one man has an almost unfair advantage over the hundreds of enemies you'll blow away playing this game.<br><p>Each of the 14 missions presented by this title starts with an introductory cutscene - fully rendered 3d, not a movie - that shows the tremendously well-designed landscape as you fly, drive, or run to some secluded enemy base, while Anya, your commander and intelligence officer, briefs you on the details of your mission.  Upon completion, your extraction from the mission area is sometimes depicted with another cutscene.<br><p>And the stuff in between is nothing to sneeze at, either.  The terrain is beautifully rendered, and comes into good use - you'll be trudging across a lot of those hills and valleys avoiding detection by enemy snipers situated in watch towers.  From the sky to the buildings, every texture is seamlessly integrated and provides an immersive game environment.  Well.... except for the trees, which look to be inspired by the simplistic tree design in <a href="http://www.everquest.com/" target="_blank">EverQuest</a>'s original installment.<br><p>Each of your weapons has its own specific uses, strengths, and weaknesses; the Dragunov would come in handy throughout the game, but it's not easy to acquire, and even then, you usually have trouble obtaining ammunition for it.  Such balances determine your weapon usage throughout the game, although you can almost depend on having a trusty AK47 available with virtually unlimited ammunition by picking them off of the multitude of corpses you'll make.  But choosing what to kill with is not nearly as critical as how to kill.  Avoiding detection by soldiers standing next to alarm buttons, or surveillance cameras which pan the landscape, will save you grief in the long run; Project IGI spawns soldiers in various locations continually as long as the alarms continue to sound.  Don't let a camera see someone drop to the ground dead, either, or the enemy will be alerted to your presence.<br><p>More difficult mission layouts as the game progresses, combined with an AI that misses less in later missions, gives the game a reasonably good ramp-up of challenge.  On Easy (okay, I'm a big wuss, I'll admit it), some missions may demand several attempts, but never with such brutality as to seem impossible.  In addition, the enemy AI behaves smarter in the later missions; soldiers start hitting the deck when they come under fire, and then even fire at you from a prone position.<br><p>The game does have its shortcomings, however.  Most notable is the complete absence of a save game feature, although in similar games for console systems, saving your game is also impossible during a mission.  Still, considering that the competition is against the computer, and not a human opponent (there is no network option, either, sadly enough), having a save game option does not detract from the challenge the game presents.<br><p>Considering the lack of a save game option, when you're killed, you are forced to start the mission from the beginning.  Since the game revolves so much around having good intelligence - I mean knowing where your enemies are, stupid - repeat attempts are usually far easier than the original try.<br><p>Another problem is that Project IGI, though it's written under DirectX 7.0a, occasionally forgot to load all the textures for the mission.  If one mission was completed while this bug was occurring, the next mission generally got worse, until eventually you couldn't see where you were going (all the missing textures were replaced with an unshaded white).  Exiting the game and re-entering solved the problem, but considering the lack of a save game feature....<br><p>The game also was riddled with spelling errors.  Portions of the dialogue between Jones and Anya contained misspellings, the manual was rife with typos, and even one of the mission names was spelled incorrectly!  Quite a surprise that the QA people credited in the manual didn't catch any of these - or perhaps the release date was considered more important than waiting a day and fixing those embarrassing problems.<br><p>Finally - and I hate to give away the ending here - the closing cinematic sucked.  Perhaps it was a poor attempt at tying in a potential sequel, but you go through all these great rendered cutscenes expecting a tremendous ending, only to be thanked for your efforts at saving the world with a thirty-second AVI.  Certainly a let-down.  Along those same lines, the game and manual provided only a rudimentary plot, and the feeble attempts at character development were left completely unaddressed in the ending.<br><p>All in all, however, I did enjoy playing Project IGI: I'm Going In - quite a surprise, since I won it from <a href="http://www.avault.com/" target="_blank">Adrenaline Vault</a>, and the last thing I won from them was the ever-horrendous Men In Black.  Though I have doubts of the immediate replay value of Project IGI, I may go back and play it again a few months down the road.  I give this game (on a scale of five)&nbsp;<img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif">.</span>

It's in response to <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2001_0117.html" target="_blank">this post</a> that my friend at <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2001_0117.html" target="_blank">Fluggart</a> posted on his weblog, located <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2001_0117.html" target="_blank">here</a>, at <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2001_0117.html" target="_blank">Fluggart</a>.<br><p>I have fixed the problem with no home-going link on the archive pages.  What gives is that <a href="http://home.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">home.cwru.edu</a> doesn't support any sort of server-side scripting, and so, I can't add dynamic content to the page.  That means that all the content of the menu pane would have to go on my Blogger template and get published every time I post, not to mention that changing the menu pane would really, really suck.<br><p>Personally, I don't care enough to convince the SIS people to add a server-side scripting facility, but by all means, feel free to work on that on my behalf....</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Tactics, schmactics<br><p>I almost forgot to respond to the comments over on Fluggart about "real-time tactics" not being a valid genre...  Of course it is.  Not many games qualify for the genre - Myth and Myth 2 do - but the idea is that RTSes involve a higher level of management (on a strategic scale) whereas RTTs require only a local, tactical level of management.<br><p>The difference is primarily in the harvesting of resources and construction of facilities to produce units.<br><p>Other games that might prove a good example of the difference between tactical and strategic games:<br><p>Master of Orion.  Definitely a strategic game.  The actual tactical portion of the game is very weak (move your ships around on a grid - 8x8 or so?), but is primarily about gaining resources and constructing ships/developing technologies to operate a strategic plan.<br><p>X-Com.  Almost entirely tactical.  There are some non-tactical aspects to X-Com, but they're far, far outweighed by the lengthy turn-based battles involving moving individual people around and instructing them when to fire and what to fire at.<br><p>Starcraft.  It's been classed as a RTS, for good reason.  Managing a battle in Starcraft is possible, but is akin to herding cats.  Most games of Starcraft are won by superior resource management and initial build order.<br><p>Mechwarrior (any of them).  This game, while both real-time and tactical, is also first-person perspective.  It probably also gets classed as either a FPS or a sim.  However, it should be noted that the action contained therein is almost completely tactical - ordering your lancemates around and such - and completely lacks a strategic aspect (you don't even get to choose what missions to do).<br><p>Quake.  Well, this game lacks the strategic aspect, and comes very close to being devoid of any tactical aspect as well.  This is due primarily to the near-complete lack of penalty for getting killed.  As my roommate would say, this is a "twitch game".<br><p>Hence, MechCommander 2 being a RTT isn't just some marketing ploy - it's descriptive of what sort of game it is, and can be indicative of what sorts of gamers will enjoy it.</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Express elevator to Hell, going down<br><p>I must have some sort of deeply-repressed fear of elevators or something.  Nearly every time that an elevator shows up in a dream, it isn't there just so I can get from place to place - it's there to scare the&nbsp;<img src="images/turd.gif">&nbsp;out of me.<br><p>In fact, I just woke up moments ago after having a bad elevator-in-a-dream experience.  I was in Glennan, the building where I spend most of my time on-campus, and two friends from the office were with me.  We were heading down to 2 from 5, I think, so we went to the elevator.  When we got there, the elevator doors were open, and I could see that it had been changed significantly.  The walls of the elevator were a dirty white color, with green tile or paneling starting at about handrail level and going to the floor.  The floor of the elevator was more like a metal plate or tray that didn't even fill the floorspace of the elevator.  Other aspects were different, and the implication in the dream was that the elevator was new.  So, we got in - realizing that the floor of the elevator was about two inches below the floor we were on - and the doors closed.<br><p>Then it felt like everything let go.<br><p>As the elevator plummeted, my feet nearly came off the floor - sort of that feeling you get as a roller-coaster goes over a hill.  But the floors didn't click off all that fast.  4... 3... 2... I was expecting it to stop (because it should have) but it went on to 1.  When the doors opened, we were all three a little stunned at the incredible speed of the elevator, so we decided to hoof it back up to 2 rather than tempt fate.<br><p>Strangely enough, we ended up outside, on a shallow incline where a number of buildings were perched alongside a street.  Instead of going up any stairs, we walked up to the next building; one of the familiar CWRU signs was there, except it proudly proclaimed something about a Nobel Prize museum.  We went in, and there were maybe twenty small exhibits of miscellany (I didn't examine any of them closely, and doing so would likely have woken me up) set up on tables.  At some point, it turned into a small banquet, but that was just as I was waking up anyway....<br><p>I've had many, many dreams about getting in an elevator - always some rickety, foreboding contraption - and having it plummet or, better yet, tilt dangerously, usually while I'm inside.  They always speed toward their destination, and occasionally they kill me, causing me to awaken with an eerie numb feeling.  This is really strange, because I'm not scared of elevators at all in the waking world, and I only get a slight rush from peering over a long drop.  Roller coasters aren't even as bad as they were years ago - the only part that ends up getting me is the agonizingly slow trip up, especially when there are no guard rails along the initial incline.  And airplanes don't bother me in the least, either.<br><p>Anyway, my sleep schedule is all screwed up.  I've been getting in a three-hour nap from midnight to 3 am, and sleeping five or six hours in the middle of the day.  This is bad, because on Tuesday and Thursday, I have class from 1:15 to 4:00 pm, starting, uh, later today.  What's more, any attempt I've made to get more sleep at night has been foiled by the worrying that I won't be able to get enough sleep to get through the next day comfortably.  Lying in bed worrying about getting enough sleep is usually a sure-fire way not to.</span>
