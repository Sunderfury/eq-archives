          <span class="blog-item">Where is it!<br><p>So I'm an avid <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/">EverQuest</a> player.  Perhaps not as avid as some, but I'm entering a rite of passage of sorts - my first ridiculously long, painful, and very boring camp.<br><p>What's a camp, you might ask?  Well, in EQ, in order to improve your character's abilities, you kill stuff.  Lots of stuff.  An old character may have thousands of kills under his belt, some of which required the collaboration of dozens of players to achieve.  Anyway, there are two ways you improve through the killing of stuff:  experience (mad xps) and equipment (phat lewts).  But sometimes the lewts require the combination of various non-usable items which are "dropped" by various critters.  To limit the influx of lewts into the game, the designers thoughtfully limited the frequency with which critters appear.  Some of these are limited severely, with spawn times ranging all the way up to days and days.  The one I'm after - <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3672">Grizzleknot</a> - isn't nearly that bad.  From what I can tell, the spawn time is nonspecific, meaning you kill "placeholders" in the zone until it shows up.  That means there isn't a certain amount of time I have to wait, which has mixed effects - I may only have to wait a few minutes, if I'm really lucky, but I can't time my arrival based on the last time it appeared (which also means others can't as well, so the competition won't be as fierce).  Additionally, though, the spawn location is randomly selected from several places in the zone.  It's not a small zone, either.  I made a ranger on a second account with the tracking ability to assist in finding this guy.  Finally, once Grizzleknot spawns, he starts wandering around the zone.  All in all, these factors make this a difficult and really annoying thing to camp for, especially since I can't just sit in one place.<br><p>End result?  I've spent about 30 hours in the past week looking for him.  And I'm still looking.<br></span>

          <span class="blog-item">Glug glug cough cough cough glug glug<br><p>I've been victim, for the past nine days, to perhaps the oddest illness I've ever had.  It started off Sunday before last, with a slight scratchy throat in the morning and a bit of a hoarse voice.  Well, that sucks, I thought, but maybe it'll go away.<br><p>It didn't.<br><p>We played Advanced Civ that afternoon... and evening... and night... and well into the night... and the whole time, my voice steadily got worse and worse and worse.  On Monday, it was still bad, still with a slight sore throat, but we played D&D, and six more hours of me talking a lot while DMing meant my voice was really shot by the end of it.  Since then, I've had a runny nose, a sore throat, horrible voice, and a mucus-expelling cough which got really bad around Wednesday and stayed bad through Saturday.  Eventually, the mucus died down, but the cough stayed.  To make matters worse, I think for whatever reason I'm also salivating too much, and when I try to sleep I end up aspirating a bit of it, and then that wakes me up and I start coughing a bunch.  Sometimes it's about two minutes after I lie down, and sometimes I can get a couple hours in first.<br><p>I think I'm on the tail end of it now, though.  The coughing hasn't been nearly as bad - I seem to be coughing mainly only when I say something, as that irritates my vocal cords - and the sore throat is completely gone.  Hopefully it'll be gone all the way very very soon.  <br><p>I miss having a normal voice.  :(<br></span>

          <span class="blog-item">The Prodigal Weblog<br><p>So I haven't written to this weblog in a long time.  A really long time.  In fact, I look down at the previous entry and realize the time between that entry and this one was seven months.  Sorry 'bout that....  :)<br><p>Anyway, I'm thinking maybe I need to get back to weblogging a bit.  Why?  Well, it's a long story.  But I'll tell it.  In fact, this is one of those long stories - a convoluted, yet somehow chained, series of nearly unrelated events that when I tell my friends about my line of thought, they usually tell me to shut up.  Well, except for T at <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/">Fluggart</a>, who would just threaten to kill me again.  Funny that I'm somehow still alive....<br><p>So, the other day, I (for some random and unknown reason) checked the hit logs on home.cwru.edu, this site's esteemed provider.  They give info on various stats, but most interesting to me is url accesses.  Well, I keep my bookmarks on a web page on home (you can access it at the left if the menu pane is up), and I was almost surprised to see it had made the list as the second to last item.<br><p>Fast forward a few days - to this morning - and I decide to see if my bookmarks are listed on Google.  And indeed they are!  Wow, that's pretty amazing, I suppose.  I figure they actually got linked through Fluggart, much previously, but no matter.  Because of this, I wanted to see if I could come up with a Googlewhack for it :)  Anyway, the closest one on there is "steaming rantmonkey", but rantmonkey isn't a real word, so it doesn't technically count.  A close second-place loser is "steaming fluggart", which references my bookmarks, my weblog, and <a href="http://rejemy.dreamwing.com/">this weblog</a> maintained by an acquaintance.  (Strange that Fluggart wasn't listed there.  Oh yeah.  That's because he delinked me about a year and a half ago.  :P )<br><p>Well, that's what brings me to this point, the fact that after all this time, an acquaintance of mine still has my weblog on his links page.  And somehow I feel like I'm failing or something, by not writing for months on end.  So perhaps, if I write just a little each day, I'll be able to keep on this and have a (somewhat) amusing-to-read weblog.<br><p>Naaaah.<br><p></span>
