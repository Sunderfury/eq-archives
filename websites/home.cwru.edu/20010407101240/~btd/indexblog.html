          <span class="blog-item">Foot In Mouth Disease<br><p>Okay, so people have been talking about a distributed computing project where you use spare CPU cycles to run simulations dealing with searching for an HIV vaccine/cure.  They call it "<a href="http://www.fightaidsathome.org/" target="_blank">Fight AIDS @ Home</a>".<br><p>Now, I don't want to seem completely insensitive here.  ...well, okay, actually, I don't give a flying rat fart.  When I see the title "Fight AIDS @ Home", I think, wait a second, I'm fighting AIDS right now, in my very own home, and I don't have to fritter away my precious CPU clocks to do it.  Let's see....  I'm not having unprotected sex with people whose HIV status I don't know (come to think of it, I'm not having sex at all), and I'm not sharing needles for my (nonexistent) intravenous drug habits.  So, I'm doing my part to fight AIDS in my own home.  No AIDS there.  No sirree.<br><p>Because, if <I>everyone</I> fought AIDS at home like that, that'd be the end of it.  No more spread of HIV.  No more AIDS.  The terror disease of the late 20th century would be defeated.  People keep clamoring for a cure, but nobody wants to think about keeping their unit in their pants.  People are dying of AIDS, and by-and-large, it's traceable to one simple fact:  these people couldn't control their body's impulses, and they did something incredibly stupid.  And now they're facing the consequences of their actions.<br><p>So that sounds harsh.  I don't care.  Five-year-olds have a word for this phenomenon:  "Duh".  People - 14-year-old girls, for example - end up on Montel or Maury or Springer because they didn't bother thinking about the connection between sex and pregnancy before they let their boyfriend take advantage of them while neglecting to use a condom.  And the same connection between sex and HIV exists as well, is far more dangerous, and far more difficult to prevent with a condom.<br><p>But AIDS is so easy to prevent with a whit of common sense.  Too bad nobody has that anymore.<br><p>Anyway, my title - "Foot In Mouth Disease" - does bear relevance to this post.  I was reading <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/UK/02/21/foot.mouth/index.html" target="_blank">a page on CNN's web site</a> about foot-and-mouth disease, and the crisis that ensues as it works its way across Europe.  It doesn't affect people, there is a vaccine against it, and the only effects of allowing it to spread are economic as cattle herds become unsuitable for dairy or beef production.  Yet they feel the need to kill and burn cattle by the herd to prevent the spread of this disease.<br><p>On the other hand, AIDS does affect people, is deadly, has no cure, and causes people to waste away to death while they fork over thousands of dollars for drugs to prolong their lives a little while longer.  Almost seems like HIV is a disease far more worthy of wholesale slaughter and corpse-incineration, compared to the relatively innocuous foot-and-mouth.<br><p>So, let's get to work rounding up all the HIV-posi... heh.  Gotta love shock value.  But you see, the entire goal of curing aids by simply throwing money at the problem is ridiculous.  The only reason that companies are trying to find a cure is for money.  Pure green.  They don't care about some guy wasting away in his bed, as long as they can sucker him for thousands of dollars he doesn't have (but that the government is all-too-willing to supply) to keep him alive - whether it be for a month longer or twenty years.  As long as they get their money.  You better believe that the company that creates the cure for AIDS will charge out the nose for it.  <br><p>And it'll work, too.  Ever see those herpes-medication commercials, where the woman says, "Five pills a day?  Who has time for that?"  That commercial makes me sick.  You got herpes because you're an idiot.  Now take your damn pills before I shove them down your throat.  Then you'd have something to whine about.<br><p>That's essentially the reason that some people hold rallies and demonstrations to "fight AIDS".  They're afraid of it, deathly afraid.  And for good reason.  But they're not afraid enough that they'll stop having sex with practically random partners.  Stupidity takes over somewhere between the brain and the loins.  Already, there are reports that some members of high-risk groups have forgotten their responsibility to themselves and to others - their responsibility not to risk the spread of HIV - because they feel safer now that AIDS treatment drugs have improved.  People can almost lead normal lives with HIV because of these drugs, and these people figure that they can go get their rocks off without worries because of the wonders that science and government entitlements have provided them.<br><p>Add all this up, and it makes you wonder why they're not calling it "Fight Idiocy @ Home".</span>

          <span class="blog-item">I killed dozens of enemy soldiers, and all I got was this lousy .avi<br><p>I just finished playing <a href="http://www.project-i-g-i.com/" target="_blank">Project IGI: I'm Going In</a>.  Yeah, yeah, really cheesy title.  It was developed by <a href="http://www.innerloop.com/" target="_blank">Innerloop</a>, a Norwegian game company, and published by <a href="http://www.eidosinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Eidos Interactive</a>, the Tomb Raider people.  Anyway, Project IGI puts you in the role of David Jones, a British-born secret field operative, who must track down both a stolen nuclear warhead and the Estonian mobster who supposedly swiped it.  What's more, the game puts in your hands a deadly arsenal - the details of which Innerloop researched, as the box says, with the help of ex-SAS soldiers.<br><p>That arsenal includes two semi-automatic pistols (Glock 17 and Desert Eagle) and a revolver (Colt Somethingorother .44 mag); two submachine guns (MP5-SD3 and the ever-popular UZI, of which you can brandish two simultaneously); three assault rifles (AK47, M16-A2, and SAW, though I never did find the SAW); two shotguns (Spas-12 and Jackhammer); and a sniper rifle (Dragunov).  In addition, you may find useful the LAW 80 shoulder-launched anti-tank rocket, and various explosive devices like hand grenades, flashbangs, and proximity bombs.  Combine those with the ridiculous amount of intelligence gained by using your variable-zoom binoculars (complete with friend-or-foe color-coded bounding boxes around enemies you can see) and your satellite surveillance, and one man has an almost unfair advantage over the hundreds of enemies you'll blow away playing this game.<br><p>Each of the 14 missions presented by this title starts with an introductory cutscene - fully rendered 3d, not a movie - that shows the tremendously well-designed landscape as you fly, drive, or run to some secluded enemy base, while Anya, your commander and intelligence officer, briefs you on the details of your mission.  Upon completion, your extraction from the mission area is sometimes depicted with another cutscene.<br><p>And the stuff in between is nothing to sneeze at, either.  The terrain is beautifully rendered, and comes into good use - you'll be trudging across a lot of those hills and valleys avoiding detection by enemy snipers situated in watch towers.  From the sky to the buildings, every texture is seamlessly integrated and provides an immersive game environment.  Well.... except for the trees, which look to be inspired by the simplistic tree design in <a href="http://www.everquest.com/" target="_blank">EverQuest</a>'s original installment.<br><p>Each of your weapons has its own specific uses, strengths, and weaknesses; the Dragunov would come in handy throughout the game, but it's not easy to acquire, and even then, you usually have trouble obtaining ammunition for it.  Such balances determine your weapon usage throughout the game, although you can almost depend on having a trusty AK47 available with virtually unlimited ammunition by picking them off of the multitude of corpses you'll make.  But choosing what to kill with is not nearly as critical as how to kill.  Avoiding detection by soldiers standing next to alarm buttons, or surveillance cameras which pan the landscape, will save you grief in the long run; Project IGI spawns soldiers in various locations continually as long as the alarms continue to sound.  Don't let a camera see someone drop to the ground dead, either, or the enemy will be alerted to your presence.<br><p>More difficult mission layouts as the game progresses, combined with an AI that misses less in later missions, gives the game a reasonably good ramp-up of challenge.  On Easy (okay, I'm a big wuss, I'll admit it), some missions may demand several attempts, but never with such brutality as to seem impossible.  In addition, the enemy AI behaves smarter in the later missions; soldiers start hitting the deck when they come under fire, and then even fire at you from a prone position.<br><p>The game does have its shortcomings, however.  Most notable is the complete absence of a save game feature, although in similar games for console systems, saving your game is also impossible during a mission.  Still, considering that the competition is against the computer, and not a human opponent (there is no network option, either, sadly enough), having a save game option does not detract from the challenge the game presents.<br><p>Considering the lack of a save game option, when you're killed, you are forced to start the mission from the beginning.  Since the game revolves so much around having good intelligence - I mean knowing where your enemies are, stupid - repeat attempts are usually far easier than the original try.<br><p>Another problem is that Project IGI, though it's written under DirectX 7.0a, occasionally forgot to load all the textures for the mission.  If one mission was completed while this bug was occurring, the next mission generally got worse, until eventually you couldn't see where you were going (all the missing textures were replaced with an unshaded white).  Exiting the game and re-entering solved the problem, but considering the lack of a save game feature....<br><p>The game also was riddled with spelling errors.  Portions of the dialogue between Jones and Anya contained misspellings, the manual was rife with typos, and even one of the mission names was spelled incorrectly!  Quite a surprise that the QA people credited in the manual didn't catch any of these - or perhaps the release date was considered more important than waiting a day and fixing those embarrassing problems.<br><p>Finally - and I hate to give away the ending here - the closing cinematic sucked.  Perhaps it was a poor attempt at tying in a potential sequel, but you go through all these great rendered cutscenes expecting a tremendous ending, only to be thanked for your efforts at saving the world with a thirty-second AVI.  Certainly a let-down.  Along those same lines, the game and manual provided only a rudimentary plot, and the feeble attempts at character development were left completely unaddressed in the ending.<br><p>All in all, however, I did enjoy playing Project IGI: I'm Going In - quite a surprise, since I won it from <a href="http://www.avault.com/" target="_blank">Adrenaline Vault</a>, and the last thing I won from them was the ever-horrendous Men In Black.  Though I have doubts of the immediate replay value of Project IGI, I may go back and play it again a few months down the road.  I give this game (on a scale of five)&nbsp;<img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif">.</span>

It's in response to <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2001_0117.html" target="_blank">this post</a> that my friend at <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2001_0117.html" target="_blank">Fluggart</a> posted on his weblog, located <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2001_0117.html" target="_blank">here</a>, at <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2001_0117.html" target="_blank">Fluggart</a>.<br><p>I have fixed the problem with no home-going link on the archive pages.  What gives is that <a href="http://home.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">home.cwru.edu</a> doesn't support any sort of server-side scripting, and so, I can't add dynamic content to the page.  That means that all the content of the menu pane would have to go on my Blogger template and get published every time I post, not to mention that changing the menu pane would really, really suck.<br><p>Personally, I don't care enough to convince the SIS people to add a server-side scripting facility, but by all means, feel free to work on that on my behalf....</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Tactics, schmactics<br><p>I almost forgot to respond to the comments over on Fluggart about "real-time tactics" not being a valid genre...  Of course it is.  Not many games qualify for the genre - Myth and Myth 2 do - but the idea is that RTSes involve a higher level of management (on a strategic scale) whereas RTTs require only a local, tactical level of management.<br><p>The difference is primarily in the harvesting of resources and construction of facilities to produce units.<br><p>Other games that might prove a good example of the difference between tactical and strategic games:<br><p>Master of Orion.  Definitely a strategic game.  The actual tactical portion of the game is very weak (move your ships around on a grid - 8x8 or so?), but is primarily about gaining resources and constructing ships/developing technologies to operate a strategic plan.<br><p>X-Com.  Almost entirely tactical.  There are some non-tactical aspects to X-Com, but they're far, far outweighed by the lengthy turn-based battles involving moving individual people around and instructing them when to fire and what to fire at.<br><p>Starcraft.  It's been classed as a RTS, for good reason.  Managing a battle in Starcraft is possible, but is akin to herding cats.  Most games of Starcraft are won by superior resource management and initial build order.<br><p>Mechwarrior (any of them).  This game, while both real-time and tactical, is also first-person perspective.  It probably also gets classed as either a FPS or a sim.  However, it should be noted that the action contained therein is almost completely tactical - ordering your lancemates around and such - and completely lacks a strategic aspect (you don't even get to choose what missions to do).<br><p>Quake.  Well, this game lacks the strategic aspect, and comes very close to being devoid of any tactical aspect as well.  This is due primarily to the near-complete lack of penalty for getting killed.  As my roommate would say, this is a "twitch game".<br><p>Hence, MechCommander 2 being a RTT isn't just some marketing ploy - it's descriptive of what sort of game it is, and can be indicative of what sorts of gamers will enjoy it.</span>
