          <span class="blog-item">I killed dozens of enemy soldiers, and all I got was this lousy .avi<br><p>I just finished playing <a href="http://www.project-i-g-i.com/" target="_blank">Project IGI: I'm Going In</a>.  Yeah, yeah, really cheesy title.  It was developed by <a href="http://www.innerloop.com/" target="_blank">Innerloop</a>, a Norwegian game company, and published by <a href="http://www.eidosinteractive.com/" target="_blank">Eidos Interactive</a>, the Tomb Raider people.  Anyway, Project IGI puts you in the role of David Jones, a British-born secret field operative, who must track down both a stolen nuclear warhead and the Estonian mobster who supposedly swiped it.  What's more, the game puts in your hands a deadly arsenal - the details of which Innerloop researched, as the box says, with the help of ex-SAS soldiers.<br><p>That arsenal includes two semi-automatic pistols (Glock 17 and Desert Eagle) and a revolver (Colt Somethingorother .44 mag); two submachine guns (MP5-SD3 and the ever-popular UZI, of which you can brandish two simultaneously); three assault rifles (AK47, M16-A2, and SAW, though I never did find the SAW); two shotguns (Spas-12 and Jackhammer); and a sniper rifle (Dragunov).  In addition, you may find useful the LAW 80 shoulder-launched anti-tank rocket, and various explosive devices like hand grenades, flashbangs, and proximity bombs.  Combine those with the ridiculous amount of intelligence gained by using your variable-zoom binoculars (complete with friend-or-foe color-coded bounding boxes around enemies you can see) and your satellite surveillance, and one man has an almost unfair advantage over the hundreds of enemies you'll blow away playing this game.<br><p>Each of the 14 missions presented by this title starts with an introductory cutscene - fully rendered 3d, not a movie - that shows the tremendously well-designed landscape as you fly, drive, or run to some secluded enemy base, while Anya, your commander and intelligence officer, briefs you on the details of your mission.  Upon completion, your extraction from the mission area is sometimes depicted with another cutscene.<br><p>And the stuff in between is nothing to sneeze at, either.  The terrain is beautifully rendered, and comes into good use - you'll be trudging across a lot of those hills and valleys avoiding detection by enemy snipers situated in watch towers.  From the sky to the buildings, every texture is seamlessly integrated and provides an immersive game environment.  Well.... except for the trees, which look to be inspired by the simplistic tree design in <a href="http://www.everquest.com/" target="_blank">EverQuest</a>'s original installment.<br><p>Each of your weapons has its own specific uses, strengths, and weaknesses; the Dragunov would come in handy throughout the game, but it's not easy to acquire, and even then, you usually have trouble obtaining ammunition for it.  Such balances determine your weapon usage throughout the game, although you can almost depend on having a trusty AK47 available with virtually unlimited ammunition by picking them off of the multitude of corpses you'll make.  But choosing what to kill with is not nearly as critical as how to kill.  Avoiding detection by soldiers standing next to alarm buttons, or surveillance cameras which pan the landscape, will save you grief in the long run; Project IGI spawns soldiers in various locations continually as long as the alarms continue to sound.  Don't let a camera see someone drop to the ground dead, either, or the enemy will be alerted to your presence.<br><p>More difficult mission layouts as the game progresses, combined with an AI that misses less in later missions, gives the game a reasonably good ramp-up of challenge.  On Easy (okay, I'm a big wuss, I'll admit it), some missions may demand several attempts, but never with such brutality as to seem impossible.  In addition, the enemy AI behaves smarter in the later missions; soldiers start hitting the deck when they come under fire, and then even fire at you from a prone position.<br><p>The game does have its shortcomings, however.  Most notable is the complete absence of a save game feature, although in similar games for console systems, saving your game is also impossible during a mission.  Still, considering that the competition is against the computer, and not a human opponent (there is no network option, either, sadly enough), having a save game option does not detract from the challenge the game presents.<br><p>Considering the lack of a save game option, when you're killed, you are forced to start the mission from the beginning.  Since the game revolves so much around having good intelligence - I mean knowing where your enemies are, stupid - repeat attempts are usually far easier than the original try.<br><p>Another problem is that Project IGI, though it's written under DirectX 7.0a, occasionally forgot to load all the textures for the mission.  If one mission was completed while this bug was occurring, the next mission generally got worse, until eventually you couldn't see where you were going (all the missing textures were replaced with an unshaded white).  Exiting the game and re-entering solved the problem, but considering the lack of a save game feature....<br><p>The game also was riddled with spelling errors.  Portions of the dialogue between Jones and Anya contained misspellings, the manual was rife with typos, and even one of the mission names was spelled incorrectly!  Quite a surprise that the QA people credited in the manual didn't catch any of these - or perhaps the release date was considered more important than waiting a day and fixing those embarrassing problems.<br><p>Finally - and I hate to give away the ending here - the closing cinematic sucked.  Perhaps it was a poor attempt at tying in a potential sequel, but you go through all these great rendered cutscenes expecting a tremendous ending, only to be thanked for your efforts at saving the world with a thirty-second AVI.  Certainly a let-down.  Along those same lines, the game and manual provided only a rudimentary plot, and the feeble attempts at character development were left completely unaddressed in the ending.<br><p>All in all, however, I did enjoy playing Project IGI: I'm Going In - quite a surprise, since I won it from <a href="http://www.avault.com/" target="_blank">Adrenaline Vault</a>, and the last thing I won from them was the ever-horrendous Men In Black.  Though I have doubts of the immediate replay value of Project IGI, I may go back and play it again a few months down the road.  I give this game (on a scale of five)&nbsp;<img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif"><img src="images/turd.gif">.</span>
