          <span class="blog-item">Sweet dreams are made of this<br><p>So I just had this really screwy dream about an hour ago.  I've had dreams where in the dream I was asleep and dreaming before, but this was just really screwed up.  If I remember right, I had a total of four sub-dreams inside my regular dream - and it was really disconcerting when I finally woke up for real, because of the fact that I'd woken up four other times in the past few minutes.<br><p>Of course, the real time was the only time I woke up in my apartment.  The other times I was at various places <a href="http://www.state.wv.us/" target="_blank">back home</a>.  The only part I really remember correctly, I was with a friend of mine who was driving his <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/newcars/2001/volkswagen/newbeetle/gallery/42679.html" target="_blank">VW Beetle</a>.  We were on our way away from my house, and when we got to where one road turns out onto the main road, there was a lot of water backed up onto the road.  Well, he took a little too long to hit the brakes, and we skidded almost out into the intersection.  Then, I looked over to the left, and a semi-truck cab had skidded off the main road, and its trailer flew past the intersection on its own, causing a number of cars to swerve out of its way.<br><p>Then I woke up.  But it wasn't a *real* awakening, though I didn't know it at the time.  Anyway, I woke up at another friend's house, which was presumably where we were headed.  They told me that I'd fallen asleep in the car, and weren't able to wake me up, although they didn't explain how I got into the house or anything.  I went on to tell them about my dream about the semi, and of course they just made fun of me.<br><p>Well, I don't remember the other fake awakenings, or the dreams that went along with them, but it was by far the most bizarre dream I've had in recent weeks.  Perhaps not as screwed up as the electrocution dreams I had when I was about 5, but still really bizarre.</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Oh, I see, the Great Black Hope ain't good enough fo' ya<br><p>Well, I just finished reading the Florida Supreme Court's <a href="http://a311.g.akamai.net/f/311/2656/1h/www.flcourts.org/sct/sctdocs/ops/sc00-2346.pdf" target="_blank">opinion and ruling</a> on the election&nbsp;<img src="images/turd.gif">.  Strangely enough, I actually agree with it.  Well, most of it.  The first argument as to the conflicting "shall" and "may" parts of <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm" target="_blank">102.111 and 102.112</a>* really doesn't sit well with me, as I think 111 instructs the Elections Canvassing Committee and 112 instructs the several County Canvassing Boards.  But the rest of their arguments were sufficient to convince me that the "shall" and "may" language does indeed conflict.  (* - see Title IX)<br><p>As far as the remedy, it doesn't seem to me that they really did much of anything useful.  The <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/" target="_blank">Florida legislature</a> still gets stuck with fixing the broken statutes that were "discovered" by the court, and there's no guarantee that they'll get around to it during their next session.  And extending the deadline to next Sunday seems just as arbitrary as the November 14 deadline.<br><p>But in any event, I think the process can still proceed reasonably fairly even with the manual recounts proceeding.  In the event that Gore nets enough votes to overtake Bush, I see a pretty good foundation for contesting the certification of those results (which happens after the Secretary of State certifies the results).  What would happen after that is anyone's guess, but the contest would probably be in a double-pronged form:  one, an attack on the shenanigans going on in the recounts, and two, an attack on the failure to count numerous military ballots despite the Florida attorney general's declaration that they should be counted as valid with merely a signature and date.<br><p>One last item of note:  I mentioned yesterday the possibility of a statewide manual recount, and that I would consider it marginally more fair than the recounts occurring in only a few handpicked counties.  Interestingly enough, it appears that the Florida Supreme Court was practically begging to hand out that remedy - except nobody asked for it!  In fact, they mention that they questioned both the appellants and respondents on this idea, and neither side had any interest in going forward with that alternative.<br><p>Stupid move on Bush's part?  In one sense, perhaps.  But then again, some people may read into that (if it ever managed to hit major news outlets, which I have been avoiding today) the impression that perhaps Bush won't "stop at nothing" to win the Presidency.<br><p>Whatever.  Time for bed.  I'm exhausted from moving a friend's&nbsp;<img src="images/turd.gif">&nbsp;in subzero wind chills and then hoofing it home up an unshoveled sidewalk on a hill.  And yes, I do walk to <a href="http://www.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">school</a> uphill both ways.  Good luck, though, to the Cob, in getting to Jackson, Michigan, safely in this nasty <a href="http://www.weather.com/" target="_blank">weather</a>....</span>

          <span class="blog-item">The Great White Hope<br><p>So I was watching the <a href="http://www.flcourts.org/pubinfo/sct.html" target="_blank">Florida Supreme Court</a> hearing today (well.... Monday).  I'd further describe it by saying what it was about, but I honestly couldn't tell you anymore.  Everyone there wanted to make it a debate on whatever topic they felt would benefit their side the most.  The dems wanted to focus on the "rights of the voter", and the GOP people tried to reduce it to a question of whether the Secretary of State was acting within the law.  Refreshingly enough, the justices asked tough questions of both sides, and ended up focusing on preventing the "tragedy" from occuring of Florida failing to send electors to vote on December 18.<br><p>I watched the proceedings on <a href="http://www.courttv.com/" target="_blank">Court TV</a>, actually.  Yeah, yeah, <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">T</a>.  I know.  But anyway, Court TV didn't interrupt it with any commercials, and had minimal commentary during the ten minute recess the justices took halfway through the proceedings.  I suppose I could have gotten the same from C-SPAN, but I figured "Supreme Court" -&gt; Court TV.<br><p>Later this evening, though, I was watching <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/" target="_blank">Fox News Channel</a>.  Generally, I like Fox News above various other channels - sure beats the <a href="http://www.wkyc.com/" target="_blank">local</a>&nbsp;<img src="images/turd.gif" border=0>&nbsp;we're force-fed here in Cleveland.  But the commentary they provided on the court proceedings pretty much missed the point, as they tried to read far too much into the questions the justices were asking.  We'll find out their decision when they tell us, and any prognostication on the part of journalists is pure irresponsibility.<br><p>What do I hope will happen, though?  Honestly, I'd be satisfied with a court-ordered recount in the entire state.  But preferably, the <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm" target="_blank">rule of law</a> should be upheld, and the election results should be certified.<br><p>Of course, the best solution is to sink Florida into the Atlantic Ocean.  I mean, America's a girl.  What's she need with a wang, anyway?</span>
