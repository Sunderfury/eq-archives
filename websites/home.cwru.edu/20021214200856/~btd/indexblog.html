          <span class="blog-item">Page three<br><p>In case anyone is wondering, on Monday, August 19, I turned in a complete draft of my fecis.  This means that once Rrrrandy reviews it and hands it back, I can make some revisions, and continue <i>ad infinitum</i> until he's happy with it, at which point I can defend.  Starting to look like September is that time.<br><p>Anyway, over at Fluggart, T wrote <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2002_0821.html#1">an entry</a> regarding U.S. foreign policy.  At lunch today, I told him I disagreed with it, but couldn't remember why.<br><p>Now I remember why I couldn't remember.  Because, for the most part, I <i>did</i> agree with it.  The only comment I really want to make is that the U.S. is beginning to become enslaved to European foreign policy, which could be very dangerous for U.S. sovereignty.  It appears (to this rather uncultured American citizen) that other nations - especially European ones - contain a considerable amount of jealousy toward us (though doubtless it would not be described as jealousy in Europe).  Because of this, and because (as T mentioned <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2002_0820.html#1">earlier this week</a>) of the power which France holds in the UN Security Council (an unfortunate throwback to WW2 with which we will likely be cursed for decades to come), we must be exceptionally defensive when it comes to things like legal status of our soldiers, especially considering that our soldiers end up doing the bulk of peace enforcement around the world.<br></span>

          <span class="blog-item">Page two<br><p>So about a week ago, <a href="http://vorlon.cwru.edu/~beer/">my advisor</a> gave me an ultimatum of sorts.  Namely, I am supposed to have a semblance of a thesis draft by July 1.  Can I get it done?  Well, I think so.  At least, everything but Chapter 4.<br><p>Chapter 4...  ah yes, the big mistake of my thesis.  Essentially, chapter 4 is going in so that I can explain how not to evolve neural network controllers for a legged robot.  The thing is, I misplaced most of my data (but, fortunately, not the code) some long time ago, thinking that it was such a flop that I would never actually <i>use</i> it.  So, I'm re-running a bunch of my old runs, expecting them all still to suck.<br><p>Unfortunately, at least one of them looks pretty good....<br><p>In any case, I still have the introduction and conclusion, plus appendices and references to write up.  I think I can do that in a week, although I may leave the appendices and references un-tidy, and I'm refusing to merge the figures with the rest of the document until the material held within is finalized.  This is in protest to Microsoft Werd, which evidently knows exactly where I don't want my figures, and thinks it's funny to put them there.  I figure if I put them where I don't want them on my own, I take all the fun out of it.<br><p>On a happier July 1 note?  I will finally have the whole place to myself forever muahahahaha by then, and can start implementing my new matser plan for apartment domination.  Guess I should call the utilities at some point so I can enslave my wallet to them.<br></span>

          <span class="blog-item">And I still haven't found what I'm looking for<br><p>Well, with regards to my <a href="http://home.cwru.edu/~btd/archive/2002_06_09_archive.html#77703731">previous post</a>, ten days later, I still have not seen/heard about/tracked/<i>killed</i> Grizzleknot.  However, I have taken a rather interesting approach to finding him.<br><p>On a hunch, I have picked a spot which I think he may walk past shortly after he spawns.  On my crappy machine, I run EQ and put my shammy in the spot, and face him in a convenient direction for watching a nice open area.  Then, on my main machine, I run <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/">Neverwinter Nights</a>.<br><p>NWN is a pretty good game.  It doesn't live up to my (admittedly high) expectations of implementing the 3rd edition D&D rules, and there are some annoyances with regards to AI-controlled allies.<br><p>The 3rd edition rules are almost completely implemented, at least at first glance.  You have attacks of opportunity, critical hits, sneak attacks, and various other combat niceties.  However, they also take some liberties with the system - some of the special actions, like bull rush and grapple, aren't in there, which isn't that bad, but they replaced them with things like the "Knockdown" feat (yeah, it takes a feat to do that instead of just a str check) which they pretty much made up for the purposes of this game.  In other words, I wouldn't use NWN as a substitute for our tabletop RP sessions.<br><p>In terms of the single player campaign, it's interesting and pretty fun, and probably makes the game worth the money just for that (not counting the multiplayer stuff, I mean).  The one glaring problem, though, is the stupidity of the AI-controlled allies.  They are forever charging into combat - even when you tell them to stay put - making it difficult, if not impossible, to target AE spells without killing one or more of them.<br><p>A game which implements "real-time" combat already suffers from difficulties with your enemies moving before a spell is cast, causing you to miss most of them.  In 2nd edition pen and paper, you could have these sorts of problems caused by spell casting times; if you started casting a spell, but your targets all came up on the initiative order before you finished, they could be out of the area you targeted.  But 3rd edition changed all that - in the pen and paper version, you can cast a spell instantly, more or less, without interruption unless you are in a threatened area or an enemy has declared a ready action against your spellcasting.  In the real-time setup in NWN, though, your enemies get to run around a bunch while you cast, and if you don't "lead", you may miss them... though if you do lead, you may clobber your own party as well.<br><p>So far, the best thing I've found to do is lead my AI comrades away from the next door a bit, open it, cast a spell or two into the room to weaken up the baddies, and then pull as many as will follow back to my allies for final tenderization.  This works pretty well, as long as my allies aren't aware of the enemy - the moment they see enemies, though, they take off into combat leaving me pounding hotkeys for "follow me" and "stand your ground".<br><p>But aside from that, it's a pretty fun game.  Just nowhere near as good as Morrowind....<br></span>

          <span class="blog-item">Where is it!<br><p>So I'm an avid <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/">EverQuest</a> player.  Perhaps not as avid as some, but I'm entering a rite of passage of sorts - my first ridiculously long, painful, and very boring camp.<br><p>What's a camp, you might ask?  Well, in EQ, in order to improve your character's abilities, you kill stuff.  Lots of stuff.  An old character may have thousands of kills under his belt, some of which required the collaboration of dozens of players to achieve.  Anyway, there are two ways you improve through the killing of stuff:  experience (mad xps) and equipment (phat lewts).  But sometimes the lewts require the combination of various non-usable items which are "dropped" by various critters.  To limit the influx of lewts into the game, the designers thoughtfully limited the frequency with which critters appear.  Some of these are limited severely, with spawn times ranging all the way up to days and days.  The one I'm after - <a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=3672">Grizzleknot</a> - isn't nearly that bad.  From what I can tell, the spawn time is nonspecific, meaning you kill "placeholders" in the zone until it shows up.  That means there isn't a certain amount of time I have to wait, which has mixed effects - I may only have to wait a few minutes, if I'm really lucky, but I can't time my arrival based on the last time it appeared (which also means others can't as well, so the competition won't be as fierce).  Additionally, though, the spawn location is randomly selected from several places in the zone.  It's not a small zone, either.  I made a ranger on a second account with the tracking ability to assist in finding this guy.  Finally, once Grizzleknot spawns, he starts wandering around the zone.  All in all, these factors make this a difficult and really annoying thing to camp for, especially since I can't just sit in one place.<br><p>End result?  I've spent about 30 hours in the past week looking for him.  And I'm still looking.<br></span>

          <span class="blog-item">Glug glug cough cough cough glug glug<br><p>I've been victim, for the past nine days, to perhaps the oddest illness I've ever had.  It started off Sunday before last, with a slight scratchy throat in the morning and a bit of a hoarse voice.  Well, that sucks, I thought, but maybe it'll go away.<br><p>It didn't.<br><p>We played Advanced Civ that afternoon... and evening... and night... and well into the night... and the whole time, my voice steadily got worse and worse and worse.  On Monday, it was still bad, still with a slight sore throat, but we played D&D, and six more hours of me talking a lot while DMing meant my voice was really shot by the end of it.  Since then, I've had a runny nose, a sore throat, horrible voice, and a mucus-expelling cough which got really bad around Wednesday and stayed bad through Saturday.  Eventually, the mucus died down, but the cough stayed.  To make matters worse, I think for whatever reason I'm also salivating too much, and when I try to sleep I end up aspirating a bit of it, and then that wakes me up and I start coughing a bunch.  Sometimes it's about two minutes after I lie down, and sometimes I can get a couple hours in first.<br><p>I think I'm on the tail end of it now, though.  The coughing hasn't been nearly as bad - I seem to be coughing mainly only when I say something, as that irritates my vocal cords - and the sore throat is completely gone.  Hopefully it'll be gone all the way very very soon.  <br><p>I miss having a normal voice.  :(<br></span>

          <span class="blog-item">The Prodigal Weblog<br><p>So I haven't written to this weblog in a long time.  A really long time.  In fact, I look down at the previous entry and realize the time between that entry and this one was seven months.  Sorry 'bout that....  :)<br><p>Anyway, I'm thinking maybe I need to get back to weblogging a bit.  Why?  Well, it's a long story.  But I'll tell it.  In fact, this is one of those long stories - a convoluted, yet somehow chained, series of nearly unrelated events that when I tell my friends about my line of thought, they usually tell me to shut up.  Well, except for T at <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/">Fluggart</a>, who would just threaten to kill me again.  Funny that I'm somehow still alive....<br><p>So, the other day, I (for some random and unknown reason) checked the hit logs on home.cwru.edu, this site's esteemed provider.  They give info on various stats, but most interesting to me is url accesses.  Well, I keep my bookmarks on a web page on home (you can access it at the left if the menu pane is up), and I was almost surprised to see it had made the list as the second to last item.<br><p>Fast forward a few days - to this morning - and I decide to see if my bookmarks are listed on Google.  And indeed they are!  Wow, that's pretty amazing, I suppose.  I figure they actually got linked through Fluggart, much previously, but no matter.  Because of this, I wanted to see if I could come up with a Googlewhack for it :)  Anyway, the closest one on there is "steaming rantmonkey", but rantmonkey isn't a real word, so it doesn't technically count.  A close second-place loser is "steaming fluggart", which references my bookmarks, my weblog, and <a href="http://rejemy.dreamwing.com/">this weblog</a> maintained by an acquaintance.  (Strange that Fluggart wasn't listed there.  Oh yeah.  That's because he delinked me about a year and a half ago.  :P )<br><p>Well, that's what brings me to this point, the fact that after all this time, an acquaintance of mine still has my weblog on his links page.  And somehow I feel like I'm failing or something, by not writing for months on end.  So perhaps, if I write just a little each day, I'll be able to keep on this and have a (somewhat) amusing-to-read weblog.<br><p>Naaaah.<br><p></span>

          <span class="blog-item">You say you want a revolution<br><p>I picked up Civilization III on Friday night.  Yeah, yeah, like I don't already have a whole bunch of games, not to mention that I have lots of other things I should be doing.  Anyway, after a bit of fooling around, I've got some opinions to share on this one.<br><p>The original Civilization, a turn-based empire-management/world-conquest classic, was one of my all-time favorites from the days when I used a 386SX-16.  In all its 256-color VGA glory, it managed to provide a compelling challenge that, while being a little bit repetitive in some respects, had the right edge of difficulty to keep me playing "just one more turn".<br><p>Skip the network hack-job of Civ, skip Civ II, skip all that crap with Activision....  and enter Civilization III, several years later.  Obviously inspired by the original, definitely derivative of the original, but certainly no mere sequel.  Civ III has taken the features left out of earlier offerings and melded them beautifully with a well-written, well-designed, and well-crafted game, leaving almost no room for complaint or for improvement.<br><p>Most noteworthy are the artificial intelligence and the diplomacy system.  The AI is crafty and amusing, orders of magnitude better than the original Civ; the diplomacy system permits you to trade with your allies and bicker with your enemies using nearly every imaginable aspect of trade and diplomacy.  Also, the artwork is beautiful, and the in-game music is pleasant (and at times surprising), while not being repetitive enough to make me start to consider turning it off.<br><p>Still, Civ III does have its shortcomings.  First is the obvious lack of multiplayer support.  As easy as socket programming is, and considering that turn-based games don't have the concerns of synchrony that real-time games do, I don't understand why no multiplayer option was included.  There have been vague hints dropped that multiplayer will be added via patch, but such second-chance offerings have historically been poorly-executed.<br><p>Next off is the instruction manual.  Its fifteen chapters span 235 pages - yikes - yet the manual is only useful as a glance-through guide for obscure tidbits of info not presented in the online tutorial and Civilopedia help.  For example, the tech tree is not shown at all in the manual.  The player must use the Civilopedia to find that sort of info - and while the online help is... uh... helpful, it's frightening that 235 pages can be so devoid of useful reference information.  Additionally, the manual's index is pretty much worthless; I think I'm about 0-for-15 on successful index lookups.  On the plus side, the manual does give some information about certain things that are different between Civ III and its predecessors.<br><p>Another problem is the decision-making of your "advisors" - computer-controlled characters that both give you helpful info about the world and help you choose the next thing for your cities to build.  I found myself constantly changing the computer's choice about the next item to build, as it would nearly always choose a military unit even in times of longstanding peace.  Using the automatic "governor" options proved even worse; the governor system makes the choices for you, and despite the fact that I told it never to build military units, I was going back revising its automatic choices every turn, as it kept picking obsolete specialty units instead of useful city improvements.<br><p>Finally, there is an issue with the game speed.  While the amount of processing power required to process a turn's worth of computer player decisions is understandable, the lack of smoothness in scrolling, as well as the horrible rendering speed at higher resolutions (such as 1600x1200) was highly annoying.  Fortunately, the game plays well enough at the default 1280x1024.<br><p>All said, it's still well worth the money - not to mention the many, many hours that one will inevitably spend playing this game.  A definite four-and-a-half steaming turd.<br><p>On a side note....  I'm really glad that I wasn't losing my mind at Cindy's party Saturday night.  A person doesn't live in a place for 18 years and come away knowing nothing compared to someone who only has family there.  So let anyone who wondered know:  Tri-State Airport is in Huntington, and Yeager Airport is in Charleston.  Like I said.  :P</span>
