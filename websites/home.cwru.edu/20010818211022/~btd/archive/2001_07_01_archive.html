          <span class="blog-item">I wish the Internet could go back to how it was in the old days<br><p>So, the guys at Black Isle Studios made a downloadable expansion (<a href="http://home.cwru.edu/~btd/archive/2001_06_24_archive.html#4244409">as I have mentioned before</a>) that just came out a day or two ago.  Anyway, they're not happy to host their own files - though at 71 megs, I can understand why - but they decided to go through that demonspawn known as FilePlanet.  Essentially, FilePlanet is a way to drive people crazy who just want to download something, by making them log in, stare at ads, and hop on one arm while gargling peanut butter and saying "wooba wooba wooba".  What a waste of web.<br><p>Anyway, I'm 35th in line to start my download, and I'm writing this as I wait for it to finish, so's I can log out and install Powerpoint on this machine.<br><p>It looks like the whole D&D thing will actually happen!  I've ordered the rest of the 3rd edition books (though they haven't shipped yet, grr), and I've been cranking away on the first adventure.  We might even get the chance to play not too long after the DARPA meeting in Nashville.  But that'll be a quick one, perhaps just rolling up characters.  We're gonna stick with Tuesday and/or Thursday nights, as that's when most people can make it.<br><p>Oh, I'd like to mention, by the way, that the stupid window for FilePlanet popped up just as I was mashing the Enter key.  I have no idea what I selected, but now I'm 135th in line.  If this keeps up, I'm liable to kill Sean just to ease my frustrations....<br></span>
