          <span class="blog-item">Page two<br><p>So about a week ago, <a href="http://vorlon.cwru.edu/~beer/">my advisor</a> gave me an ultimatum of sorts.  Namely, I am supposed to have a semblance of a thesis draft by July 1.  Can I get it done?  Well, I think so.  At least, everything but Chapter 4.<br><p>Chapter 4...  ah yes, the big mistake of my thesis.  Essentially, chapter 4 is going in so that I can explain how not to evolve neural network controllers for a legged robot.  The thing is, I misplaced most of my data (but, fortunately, not the code) some long time ago, thinking that it was such a flop that I would never actually <i>use</i> it.  So, I'm re-running a bunch of my old runs, expecting them all still to suck.<br><p>Unfortunately, at least one of them looks pretty good....<br><p>In any case, I still have the introduction and conclusion, plus appendices and references to write up.  I think I can do that in a week, although I may leave the appendices and references un-tidy, and I'm refusing to merge the figures with the rest of the document until the material held within is finalized.  This is in protest to Microsoft Werd, which evidently knows exactly where I don't want my figures, and thinks it's funny to put them there.  I figure if I put them where I don't want them on my own, I take all the fun out of it.<br><p>On a happier July 1 note?  I will finally have the whole place to myself forever muahahahaha by then, and can start implementing my new matser plan for apartment domination.  Guess I should call the utilities at some point so I can enslave my wallet to them.<br></span>

          <span class="blog-item">And I still haven't found what I'm looking for<br><p>Well, with regards to my <a href="http://home.cwru.edu/~btd/archive/2002_06_09_archive.html#77703731">previous post</a>, ten days later, I still have not seen/heard about/tracked/<i>killed</i> Grizzleknot.  However, I have taken a rather interesting approach to finding him.<br><p>On a hunch, I have picked a spot which I think he may walk past shortly after he spawns.  On my crappy machine, I run EQ and put my shammy in the spot, and face him in a convenient direction for watching a nice open area.  Then, on my main machine, I run <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/">Neverwinter Nights</a>.<br><p>NWN is a pretty good game.  It doesn't live up to my (admittedly high) expectations of implementing the 3rd edition D&D rules, and there are some annoyances with regards to AI-controlled allies.<br><p>The 3rd edition rules are almost completely implemented, at least at first glance.  You have attacks of opportunity, critical hits, sneak attacks, and various other combat niceties.  However, they also take some liberties with the system - some of the special actions, like bull rush and grapple, aren't in there, which isn't that bad, but they replaced them with things like the "Knockdown" feat (yeah, it takes a feat to do that instead of just a str check) which they pretty much made up for the purposes of this game.  In other words, I wouldn't use NWN as a substitute for our tabletop RP sessions.<br><p>In terms of the single player campaign, it's interesting and pretty fun, and probably makes the game worth the money just for that (not counting the multiplayer stuff, I mean).  The one glaring problem, though, is the stupidity of the AI-controlled allies.  They are forever charging into combat - even when you tell them to stay put - making it difficult, if not impossible, to target AE spells without killing one or more of them.<br><p>A game which implements "real-time" combat already suffers from difficulties with your enemies moving before a spell is cast, causing you to miss most of them.  In 2nd edition pen and paper, you could have these sorts of problems caused by spell casting times; if you started casting a spell, but your targets all came up on the initiative order before you finished, they could be out of the area you targeted.  But 3rd edition changed all that - in the pen and paper version, you can cast a spell instantly, more or less, without interruption unless you are in a threatened area or an enemy has declared a ready action against your spellcasting.  In the real-time setup in NWN, though, your enemies get to run around a bunch while you cast, and if you don't "lead", you may miss them... though if you do lead, you may clobber your own party as well.<br><p>So far, the best thing I've found to do is lead my AI comrades away from the next door a bit, open it, cast a spell or two into the room to weaken up the baddies, and then pull as many as will follow back to my allies for final tenderization.  This works pretty well, as long as my allies aren't aware of the enemy - the moment they see enemies, though, they take off into combat leaving me pounding hotkeys for "follow me" and "stand your ground".<br><p>But aside from that, it's a pretty fun game.  Just nowhere near as good as Morrowind....<br></span>
