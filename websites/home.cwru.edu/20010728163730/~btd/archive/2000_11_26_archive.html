          <span class="blog-item">December... sweet, beautiful December<br><p>It's car buyin' time!  Sometime in the next couple of weeks, I plan to purchase a <a href="http://www.hyundaiusa.com/showroom/tiburon/color.html">Hyundai Tiburon</a>.  You might be curious about its <a href="http://www.hyundaiusa.com/showroom/tiburon/specs.html">specs</a>, I suppose.<br><p>Anyway, I've been looking into a car since about August.  And finally the time is - more or less - here.  So, I guess there are three things to do now:<OL><LI>Shop for insurance</LI><LI>Check on non-dealer financing</LI><LI>Go to a dealership and do the deed</LI></OL><br><p>This is the absolute first time I've done something like this.  I've tried to prepare myself adequately for the experience - <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/">Edmunds.com</a> is a good resource - and I think I can go in there and get a good price without getting jerked around too much in the process.  Hopefully, I'll have gas money left over after I make the payments, too....</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Morning alweady!  My, how time fwies<br><p>Ever since Thanksgiving weekend, I've been all screwed up sleep-wise.  Over the break, I was staying up until 4 am, 6 am, and eventually 8 am, doing such unfulfilling tasks as working on the web page and playing computer games.  Unfortunately, now I'm screwed.<br><p>For example, Tuesday I had a class at 10 am.  But I wasn't there.  Why?  Because I had taken a two-hour nap from midnight to 2 am, and then couldn't get back to sleep until about 7 am.  So, I decided to perpetuate the limit cycle by sleeping all morning and coming down to school in time for my 3:30 pm meeting.  Then, Tuesday night, I took another late evening nap, just in time to wake up and work on a project for Robotics.... until 6 am, at which point I played Diablo II for a couple of hours and then went to sleep.<br><p>Well, today is the day to alter the dynamical system.  I went to sleep at about 10 pm for about four hours, and then woke up, fiddling around on the computer until 7 am.  Woke up at 9 am and went to class, and now I feel like crap.  Hopefully, I can last until I get home this evening, so I can collapse and really screw up my sleep schedule.<br><p>Oh, well.  At least I'm going to class and stuff.  Used to be, that didn't matter so much....</span>

          <span class="blog-item">oom, medding<br><p>Due to homework, I probably won't get the chance to tinker with the page for a few days.  But when I do get to it, I'm planning to see if JavaScript-based client-side browser detection is the key to solving all of life's problems.<br><p>...Or maybe just the ones here.</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Bite me<br><p>You people using Internet Exploiter can just suffer.  I worked hard on these stylesheets to get them working in Buttscrape, and evidently that and getting it to work in IE are mutually exclusive events.</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Never mind<br><p>I figured out what I was doing wrong.  Still annoying, a few things that are verified implementation issues... mostly Netscape's problem.</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Kill me now<br><p>This whole stylesheet thing has got me down.  And I was looking so much forward to learning the things - and then it turns out they don't work like I thought they would.  Of course, that could be an implementation issue on Netscape's and Microsoft's part....</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Those were the good old days<br><p>I got bored tonight, and decided to log into my old, old stomping grounds:  <a href="http://www.bat.org/" target="_blank">BatMUD</a>.  I dunno, I played for an hour or so, mostly catching up on news gone by for the past year, but it wasn't really all that fun.  Not like it used to be.<br><p>Probably my experiences with <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/" target="_blank">EverQuest</a> and the Guide Program therein have sort of jaded me with respect to text-based MUDs.... not to mention that I'm a bit bored with EQ anyway, and have only logged in twice in the past couple months, only playing for maybe an hour once and five minutes the other time.<br><p>But it's like reliving part of one's past, logging in there, and here's the fingers to prove it.<br><p>The character I created this time was named "Dachannien" (not coincidentally, the same name as my Guide character on EQ and the name I go by on <a href="http://cwru.flangy.com/" target="_blank">CWRULog</a>).  So here's the finger to use as a baseline.<blockquote>Dachannien is a level 5 mortal of the Duck race.<br>It was created Sun Nov 26 07:00:48 2000 and it is 1h, 40min and 14s old.<br>It has been on for 1h, 43min and 6s, not idle.<br>It has killed: A newbie wizard, 356 exp</blockquote>My most recent character, "Kalay", I played for the bulk of my undergrad career (at least, until EQ came out).  In fact, you can see in that character's finger info that EQ was indeed the reason I haven't logged in there in ages.<blockquote>Kalay Alkayis is a level 32 mortal of the Cromagnon race.<br>He was created before 1997 and he is 55d, 10h, 49min and 43s old.<br>He was last on Sat May 22 01:03:46 1999 (554d, 8h, 43min and 34s ago) (Everquest!  Gaaaaaahhhh!).<br>He has killed: Baker's wife, 4819 exp<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kobold Chief, 627 exp (party of 2)</blockquote>That's right, I spent 55 days on this character between January 1995 and May 1999, although by May '99 I had already abandoned him for EQ.  That's okay, because I had between 20 and 30 days on my guide character, not counting the immense amount of time spent in weekly meetings and performing administrative tasks for my server.<br><p>Here's my first character, "Juareviano", whom I created when BatMUD was introduced to me waaay back at the beginning of freshman year, September 1994:<blockquote>Juareviano is a level 23 mortal of the Ent race.<br>He was created before 1997 and he is 1d, 13h, 13min and 8s old.<br>He was last on Sun Sep 18 12:17:28 1994 (2260d, 21h and 32min ago).</blockquote>Ah, memories.<br><p>And all that time out of my life wasted....  would I trade it in for better grades?  I doubt it.</span>
