<H1>Sorry.</H1><P>
<H3>You clicked on a taco.  I know that the burrito and the taco can easily be confused by
the novice, but for someone undertaking such an important task, you need to reinforce the
notion that the burrito and taco are actually quite dissimilar.  So, go back and try to click
on the burrito this time.</H3>
