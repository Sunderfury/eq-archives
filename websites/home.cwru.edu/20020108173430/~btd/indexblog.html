          <span class="blog-item">You say you want a revolution<br><p>I picked up Civilization III on Friday night.  Yeah, yeah, like I don't already have a whole bunch of games, not to mention that I have lots of other things I should be doing.  Anyway, after a bit of fooling around, I've got some opinions to share on this one.<br><p>The original Civilization, a turn-based empire-management/world-conquest classic, was one of my all-time favorites from the days when I used a 386SX-16.  In all its 256-color VGA glory, it managed to provide a compelling challenge that, while being a little bit repetitive in some respects, had the right edge of difficulty to keep me playing "just one more turn".<br><p>Skip the network hack-job of Civ, skip Civ II, skip all that crap with Activision....  and enter Civilization III, several years later.  Obviously inspired by the original, definitely derivative of the original, but certainly no mere sequel.  Civ III has taken the features left out of earlier offerings and melded them beautifully with a well-written, well-designed, and well-crafted game, leaving almost no room for complaint or for improvement.<br><p>Most noteworthy are the artificial intelligence and the diplomacy system.  The AI is crafty and amusing, orders of magnitude better than the original Civ; the diplomacy system permits you to trade with your allies and bicker with your enemies using nearly every imaginable aspect of trade and diplomacy.  Also, the artwork is beautiful, and the in-game music is pleasant (and at times surprising), while not being repetitive enough to make me start to consider turning it off.<br><p>Still, Civ III does have its shortcomings.  First is the obvious lack of multiplayer support.  As easy as socket programming is, and considering that turn-based games don't have the concerns of synchrony that real-time games do, I don't understand why no multiplayer option was included.  There have been vague hints dropped that multiplayer will be added via patch, but such second-chance offerings have historically been poorly-executed.<br><p>Next off is the instruction manual.  Its fifteen chapters span 235 pages - yikes - yet the manual is only useful as a glance-through guide for obscure tidbits of info not presented in the online tutorial and Civilopedia help.  For example, the tech tree is not shown at all in the manual.  The player must use the Civilopedia to find that sort of info - and while the online help is... uh... helpful, it's frightening that 235 pages can be so devoid of useful reference information.  Additionally, the manual's index is pretty much worthless; I think I'm about 0-for-15 on successful index lookups.  On the plus side, the manual does give some information about certain things that are different between Civ III and its predecessors.<br><p>Another problem is the decision-making of your "advisors" - computer-controlled characters that both give you helpful info about the world and help you choose the next thing for your cities to build.  I found myself constantly changing the computer's choice about the next item to build, as it would nearly always choose a military unit even in times of longstanding peace.  Using the automatic "governor" options proved even worse; the governor system makes the choices for you, and despite the fact that I told it never to build military units, I was going back revising its automatic choices every turn, as it kept picking obsolete specialty units instead of useful city improvements.<br><p>Finally, there is an issue with the game speed.  While the amount of processing power required to process a turn's worth of computer player decisions is understandable, the lack of smoothness in scrolling, as well as the horrible rendering speed at higher resolutions (such as 1600x1200) was highly annoying.  Fortunately, the game plays well enough at the default 1280x1024.<br><p>All said, it's still well worth the money - not to mention the many, many hours that one will inevitably spend playing this game.  A definite four-and-a-half steaming turd.<br><p>On a side note....  I'm really glad that I wasn't losing my mind at Cindy's party Saturday night.  A person doesn't live in a place for 18 years and come away knowing nothing compared to someone who only has family there.  So let anyone who wondered know:  Tri-State Airport is in Huntington, and Yeager Airport is in Charleston.  Like I said.  :P</span>

          <span class="blog-item">I wish the Internet could go back to how it was in the old days<br><p>So, the guys at Black Isle Studios made a downloadable expansion (<a href="http://home.cwru.edu/~btd/archive/2001_06_24_archive.html#4244409">as I have mentioned before</a>) that just came out a day or two ago.  Anyway, they're not happy to host their own files - though at 71 megs, I can understand why - but they decided to go through that demonspawn known as FilePlanet.  Essentially, FilePlanet is a way to drive people crazy who just want to download something, by making them log in, stare at ads, and hop on one arm while gargling peanut butter and saying "wooba wooba wooba".  What a waste of web.<br><p>Anyway, I'm 35th in line to start my download, and I'm writing this as I wait for it to finish, so's I can log out and install Powerpoint on this machine.<br><p>It looks like the whole D&D thing will actually happen!  I've ordered the rest of the 3rd edition books (though they haven't shipped yet, grr), and I've been cranking away on the first adventure.  We might even get the chance to play not too long after the DARPA meeting in Nashville.  But that'll be a quick one, perhaps just rolling up characters.  We're gonna stick with Tuesday and/or Thursday nights, as that's when most people can make it.<br><p>Oh, I'd like to mention, by the way, that the stupid window for FilePlanet popped up just as I was mashing the Enter key.  I have no idea what I selected, but now I'm 135th in line.  If this keeps up, I'm liable to kill Sean just to ease my frustrations....<br></span>

          <span class="blog-item">Morning wood in the late afternoon<br><p>Well, let's see.  It's Friday afternoon, I've gotten nearly nothing done today (as usual), and most of the weekend looks shot.  Well, it's not all entirely true.  I did get a bit written on my thesis, but not as much as I should.  I'm thinking about starting on Chapter 4 next, the one about the single-leg experiments.  Chapter 3 (everything you wanted to know about the robot but were too bored to ask) and Chapter 5 (this is what I've wasted the past two years doing) are almost done, sans figures, anyway.<br><p>If only I told my advisor that much.  He'd probably wonder why I was slacking so badly....<br><p>I have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786918365/002-8500479-9406445" target="_blank">Forgotten Realms sourcebook</a> on order (I mentioned it yesterday but didn't provide ph@t l1nk4g3 at the time d00d).  I should have it around the beginning of next week.  Anyway, I'm getting pretty excited by the idea of creating my own campaign, and I just have to convince people to play now.<br><p>Of course, this is assuming we make it back from Nashville alive.<br><p>We have to pay the travel costs up front for that trip and get reimbursed by the <a href="http://www.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">University</a>.  The plane ticket was some sweet deal on Southwest, $30 each way plus tax/fees.  But the registration for the shindig is $240!  It's okay, I suppose, in the long run because we're charging it all back to the DARPA account anyway.  On the plus side, the hotel rooms are already covered.  I'm not sure who I'm gonna end up rooming with, though - in any event, none of them are chicks, so I'm pretty apathetic all around.<br><p>So, Terence appears to be getting sick of me whining about the Internet not being the way I want it.  I run ad filtering software, and go to great lengths to filter spam out of my e-mail.  Also, I can't stand getting e-mail with HTML in it.  HTML is for the web.  I'm not "checking the web", I'm checking my e-mail.  No HTML, please.  And no Outlook, either.  I don't particularly feel like bending over and closing my eyes every time I check my e-mail.<br><p>Oh well, Terence never reads my weblog anyway, so it's not like he'll actually read this.  And if he does mention it, then I'll have him caught red-handed actually reading this drivel that I put up here.  I mean, really.  :)<br><p>A brief note:  I'm loathe to post ph@t l1nk4g3 to amazon.com, but upon this writing, the route to Wizards of the Coast was hosedz0r, so I had to settle for this.

          <span class="blog-item">Wonder if I can go a day this week without mentioning AD&D... oops, guess not today<br><p>I looked over the "open source" part of WotC's d20 system today.  Interesting stuff.  Certain things they tried to pin down with more specific rules, although the vanilla-presentation of the system in their <a href="http://www.wizards.com/D20/article.asp?x=srd" target="_blank">.rtf files</a> leaves you with the feeling that the d20 system is as cumbersome as Magic: The Gathering.  I don't think it's actually true; I'm guessing that when you put those rules in the context provided by the good ol' DMG and PH, the system will seem a lot more elegant.<br><p>Anyway, a couple of the changes are pretty interesting.  Armor class is switched around so that higher is better, for example, instead of the really good numbers being negative.  Evidently THAC0 got chucked out the window, too, but I'm not certain how the new to-hit rolls work yet.  Saving throws were completely revamped.  There are three categories of saves now.  You roll a d20, add your saving bonus to it, and hope it's higher than the target number you're given.  Or something.<br><p>Aside from that, I doubt that the rules will get in the way of good roleplaying.  They have an excellent (according to reviews) Forgotten Realms sourcebook, three hundred plus pages hardbound.  It's on order.  :)<br><p>Oh, and I've talked to five people so far about playing.  I've gotten a "pretty sure" from three, an "I'm not sure if I know how to roleplay" from one, and a probable "no" from the fifth.  I still have five more people I think might be interested, and I'm hoping to cap it off at four or five players.<br><p>Interestingly enough, two people so far have said they'd find it interesting to be able to actually *play* the game for once.  Every time they've played a roleplaying game in recent/distant history, they usually ended up GMing it, and they're interested in the opportunity to sit back, relax, and make somebody else kill off the party for once.  :)<br><p>Anyway, I have this pretty slick idea about an.... er... well, perhaps I shouldn't give it away.  In a couple of months, when we get started, I'll have to make some posts here telling about how the adventure is going....<br><p>Oh, one last note - I just got done watching John Carpenter's <I>The Thing</I> on Sci-Fi.  It's an entertaining movie, if just from the viewpoint of the puppeteered special effects and the sheer quantity of stuff that's on fire throughout.  The two bad things about watching it on Sci-Fi, though, are that they cut stuff out and they cut stuff out.  They censored some foul language - no big deal, I suppose - and scrapped one or two of the most gory instants.  What's more disturbing is the amount of stuff they cut for commercial time.  They ditched half of the computer simulation of the alien taking over a lifeform, they got rid of the last few blood tests (MacReady's version, anyway), and strangely enough, they didn't include the narrative voice-over at the very end of the movie.  Then they went and showed all the credits without squashing them, interrupting them, running them at warp speed, or talking over them.  Didn't make a whole lot of sense - spare the credits and spoil the movie.  :P</span>

          <span class="blog-item">I am in a stinking hot cave<br><p>It really is hot in here.  I have a 100-watt bulb in the ceiling, plus a computer, monitor, hub (which runs pretty warm, actually), and laptop in here, and it's always five to ten degrees hotter in my room than it is in the rest of the apartment.  We turned the air conditioning on this evening because we had guests over for milkshakes, but the comfort that briefly brought has since disappeared.<br><p>Before I continue, I'd like to make a brief addendum to my IWD review.  Several of the voice-cast members for IWD actually have significant credentials, including both live-action and animated movies and TV programs, not just video games.  By listing only three people, I didn't mean to exclude these other talented voices from my very positive appraisal.<br><p>Anyway, all this AD&D talk, along with my reading <I>The Hobbit</I> and the <I>Lord of the Rings</I> trilogy by the immortalized J.R.R. Tolkien, has got me back in the roleplaying mood.  I've already talked to a couple of people about possibly starting an AD&D campaign come this August or September (after robots have been built, research has been finished, and theses have been defended(!)).  I still need to read through some of the new 3rd Edition rules, though, before I commit to using them for the campaign.  Wizards of the Coast, who owns the AD&D franchise now, has come up with what they call the "d20" roleplaying game system.  It's crossed with the "open source" idea, and they're letting people use the d20 system in their own roleplaying universes.  I'm pretty neutral on that philosophy - I just hope d20 doesn't suck.<br><p>And, a closing good luck to Cindy, as she is taking ENGR 131 this summer.  Perhaps when she gets done, she can teach Sean everything she's learned about C++....  :)</span>
