          <span class="blog-item">I wish the Internet could go back to how it was in the old days<br><p>So, the guys at Black Isle Studios made a downloadable expansion (<a href="http://home.cwru.edu/~btd/archive/2001_06_24_archive.html#4244409">as I have mentioned before</a>) that just came out a day or two ago.  Anyway, they're not happy to host their own files - though at 71 megs, I can understand why - but they decided to go through that demonspawn known as FilePlanet.  Essentially, FilePlanet is a way to drive people crazy who just want to download something, by making them log in, stare at ads, and hop on one arm while gargling peanut butter and saying "wooba wooba wooba".  What a waste of web.<br><p>Anyway, I'm 35th in line to start my download, and I'm writing this as I wait for it to finish, so's I can log out and install Powerpoint on this machine.<br><p>It looks like the whole D&D thing will actually happen!  I've ordered the rest of the 3rd edition books (though they haven't shipped yet, grr), and I've been cranking away on the first adventure.  We might even get the chance to play not too long after the DARPA meeting in Nashville.  But that'll be a quick one, perhaps just rolling up characters.  We're gonna stick with Tuesday and/or Thursday nights, as that's when most people can make it.<br><p>Oh, I'd like to mention, by the way, that the stupid window for FilePlanet popped up just as I was mashing the Enter key.  I have no idea what I selected, but now I'm 135th in line.  If this keeps up, I'm liable to kill Sean just to ease my frustrations....<br></span>

          <span class="blog-item">Morning wood in the late afternoon<br><p>Well, let's see.  It's Friday afternoon, I've gotten nearly nothing done today (as usual), and most of the weekend looks shot.  Well, it's not all entirely true.  I did get a bit written on my thesis, but not as much as I should.  I'm thinking about starting on Chapter 4 next, the one about the single-leg experiments.  Chapter 3 (everything you wanted to know about the robot but were too bored to ask) and Chapter 5 (this is what I've wasted the past two years doing) are almost done, sans figures, anyway.<br><p>If only I told my advisor that much.  He'd probably wonder why I was slacking so badly....<br><p>I have the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786918365/002-8500479-9406445" target="_blank">Forgotten Realms sourcebook</a> on order (I mentioned it yesterday but didn't provide ph@t l1nk4g3 at the time d00d).  I should have it around the beginning of next week.  Anyway, I'm getting pretty excited by the idea of creating my own campaign, and I just have to convince people to play now.<br><p>Of course, this is assuming we make it back from Nashville alive.<br><p>We have to pay the travel costs up front for that trip and get reimbursed by the <a href="http://www.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">University</a>.  The plane ticket was some sweet deal on Southwest, $30 each way plus tax/fees.  But the registration for the shindig is $240!  It's okay, I suppose, in the long run because we're charging it all back to the DARPA account anyway.  On the plus side, the hotel rooms are already covered.  I'm not sure who I'm gonna end up rooming with, though - in any event, none of them are chicks, so I'm pretty apathetic all around.<br><p>So, Terence appears to be getting sick of me whining about the Internet not being the way I want it.  I run ad filtering software, and go to great lengths to filter spam out of my e-mail.  Also, I can't stand getting e-mail with HTML in it.  HTML is for the web.  I'm not "checking the web", I'm checking my e-mail.  No HTML, please.  And no Outlook, either.  I don't particularly feel like bending over and closing my eyes every time I check my e-mail.<br><p>Oh well, Terence never reads my weblog anyway, so it's not like he'll actually read this.  And if he does mention it, then I'll have him caught red-handed actually reading this drivel that I put up here.  I mean, really.  :)<br><p>A brief note:  I'm loathe to post ph@t l1nk4g3 to amazon.com, but upon this writing, the route to Wizards of the Coast was hosedz0r, so I had to settle for this.  Make sure to delete your cookies after visiting!  :)</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Wonder if I can go a day this week without mentioning AD&D... oops, guess not today<br><p>I looked over the "open source" part of WotC's d20 system today.  Interesting stuff.  Certain things they tried to pin down with more specific rules, although the vanilla-presentation of the system in their <a href="http://www.wizards.com/D20/article.asp?x=srd" target="_blank">.rtf files</a> leaves you with the feeling that the d20 system is as cumbersome as Magic: The Gathering.  I don't think it's actually true; I'm guessing that when you put those rules in the context provided by the good ol' DMG and PH, the system will seem a lot more elegant.<br><p>Anyway, a couple of the changes are pretty interesting.  Armor class is switched around so that higher is better, for example, instead of the really good numbers being negative.  Evidently THAC0 got chucked out the window, too, but I'm not certain how the new to-hit rolls work yet.  Saving throws were completely revamped.  There are three categories of saves now.  You roll a d20, add your saving bonus to it, and hope it's higher than the target number you're given.  Or something.<br><p>Aside from that, I doubt that the rules will get in the way of good roleplaying.  They have an excellent (according to reviews) Forgotten Realms sourcebook, three hundred plus pages hardbound.  It's on order.  :)<br><p>Oh, and I've talked to five people so far about playing.  I've gotten a "pretty sure" from three, an "I'm not sure if I know how to roleplay" from one, and a probable "no" from the fifth.  I still have five more people I think might be interested, and I'm hoping to cap it off at four or five players.<br><p>Interestingly enough, two people so far have said they'd find it interesting to be able to actually *play* the game for once.  Every time they've played a roleplaying game in recent/distant history, they usually ended up GMing it, and they're interested in the opportunity to sit back, relax, and make somebody else kill off the party for once.  :)<br><p>Anyway, I have this pretty slick idea about an.... er... well, perhaps I shouldn't give it away.  In a couple of months, when we get started, I'll have to make some posts here telling about how the adventure is going....<br><p>Oh, one last note - I just got done watching John Carpenter's <I>The Thing</I> on Sci-Fi.  It's an entertaining movie, if just from the viewpoint of the puppeteered special effects and the sheer quantity of stuff that's on fire throughout.  The two bad things about watching it on Sci-Fi, though, are that they cut stuff out and they cut stuff out.  They censored some foul language - no big deal, I suppose - and scrapped one or two of the most gory instants.  What's more disturbing is the amount of stuff they cut for commercial time.  They ditched half of the computer simulation of the alien taking over a lifeform, they got rid of the last few blood tests (MacReady's version, anyway), and strangely enough, they didn't include the narrative voice-over at the very end of the movie.  Then they went and showed all the credits without squashing them, interrupting them, running them at warp speed, or talking over them.  Didn't make a whole lot of sense - spare the credits and spoil the movie.  :P</span>

          <span class="blog-item">I am in a stinking hot cave<br><p>It really is hot in here.  I have a 100-watt bulb in the ceiling, plus a computer, monitor, hub (which runs pretty warm, actually), and laptop in here, and it's always five to ten degrees hotter in my room than it is in the rest of the apartment.  We turned the air conditioning on this evening because we had guests over for milkshakes, but the comfort that briefly brought has since disappeared.<br><p>Before I continue, I'd like to make a brief addendum to my IWD review.  Several of the voice-cast members for IWD actually have significant credentials, including both live-action and animated movies and TV programs, not just video games.  By listing only three people, I didn't mean to exclude these other talented voices from my very positive appraisal.<br><p>Anyway, all this AD&D talk, along with my reading <I>The Hobbit</I> and the <I>Lord of the Rings</I> trilogy by the immortalized J.R.R. Tolkien, has got me back in the roleplaying mood.  I've already talked to a couple of people about possibly starting an AD&D campaign come this August or September (after robots have been built, research has been finished, and theses have been defended(!)).  I still need to read through some of the new 3rd Edition rules, though, before I commit to using them for the campaign.  Wizards of the Coast, who owns the AD&D franchise now, has come up with what they call the "d20" roleplaying game system.  It's crossed with the "open source" idea, and they're letting people use the d20 system in their own roleplaying universes.  I'm pretty neutral on that philosophy - I just hope d20 doesn't suck.<br><p>And, a closing good luck to Cindy, as she is taking ENGR 131 this summer.  Perhaps when she gets done, she can teach Sean everything she's learned about C++....  :)</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Bring out your dead<br><p>As promised, here is a far-overdue review for Icewind Dale.  Coincidentally enough, I have also finished off playing Heart of Winter (the expansion), and while I have not thoroughly ownz0red this game yet, it's still pretty fun, even though I've seen the ending.<br><p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.interplay.com/icewind/" target="_blank">Icewind Dale</a>, designed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay, is an Advanced Dungeons and Dragons game, for the PC, based on (mostly) the Second Edition ruleset familiar to most people who have played AD&D at one point or another.  What's more, it's based on Bioware's Infinity Engine, which made its debut with Baldur's Gate.  But Icewind Dale differs from Bioware's offering in some ways, and harkens back to the old Forgotten Realms Gold Box games made by SSI back in the day.<br><p>One notable item is the party creation system.  Whereas Baldur's Gate allowed you to create one character, requiring you to pick up the rest of your party from certain NPCs offered to you by the game, Icewind Dale lets you create a full party, up to six characters.  All the basic classes are included (no kits, sorry), and multi- and dual-class characters are supported as well.  In fact, the only tedious part of character creation is stat generation.  You're forced to reroll stats and swap points around until you're happy with the results, but because the point swapping is cost-free (i.e., one-for-one), the system would be far less belabored by allowing you to specify a number of points to distribute amongst your stats.<br><p>The combat system is interesting as well, though it is the same as the Baldur's Gate hybrid turn-based real-time system (different from the turn-based with spell casting time system from the old Gold Box games).  The sedate gamer may be addled by the faster-paced action (there's no option to adjust the speed) at first, but once you become used to the situations when the pauses occur, the game mechanics become second nature, allowing you to get into the strategy of the game.<br><p>Perhaps the most amazing part of Icewind Dale is the music.  Composed by Jeremy Soule, noted for his work on some game whose title I can't remember, and whose music will be featured in Verant Interactive's release next year of Sovereign, the score in Icewind Dale and Heart of Winter is peaceful, dark, majestic, and foreboding, all at the right moments.  It certainly inspires visions of a band of adventurers traveling toward unknown danger through the frozen North.  Or perhaps I'm just in the process of reading Lord of the Rings at the moment....  :)  The voice talent roster had a few impressive names as well:  Mark Hamill (Star Wars, et al.) and Barry Dennen (The Dark Crystal, and not to be confused with the proprietor of this site!) did voices for Heart of Winter, and David Ogden Stiers (MASH) (!) provided his talents in Icewind Dale.<br><p>The scene graphics in Icewind Dale are without flaw, and every scene and dungeon brings a sense of depth and complexity.  The AI (which was substantially improved throughout the game in the Heart of Winter expansion) is more than passable, and I almost never found myself wanting to scream in frustration at my party members for their stupidity.  The plot is, while not incredibly intricate, still interesting, despite its rather bland linearity; nearly every dungeon must be explored to complete the game, although I would have done that anyway.<br><p>Still, the game had the occasional spelling error, as well as a few minor bugs; on rare occasions, my machine locked up while playing Icewind Dale, but as these moments were few, prodigious saving was sufficient to solve that problem.  Additionally, in some locales (most notably, Burial Isle), a combination of lots of monsters and lots of ambient sounds gave rise to a pretty severe frame rate problem on an Athlon 700MHz, 256MB, nVidia TNT2 Ultra, and SB Live X-Gamer.  The auto-pause function made this bearable, but it was still pretty annoying.  Also, Heart of Winter introduced a rather annoying pause (bug) that occurs anytime you manipulate things in your inventory.<br><p>There were two possible bugs - though I can't be certain whether this is intended or not - which made a larger impact upon the game.  One, when one of your characters is afflicted by a Flesh to Stone spell, not only is your character petrified for a round, but if not restored with Stone to Flesh that same round, they explode into chunks and are stricken dead (requiring a full Resurrect to bring back).  It seems to me that they should simply maintain their stone form until the effect is reversed.  And two, the random number generator seems highly non-random to me.  Perhaps this is in my head, however - I can't really prove this without a statistical analysis, and there is no easy way to extract the required data from the game.<br><p>Ultimately, however, the most glaring problem in the game was a design flaw.  Black Isle almost certainly planned to release expansions to Icewind Dale.  Unfortunately, they allowed the game to end after defeating the final enemy, dropping you back to the main menu after showing you the ending cinematic and credits.  The continuity into Heart of Winter from the original Icewind Dale was broken severely by this, as you really don't get an idea of the amount of good you do for the Dale by defeating your final enemy.  What's more, the designers wrote in a special NPC into the expansion, who appears in one of the original game's towns - he's there to take you into the expansion's lands, but once you leave, you can never go back.  You're left with the choice of re-importing your characters into Heart of Winter (causing you to lose any gems, potions, and scrolls collected in storage backs, as well as a huge portion of your amassed fortune of gold), or skipping the last portion of your battle in the original game, leaving the fate of the North hanging in the balance forever.  The design reason for doing this was to avoid writing new dialogue for the NPCs, but honestly, a little extra work goes a long, long way.<br><p>Aside from those few disheartening problems, Icewind Dale was a wonderful (-ly addicting) game.  Estimated time of addiction, 60-80 hours the first time through, significantly less on later plays.  The expansion was surprisingly short, which is probably what is prompting Black Isle to release a free downloadable expansion for Heart of Winter owners.  Still, it clocked in at a decent 20 hours.  Because of a number of added features included in the Heart of Winter expansion (hold down alt to put an outline around doors and chests, higher experience limit, auto-pause on enemy sighting), I strongly recommend to those who wish to play this game purchasing both boxes together and installing them at the same time.<br><p>By any means, it'll certainly pass the time until Neverwinter Nights comes out....  :)</span>
