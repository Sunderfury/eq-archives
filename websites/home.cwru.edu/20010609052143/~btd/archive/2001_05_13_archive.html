          <span class="blog-item">Whole lotta nuthin<br><p>That's pretty much what I've done this week.  Nothing.  Well, I take that back.  I've played a lot of Icewind Dale, and probably by this weekend I'll have finished it (and hence will be writing a review that nobody will read because nobody visits my weblog).<br><p>That reminds me.  <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">Terence</a> tells me that to get weblog hits you have to jump through a lot of hoops.  A whole lot.  He says he gets a bunch of hits, but it took him six months and a lot of commentary on other people's lame weblogs to get to that point.  What's the point?  I mean, when I wrote "Where's My Burrito?" I'd get perhaps one or two e-mails about it a week.  I even got links from various other sites that liked it.  But it didn't involve me writing up a bunch of blather about how much cooler I am than you because I have a real job working for a web design company or an ISP, which gives me the time to write up the aforementioned blather.  (I don't even have a real job.)<br><p>So, I'll be writhing in the Pit of Despair, watching my anime and playing my games, while <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/" target="_blank">other people</a> discuss Felicity and Friends and interior decorating and Julia Roberts being a great actress, and then wonder aloud why people confuse him for a gay guy.</span>
