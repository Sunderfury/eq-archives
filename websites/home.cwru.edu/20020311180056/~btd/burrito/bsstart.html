The great and powerful geek-hero gives you 35 cents, tells you to go buy yourself some
Wrigley's Spearmint Gum (if Wrigley's would care to send me a check for that overly
gratuitous promotion any time now....), and kicks you out on the street, saying, 
"Find my burrito, you fool!"
<P>
As you get up, halfheartedly dust yourself off, and make futile efforts to stop the bleeding
from the gaping wound in your now functionless knee, you realize that it would be best to start
with getting some background information on burritos and what they are.
<P>
First, maybe it would be best to find out if you know how to spell the word "burrito".
Click on the word "burrito" from the two choices below.
