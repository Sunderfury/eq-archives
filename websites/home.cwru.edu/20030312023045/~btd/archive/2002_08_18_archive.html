          <span class="blog-item">Page three<br><p>In case anyone is wondering, on Monday, August 19, I turned in a complete draft of my fecis.  This means that once Rrrrandy reviews it and hands it back, I can make some revisions, and continue <i>ad infinitum</i> until he's happy with it, at which point I can defend.  Starting to look like September is that time.<br><p>Anyway, over at Fluggart, T wrote <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2002_0821.html#1">an entry</a> regarding U.S. foreign policy.  At lunch today, I told him I disagreed with it, but couldn't remember why.<br><p>Now I remember why I couldn't remember.  Because, for the most part, I <i>did</i> agree with it.  The only comment I really want to make is that the U.S. is beginning to become enslaved to European foreign policy, which could be very dangerous for U.S. sovereignty.  It appears (to this rather uncultured American citizen) that other nations - especially European ones - contain a considerable amount of jealousy toward us (though doubtless it would not be described as jealousy in Europe).  Because of this, and because (as T mentioned <a href="http://fluggart.cwru.edu/blog/2002_0820.html#1">earlier this week</a>) of the power which France holds in the UN Security Council (an unfortunate throwback to WW2 with which we will likely be cursed for decades to come), we must be exceptionally defensive when it comes to things like legal status of our soldiers, especially considering that our soldiers end up doing the bulk of peace enforcement around the world.<br></span>
