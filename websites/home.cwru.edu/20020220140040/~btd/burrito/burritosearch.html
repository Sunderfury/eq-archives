<H1>Will you choose to begin the dangerous and somewhat addictive search 
for the evasive, enigmatic, and extremely tasty burrito?</H1>
<HR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
It all began when our illustrious geek-hero finally broke down and upgraded to Windows for
Workgroups.  Upon finally figuring out all the relatively obscure networking options, he spent
a good 45 minutes searching through the workgroups for .wav files to use for sound effects.
Among these, he located (on nearly every machine) collections of Simpsons' sounds.  One of the
sounds started a physically traumatic ordeal to occur in his head and stomach.<P>
And if you click <A HREF="burrito.au">here</A>, you can experience similar hemorrhaging and
gastric convulsions.<P>
As the seizing came to an end, the geek-hero had a horrifying revelation:  a question had been
posed for which he had absolutely no answer!  This fact, being entirely unacceptable, must be
rectified, he decided.  And so, being unwilling to devote his resources away from such pastimes
as Command and Conquer, Duke Nukem 3D, and a host of other IPX-network-playable games, he
decided to enlist the assistance of the entire electronic community, whatever the heck that is.
<P>
Of course, this was difficult to do with a 16-bit version of Windows, for totally
incomprehensible reasons, mostly having to do with the fact that Windows 3 through 3.11 were
written to run primarily on 386's.  Or at least it seems this way sometimes.  But anyway, the
geek-hero had revelation #2 ("Stubbornness never got me anywhere, and absolute Windows corrupts
absolutely") and upgraded his computer to a Macint...er, Windows 95.  This enabled him to run
shareware copies of web software which crashed frequently, requiring him to use Wordpad to edit
all of his .html files.  But at least the possibility of the search had become a reality.
<P>
You will not be the first to quest for the burrito, however.
One has gone before you....<BR><A HREF="bvsburr.au"><IMG SRC="bvs.gif" ALIGN=TOP>
