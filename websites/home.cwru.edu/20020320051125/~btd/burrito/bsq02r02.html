That was a picture of a taco.  Note the subtle differences:
<UL>
<LI>A taco has....
	<OL>
	<LI>A hard corn shell bent into a narrow U-shape.
	<LI>Large exposed internal surface.
	<LI>Visible vegetables.
	</OL>
<LI>A burrito has....
	<OL>
	<LI>A flour tortilla wrapped around itself.
	<LI>Almost no guts are shown.
	<LI>You can see a little meat, but not much veggie matter.
	</OL>
</UL>
So, I guess you should go back and try that one again.
