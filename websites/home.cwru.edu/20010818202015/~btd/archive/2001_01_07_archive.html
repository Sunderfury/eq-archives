          <span class="blog-item">Would you like to play a game<br><p>So my roommate and I are trying everything in our power to get a game together of Advanced Civilization.  Unfortunately, what with people backing out at the last second, and everyone's schedules being incompatible, it's starting to look a little shady.  Why, oh why, can't this just be easy!?</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Excavation<br><p>I asked my sister for the new U2 cd, "All That You Can't Leave Behind", for Christmas this year.  I'll write a full review of it eventually, once I look up a little more online info for this album, but I will mention that Bono and Friends managed to use the word "excavation" in one of their songs... several times, in fact.  <br><p>I'm not sure why, but I think Tenchi Muyo! is a pretty cool anime series.  I'd love to see the originals; evidently the ones on Cartoon Network are a censored version of a rehash of the original series plot.  Okay, I'm not so hard-up that I need to see animated nudity to satisfy myself, but as with anything, not having access to the original uncut version of something is disappointing.  Like watching Basic Instinct on TNT.<br><p>Speaking of which, here's an interesting conflict of standards.  On most network stations (with the notable exception of whatever channel it is that NYPD Blue is on), showing naughty bits is right out.  And even then, they try to keep it to late evening.  Even Comedy Central won't show a three-quarters butt shot until ten at night.  But the History Channel went ahead and put a movie about African tribal life on in the early day around the Christmas holiday, essentially meaning that kids could get all the breasts they wanted that day.  What is it that gives historically-based or documentaresque films a pass on this sort of thing, but when Strip Poker is on USA, they layer up in bras and panties because they aren't allowed to actually get to the skin underneath?<br><p>So I went ahead and purchased the Microsoft Optical trackball.  It's a pretty sweet device; it's more accurate and easier to use than the old trusty Logitech Trackman, and it's certainly more ergonomic.  Not to mention, it's a sweet black (or perhaps charcoal gray) plastic, and the aperture where the trackball fits is a nifty clear plastic, so the red LEDs light the thing up nicely in a dark room.  The one downside is that the dark plastic has a tendency to make my hand smell funny.<br><p>Of course, maybe the smell is actually a sign that I'm not resisting the urge to scratch certain places.<br><p>Ah, yes, and the spacebar has reverted to normal behavior.  It's possible that during my two-week leave, I forgot how to type, and was just missing the spacebar altogether.  I haven't had any trouble with it the past couple of days, and while I was away, I did virtually no typing, so it is a possibility.<br><p>This weekend, there are plans to play a massive game of Advanced Civilization.  If you've played this game, you know it can take a while to finish; our record so far is fourteen hours on a six-player game.  We want to get eight people this time, so that things are far more cramped and territory is at a premium, perhaps inciting the more destructive impulses.  In other words, we're tired of this wuss crap, and we want to see blood this time around....<br><p>There are some moments I really wish I had a digital camera.  I'll probably never get one, at least not without selling my film-using camera (and unfortunately, my "fence" lives in Portland, Oregon, right now).  But if I had one on my trip home, you'd see pictures here of the signs for towns in Ohio such as Hannibal, Torch, and Fly.  In fact, Torch and Fly were only a few miles apart, and I wondered if Torch named their city that to threaten the Fly residents.<br><p>But better yet is a particular power plant on the Ohio River where Ohio State Route 7 goes along.  Power plants - including coal-fired ones, like this one - need a lot of water to boil for turning turbines and such, so they need to be right on the river.  Well, for some reason, SR 7 needs to be right on the river, too.  Solution?  Build the power plant over SR 7, resulting in a big (maybe 2000 feet) tunnel with the power plant built right on top of it.<br><p>Oh, yeah....  I've started playing The Sims.  Kill me now, before it's too late.</span>
