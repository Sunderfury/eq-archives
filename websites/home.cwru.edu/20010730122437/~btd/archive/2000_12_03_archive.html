          <span class="blog-item">Financing my life away<br><p>So I used <a href="http://www.lendingtree.com/">LendingTree</a> to try to get a car loan... you know, like on the commercials.  I didn't have a bunch of people show up at my apartment or anything, engaging in single combat to determine who would have the honor of offering me a loan.  No, actually, my application was only referred to two lenders, instead of the four they imply will get a referral.  Then, one of them summarily executed my application.  The one remaining company, <a href="http://www.eloan.com/">E-Loan</a>, offered me a considerable amount less than what I requested... hence, <a href="http://home.cwru.edu/~btd/archive/2000_12_03_archive.html#1572416">Tuesday's post</a> which indicated my extreme sadness at being unable to afford the car I really want.<br><p>So, what is there to learn about LendingTree?  Well, for one, don't count on them if you's a po' boy.  They's the man, tryin' to keep me down.<br><p>And what about E-Loan?  Well, I called them yesterday, and asked if I could increase the limit they set for me.  They said no, primarily due to my level of income (fair enough).  Then, I asked if they could change the term to 48 months, and they said no again.  Essentially, that's a whopping crock.  But it really doesn't matter anymore - assuming there's no early repayment penalty clause in the loan contract, I'll sign for 60 months and make large payments.  On the bright side, I'll have the flexibility to pay the minimum payments when other expenses arise, and can pay the thing off in three to four years if I want.<br><p>In any event, I'm hoping to get around to some dealerships tomorrow, although it's snowing a lot today (stupid Lake Erie), and it may continue to be nasty tomorrow.  A Sam's run is scheduled for tomorrow, as well, so my roommate and I are already going to be on the road.<br><p>Unfortunately, our Battletech plans are going to be smaller-scale than I had hoped, but that probably is a good thing - we can try it out on this scope this time around, and if it goes really well, we can expand it significantly for the next campaign.  Fun fun fun....  :)</span>

          <span class="blog-item">Twenty-nine dollahs, or two fo fitty<br><p>So, as it turns out, the chances of me acquiring the financing for the Tiburon is close to nil, mainly because I make in a year just more than the amount I'm going to need to borrow.  When it comes right down to it, it's probably for the best.  I can easily afford a <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/newcars/2001/hyundai/accent/gshatchback.html">Hyundai Accent</a>, which comes with the same <a href="http://www.hyundaiusa.com/service/sewar.html">ridiculous warranty</a> that's on the Tib, fully equipped, i.e., CD player, power everything, etc.  I'll be far less stressed going into the process because of it.  I won't even have to do a 60-month loan.<br><p>The big minus?  It's far less swank than the Tib.  Far, far less swank.  I'm sad to let the thing go, but hopefully in a few years, when I'm making more money, they'll have the thing looking even swanker than it already does.<br><p>In other news, Birch and I are talking about starting a massively strategic Battletech campaign.  No small potatoes here.  We're not just talking, "get together on a weekend and blow some stuff up."  We're talking decision-making on a strategic level, distribution of forces on a world map, that sort of thing.  The game could take months or years, but I don't care.  So does war... except with the Israelis, I suppose.</span>

          <span class="blog-item">I... live... again<br><p>Well, I went ahead and inserted the JavaScript to select a stylesheet based on browser selection.  Currently, it differentiates between Netscape and Internet Explorer - I'm testing with Netscape 4.61 and IE 5.0.  So, if you're having trouble viewing the page, or it looks screwy, or all the blog fonts look suspiciously like Times New Roman (they're supposed to be Arial), let me know.  I'm adding my e-mail link to the menu frame.</span>
