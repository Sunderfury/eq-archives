Stories of adventure, special locations, key spawn spots or places to find unique weapons.  I've also talked to a few people about starting a weekly column focusing on opinions for what is current in EQ.  Of course we will continue to post bug information, petitions you have, ideas for game development, current in-testing results, in-game protests or anything else that you would like expressed to help get your opinions heard.  I encourage each person out there who is interested in contributing to the development of EQ, please send in the information that you may want to read, or that you feel other players may want to read.  I am more than willing to listen to your opinions as well, and if you don't have the time to put something together, maybe your idea can be expanded on by others with similar interests as your own.  I look forward to reading your information and I'm sure your fellow players will too.</blockquote><br>

                All I will really say is, I agree.  Other than that, you must be insane to even want to try.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Interesting but I'm not convinced the story is accurate. It might just be more juvenile fantasy. However, consider a full Guide (not an Apprentice Guide, they don't count) has the following capabilities and sometimes, like when they go LD and return with the GM flag gone (making them essentially a normal player - fun when the GM is a DE SK and goes LD while standing next to 4 Freeport guards) they actually use these capabilities.<br><br>1) 60 seconds of  100% invulnerability, instantly recastable (cast time is measured in milliseconds - grin)<br>2) /zone to any zone or the 0,0,0 "safe point" of the current zone<br>3) High-rate HP regeneration, almost enough to take a good long swim through lava and come out not much worse for wear.<br><br>Although the Guide/GM could /summon the player(s) in question thereby stopping their attacks (!) it is a violation of P&P to summon a player outside of very specific circumstances. Guides are admonished to DIE before counter-attacking a player or NPC. Some corrupt (yes, I used that word intentionally) Guides violate the P&P in many ways, as the recent banning of a Guide demonstrated.<br><br>Also, a Guide has way more HPs than Ice Comet has damage, and thats not taking into account the fact Ice Comet would resist almost 100% on a level 50 Guide with sky-high MR (aka Avatar buffing).<br><br>And remember, the real (Verant) GMs are totally different beasts. They can /kill a player, /kick a player, /freeze a player, /silence a player, and do just about anything they want to do. Good thing for the little dreamers the real GMs are not PK. That would be a nightmare.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                <br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><blockquote>
                This is a situation that occured to one player which envolves a bug, and lack of attention towards his problem.  I must admit, I was laughing a little bit while reading the letter, but the point that needs to be made is if he was able to prove this problem to be real, a compensation COULD have been made for his time in dealing with the problem.  Take a look, and share your thoughts.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Hello, <br><br>I have recently experienced a huge bug with my account, and I wish to share how Verant decided to handle it. <br><br>THE BUG: <br>Simply put; if anything that conned Amible or better saw me fighting, they would immeadiately consider me a threat and attack me.  This meant I got killed by many guards while fighting Newbie MOBs... I got killed by Altunic Jartin for attacking Narls... I got killed by a swarm of Halflings for killing Nillipus... I think you get the picture... <br><br>THE PROBLEM: <br>Well, no GM would believe me, especially when I said that it started happening with ALL of my characters on the Bertoxx server so I decided to take action for myself and demonstrate the NPC murdering me in front of as many people as I possibly could, dying hundreds of times and getting many people on the server to petition for me.  Well, after 2 monthes of that and several losses, a GM finally gave me a chance to prove my bug to him.  What do you know, I prove it whith 3 different characters in 3 zones a piece!  He said to go hide out in Nek or Guk where everything hates me anyway until the nest patch and the problem should be solved. <br><br>THE AFTERMATH: <br>The patch came out and everything APPEARED to be fixed, but yyou know, I still felt a little slighted.  I had to do all of that just to get the GMs attention, and now my gameplay was far behind where it should have been by then.  I mean a friend of mine that is 12 levels higher than he was when my bug started, and he is the one I usually would have hunted with if I wasn't dying so often.  But the salt in the wound was when he told me, "Sorry you weren't with us today, we got a warrior only weapon while in PoF that we had to toss because there weren't any warriors in the zone." So, immeadiately after that I petitioned to Tinysa herself, when she wasn't availible I logged and sent her an email.  She then had an Online discussion with me the next day to the effect of "I want to help you, but I am not allowed to help." <br><br>30 SECONDS LATER: <br>I was so upset that I just started murdering orcs in Lesser Faydark when one got away and what do you know, about 10 PO'ed NPC rangers come after me... NPC Rangers that I usually con "Kindly" with... After recoving my body I went over to the camp, and sure enough, they still conned "kindly".  So now I am screwed and my bug still isn't fixed! <br><br>MY THOUGHTS: <br>First of all, I think that a GMs should be able to rectify any damage done to someone by a bug in their game.  After all, if they are going to keep complete control and not allow any exploitation or cheating (Not my cup of tea, but to each their own), they should make it so that the game is bearable after a bug has affected you.  I am now back to killing Ancilles in Mistmoore, one of the most boring camps I have made, but now I have to make it twice and not with the friends I have made and prefer to hunt with. <br><br>Please, if you agree, send emails to me (otaku777@hotmail.com) and I will compile them and send them en masse to Verant employees.  I hope that this gets posted for not only for the world to see but those Verant employees as well... </blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

The first thing you do is find a fresh corpse. Next thing you do is do a who to find if the corpse's owner is still on. If he is still on message him saying that you want to test a "distantance consider" on him. Then tell him he con's red to you. Then ask him to do a distant consider on you. He'll ask you "how do I do a distant consider?" Tell him to type in /cons yourname. When he types this in you will be give full permision to loot his corpse, containers and all. Even if he rejects permission once you are in the corpse you are still free to loot everything on it. Once this is done LOG. And stay logged for a long, long time. GMs take quick action on people who do this with banning and suspension. If a GM confronts you about it, plead ignorance and that you never talked to the person you looted. GMs can't do anything if it's your word against his. Have fun with it!</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

If are KOS to a group, i.e. FP Militia,  invisi, and go into a quiet area of town with a Militia Guard.  stand beside him, make sure you have the items you want duped on you and a hot key with /consent <name>( of your friend) set up, once done, log out.<br><br>This next part takes quick timing, you only have about 3 seconds to<br>complete it. Now wait a few minutes for the server to save a few times.  then log back in.  make sure your friend is there to greet you.  DO NOTHING. to make your character move. DO NOT have your friend talk to you. Basically nothing to get the guards attention on you till the system cycles his radius of interest and attention. open your inventory and drop something on the ground you want duped. hit your consent hot key.  if your quick, you will get both done before the guard introduces your face to the cobblestone.<br><br>Notice through all of this, not once did your message window say you've been saved.<br><br>While returning to bind point drop connection to the game.  wait 5 min. and log back in.  if all worked out properly,  your friend has /corpsed your body to your safe bind point. You will find the item you dropped has been duped (Your friend should have this on him) as well, you stand a good chance at coming back to the bind point unconscious.  if you did,  your still fully equipped and so is your corpse.<br><br>I have tried this once. and due to the Gestapo/Big Brother tactics Verant seems to think we are paying them for, I will not repeat to confirm.<br><br>Probably, some of the steps listed above may not be needed, but as I have only performed this once. I cannot say what steps can be eliminated.<br><br>This is an alteration on the Duel, drop cash and zone bug from a few months back without advertising across the server what your doing.<br><br>And Finally,  if you want to induce your on Packet loss and lag for yourself,   before you start EQ,  start a nice long download, open ICQ and start transferring a LONG file to a friend.

Otherwise, the following letter is getting a lot of support and press.  Take a look and share your opinions.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">I would like to provide the community with information so they can understand the nature of Verant's changes to FD. The changes are significant, a nerf, and their news message was misleading.<br><br>"If you were within sight, they would immediately come after you." - No, they came back based on aggro radius. If you saw them wander away to a safe distance, you could get up without training anyone.<br><br>"If not, they would come after you at some later point. This might happen within a few minutes, or could happen even a few hours later" This was not random, but the result of game mechanics understood by experienced feigners. A feigned upon mob has you in its aggro list. If someone else re-aggros the mob to a lesser degree than the original feigner, it will return to the feigner. Feigners knew this! If the mobs were in front of them in a room, they knew no one would disturb them and all was fine. If the mobs were scattered around the dungeon by a train wandering home, they knew to zone.<br><br>".... Four times means about 20 percent ...." - These numbers seem totally inaccurate. I had to feign 11 times on a green guard and 10 times on a knight while testing in Freeport. If ANY of your feign attempts fails (xxxx has fallen to the ground) then the mob comes running back. NO OTHER SKILL takes 4 or more successful skill checks in a row to perform a single act. If you have multiple mobs, it is almost impossible to fool them all. If even one is not fooled, it will build a train as it runs to you - quite possibly from so far out of sight that you don't even know you are killing other players.<br><br>Feign used to be predictable. If you were successful against a mob that can be fooled (some couldn't be - this was a matter of experience and feigners knew which mobs to avoid), it would never come back unless re-aggroed by another player. Verant implies otherwise, but it is NOW that the skill is totally unpredictable, with mobs that are far out of sight deep in the dungeon randomly returning, based on percentages apparently much worse than those Verant gave and which are useless against multiple mobs. Stand up, and a feigner doesn't know if he is killing people far out of sight, or has safely cleared aggro.<br><br>Before a player had to re-aggro a mob in such a way that the feigner was still higher on its aggro list (such as by coming very close, but doing no damage), and in this case it was usually only the feigner that was in danger. Now every time a feigner stands up mobs can come training from everywhere, and if he feigns again because he sees them coming, they will attack anyone nearby or in their path home.<br><br>Feign pulling is still possible, although harder. Feign twinking/leveling others is still possible, and should actually be easier. Feigning to avoid death or trains now results in far more trains. What are these "evolving gameplay issues" that Verant hoped to address? In what way was this supposed to make this a better game?<br><br>I ask that the EQ community understand this is not just a nerf to SKs, Necromancers, and Monks, but to anyone that has ever grouped with them or even played in a dungeon, and invite you to provide /feedback in game to voice your opinion.<br><br>Thank you for listening,<br>Yeti (Level 50 monk, Karana server)</blockquote></font><br></blockquote><br>

If someone dies just as they zone, there is a chance that he will be duplicated; he will appear alive, but hurting, in the new zone but his corpse will be found in the old zone ready to be looted.  And yes, all of the items will be duplicated too.  This bug is hard to produce and may be harmful to your health.<br><br>5.

                Let me start off by saying I apologize for the state that I have let the site get into recently.  Please, don't get me wrong here, I do not feel that it was the doing of any of the reporters.  Each one of the staff members contributed a great deal of time and energy to developing daily news content for you to read.  I appreciate everything they offered and will continue to stay in touch with each one of them.<br><br>Although I admit, it is ultimately my responsibility to make things operate smoothly and continually strive to bring fresh new information to the players.  This I have failed and I am sorry.<br><br>I have been able to use the excuse for some time that I do not play EQ and that is the reason for not being active around the site.  This should not be an excuse and will hopefully be put aside in the future.  I did log into EQ just the other night, created a character, and was amazed at some of the changes that I experienced.  Some of the issues that I have problems with are still there, but for the most part, I saw some great development over the course of the past year.<br><br>With all of this said and done, let me give you some thoughts for the future of this site.<br><br>Most of you understand the philosophy of my network.  Most of you get the concepts, and understand the ideas behind what I am trying to do.  Granted, this is an extremely fine line that I have often crossed back and forth over, however I do feel that I have traveled this line pretty well.  If you don't understand what this site is about, that is ok, I encourage you to visit more often, and open up your mind to new ideas, ask around, and you should figure it out.  What I want to try and avoid from now on is crossing that line with the public.  We are here for you, and we want to make sure that you benefit the most from what our news promotes.<br><br>We will continue to post bugs, problems, complaints, or issues that arise within the game. Our main goal is to get the bugs fixed, and the problems resolved.  This is all focused around supporting Verant with information so that they may present us with a better all around game.  <br><br>I would request a few things in the process.  First, if you send me information to post, I would also encourage that you attach a copy to Verant.  Second, the information that is posted is for public knowledge, to help Verant track down and fix problems, and to improve game play.  Be warned, if you use any of the bugs or exploits to your benefit, we are not held responsible for your actions and you will most likely get banned.  For those who are unaware of the tracking system in EQ, they can track ANYTHING you do.  They can tell how many people took 10 steps to the North, turned east, and jumped.  There is no way to hide from most bugs or exploits, so if you are attempting to screw the game, the game will have the last laugh.  We are not about screwing over the game, we are about improving the game and making it more enjoyable.<br><br>In the near future you will begin to see key members of Verant's development team communicating with the players and this site through our message forum and main news page.  If there are issues that you would like addressed, please post your concerns or email them to me.<br><br>In the next few weeks, we will be establishing a development team chat with focus on bugs and current items that are in testing.  This will be the first chat of its kind and Verant has agreed to work out arrangements to support this type of player communication on a regular basis if the first chat is successful.  This active approach by Verant is the first true attempt by any company to work directly with the players to actively improve their game.<br><br>There will obviously still be a struggle with looking at all of the information that you send me.  I have access to EQ, but do not play it as often as I should for someone who has a site dedicated to the game.  I will attempt to resolve this issue over the course of the next few days.  At this time, I do not want to bring on any additional help, however I will not rule it out in the future.  Please begin to send all EQ related information to <a href="mailto:eqnews@drtwister.com">eqnews@drtwister.com</a> - or email me personally at <a href="mailto:drtwister@drtwister.com">drtwister@drtwister.com</a><br><br>Thank you all for your support, patience and understanding.<br><br>Dr.TwisTer<br></blockquote><br>

Due to The inkies small stature it may work better. But to explain how I found this. I was in najena and fell in one of those pits(the one without the hole in the side) and thought great now what (me a wood elf druid) I could gate out or wait for my group to get there and try and get a key. well I decided to wait, while I was waiting I was running and the bars and "sliding" back and forth(just running left and right into the bars) pushing against the bars, I started to push my way through the bars and ended up on the other side. I checked this with a half-elf and a dwarf along with a human, it happens to all of them, have yet to test the larger races. it works with alot of gates and you can also get inside some other structures doing this (I have managed to be right in the middle of a stone pillar at the Butcherblock druid ring).<br><br></font></blockquote><br>

                Well lets bring back up the subject of being "Under the World". There are several locations that this can happen at and we have posted them, but there are several others out there. Here is a repost of the first one I posted to remind everyone. When going into East Commons from West, make sure you're on the left wall at the VERY top as far as you can go and zone into East Commons, keep angled upwards and just walk straight very soon you should be falling over the mountain, receive the Player Under the World message and be teleported almost to the Zone point between East Commons and Freeport.  Cheap easy ride!<br><br>Now then, we all know why Dark Elves really have that dark skin... Its pure oil! Yes thats right you heard me, all those looking for oil for their blades go off and kill all the Dark Elves you can! And do you want to know how I know their covered in oil? Well a bug was sent to me, and I know it has been posted several other places, but for those who play Tier'dal and don't know it, you're missing out on never having to open another large gate again. Just walk up to one of the gates and keep walking, you'll slowly seep oil out of your skin, lubricating the bars and you will slowly "squeeeeeeze" through the openings. I've tried it out it works great, all of the Gates in Neriak that are bars works this way. That also explains why so many Dark Elves get away from me, their slippery sons.<br><br>Please send forth those bugs, and any "Under the World" spots, simply to recap and possibly add in more for our recent additions to the readers base, to keep them up to speed.</blockquote><br>

                Well everybody, the time has now come for me to resign from my position as a staff member of this site.  This is not done in bitterness, hate, or sorrow, however, so don't think that for a second.  Also, don't think that I am quitting from the EQ Alert because I was banned from EverQuest for working on this site(some of you who don't regularly read the message board probably didn't know that...), because that's not it, either.<br><br>The reasons for my leaving vary, but the biggest reason is that I am branching off to start a site of my own, along with a friend of mine.  The basic philosiphy of the site will be the same as the DTN's(Freedom of information in gaming), but we will most likely cover a much broader base than any other one site on the network.  Our plans are not fully realized as of yet, nor is the coding even started, but a rough estimate would be to expect us to be up and running by new years day, 2000.  Don't quote me on that date, please.  I have talked this over with the big man, Dr. TwisTer, himself, and we hope to remain very close to each other, perhaps even sharing information on a somewhat broad scale, other than just keeping in touch with the updaters, which I know I'll be doing.<br><br>So, as of later today, there is no Baggle at DTN.  That sound kind of funny to me, since I consider this network my home, and have pride in it, but I know that what I'll be doing will really make me happy, and more satisfied with what I'm doing with my free time and creative energy.  I thank you all for the support I have received, and I want you to know that it's been a great time working here the past four months, but now it is time for me to move on.  See you in a month or two, guys.  Thanks for everything.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Deciding that unfortunately we are lacking in news, it appears Baggle has disappeared as well as Stormlord. So now we bring about a new idea, I hear rumors, alot of them. However never anything substantial. I know Dr. TwisTer himself used to run a column much similar to this on UO Alert, this is simply to keep everyone on their toes and watch for bugs.<br><br>1) Memory editing is still working, including Size tweaking has been possible. We're talking Halfling sized Ogres and Ogre sized Halflings.<br><br>2) Dupe bugs are still all over the place, most of which still abuse lag time and heavily populated areas.<br><br>3) Several quests still give outrageous amounts of money for a little work.<br><br>4) Bugging your character so you can loot anyone's corpse, without consent.<br><br>5) PVP Server looting ALL items from others still works, did you right click on the item or try dropping the items on your character picture?<br><br>6) Several Emulators are being worked on, two of which are lacking only AI scripting and being worked on. I have no direct proof of this, again these are just rumors.<br><br>So, I'm telling you all these things are still happening and out there, but I have no proof of how to reproduce them, please don't send me emails asking how to do anything.<br><br>If you have any bugs/tips/information email me with it, lets keep this place alive.</blockquote><br>

                <br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><blockquote>
                I've been thinking about doing this for a while, and today I finally put in the five minutes of work needed to do this.  I created the Dr.TwisTer Network SETI@Home team!<br><br>For those of you who aren't familiar with SETI@home, let me bring you up to speed.  First of all, you are probably saying, "SETI?  Isn't that Search For Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence?"  Well, yes.  It is.  SETI is a semi-government funded program(if you can consider $100,000 a year funding)that collects radio waves from space on huge radio-telescopes.  The data is then processed, and the computer determines if the radio wave could possibly be from an intelligent life form from anywhere in the galaxy.  <br><br>As you might have guessed by now, deciphering all of this data takes an <I>immense</I> amount of time, and that's where SETI@home comes in.  SETI@home is a small download(700k), that, when run, connects to the SETI@home server, collects a 340k clump of raw data, called a work unit, and uses your computer(and millions of other people's computers) to decipher the data.  After you decipher it, your computer connects to the SETI@home main server, gives it your data, and gets a new work unit.  <br><br>SETI@home functions mainly as a screensaver and just something to do while your computer is doing nothing, but it adds a level of competition.  There are many different teams, in several different categories(small business, club, large business, gov. agency, school, university, etc) competing to be number one.  Places are determined by the total sum of the CPU time of the group(what it goes by on the site for #1), and total work units processed(so you can brag to your friends about how fast your computer is, and then they can make fun of you for being such a geek).  <br><br>Now that you're up to speed, go download SETI@home for <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/windows.html">Windows 9x/NT</a> or the <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/unix.html">text based version</a> for Linux, Unix, MacOS, BeOS, and many others.  <br><br>After you have SETI@home, you will need to join the Dr.TwisTer Network SETI@Home team.  To join, follow <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cgi?cmd=team_join_form&id=45541">this link</a>.  It will ask you for a password, which you won't have, so just click on the "Don't have a password?" link and they will send one to the email address you used to make your account with.<br><br>You can also visit the SETI@home mainpage at <a href="http://www.setiathome.com">http://www.setiathome.com</a><br><br>-Baggle<br>PS - if you look up my personal stats, please don't think I am a slacker:)  I really did have more work units done, then my email address was gone, so I had to make a new SETI@home account.  Doh!</blockquote><br>

                Another EverQuest information site is to be opened soon.  "Big deal" you say?  Well, this site is going to be different.  For starters, it has the official "Baggle says we're a cool EverQuest information site" approval,  along with <I>very</I> few other sites outside of the network(namely <a href="http://www.everlore.com">EverLore</a> and <a href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/">AllaKhazam's Magical Realm</a>), but other than that, this site is a specialty site.  EverQuest Maps is going to be a site specializing in, you guessed it, maps for EverQuest!  This site won't just include a map for each zone, however, it will include much more.  Every item that can be obtained in the zone will be listed along with a location of it, landmarks in the zone will be included, MObs native to the zone will be listed, and get this - every page on the site will have a discussion forum for that particular page on it!  Talk about feedback, and letting others know what you know!  Also, keep in mind, this is just the begining.  Except much more to be added in the next few weeks and months as the site grows. <br><br>This site is going to be opened to the public on either Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  I will let you know when it does, and also include a link to it when this happens.  Except to be impressed.  <br><br>Also, on a personal note, I know the two guys who are putting this site together.  NiteRaven, Reorx and I go wayyy back, and they are really cool people.  NiteRaven is a professional web designer and programmer for a company based out of Munich, and has been doing HTML for a <I>very</I> long time, so except the design to be really great.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                I'll make this update short and sweet.  I have been emailed by many people telling me that the current fastest spell in the game is "Spirit of Norrath," and not a bard song, or SoC.  I cannot confirm this right now, since I don't have EverQuest installed currently, after my last format, but it sounds feasible.  The thing is, Spirit of Norrath is a guide/GM-only spell.  You may be able to set your speed to Spirit of Norrath speed being a regular player, or you may be limited to the speed of the spells we are allowed to cast.  Not sure if it makes a difference either way, but I just felt that you should know.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Well now kiddies, a few people saw a utility CEQM and a link to a GeoCities site posting some screenshots of a nifty little tool. Well the first several stated that it was a fake and a hack and not to download it it might be a Trojan. Well rest assured I contacted Chaos myself, asked him several questions and he responded very politely. And for your reading I have several of the Questions and answers. Most of which has been Edited, if you can't tell Chaos is German and has as many problems with the English language as I do! :)<br><br><br>Also please bear in mind all these emails were written to him hastily, so if some "Dewd" speak leaks out its my fault.<br><br><font color="cyan">TD> Ah, hehe. So it definately is your handy work. So since it is yours are you available on comment on it? :) My main question is does it still work with the actual EQ servers? And the secondary question, do you have a good way to Alt-Tab out of EQ?</font><br><br><font color="yellow">Ch> It works and I dont need to tab out, I have found a more confortable way.  <font color="red">(PS: I'm asking him for more info on this bit)</font><br><br><font color="cyan">TD> Also, do you seriously have that many checks on that program to make sure no one else can use it? If so you're the first to do anything like that, that I have seen, to keep it from being accidentally released to everyone, nice job btw.</font><br><br><font color="yellow">Ch> Yea, I use Key, IP and Server verification to avoid that someone else except me, use the tool.</font><br><br><font color="cyan">TD> Just another question for you, people are hounding me for information wanting to know if CEQM is seriously something that you did and works the way that the tool appears to say it will (since the guy who has it can't do squat with it)</font><br><br><font color="yellow">Ch> It works the way it looks.. the screenshoots are from the release 34, actual state is 46</font><br><br><font color="cyan">TD> Can I let our readers know that yes you did make it and yes it works like it appears it would. Or do you have any comments I could add, just to keep everyone from sending me masses of emails going, "Dude did Chaos really make that? Or is it some lamer trying to send everyone Virii"</font><br><br><font color="yellow">Ch> You can inform then if you wish. You are allowed to publicize my answers that I made at this email. (and correct some mispelled words :) my english is not the best :) )  <font color="red">(PS: I did take those liberties, though it was very little to fix)</font><br><br><font color="cyan">TD>  Final and probably most obvious question/comment about CEQM. Hey even if you say NO at least I can say that I tried :) Is there anyway to get ahold of CEQM and get a working Copy? ;)</font><br><br><font color="yellow">Ch> No, definatly no way.</font><br><br><font color="cyan">TD> Sorry if it seems like I'm pestering you, but I wanted to make sure about that Utility and all.</font><br><br><font color="yellow">Ch> This project is totaly independent from other projects, its purpose is to learn how EQ works and to see if i could make it. I never use it for playing with my char.</font><br><br><font color="white"><br>So there you have it, CEQM is a Utility that he made, it has been updated. And you'd need the correct Key, his IP and the Server Verifier he's using to get it to work. I've loved Chaos's work, including CGMT for running a UOX shard that I'm tinkering with. And there were no intentions of using this utility to Harm/Hack EQ Servers. I just wish that I knew what he uses instead of Alt-Tab to get around the EQ Screen *shrug*. Please forward any questions you have to me about this, and possibly I might be able to pester Chaos some more.</font></blockquote><br>
