Guess they had to nerf the firepots (can't have moongates can we) but good god, isn't ruining an entire zone's hunting potential a little extreme?<br><br>We don't agree that taking binding out of the zone "ruins" it, as if that was the case then melee players would be at a serious disadvantage. This zone was supposed to be nobind at release, however we forgot to set the flag. It was a case where we either had to do this, or remove the "feature" that everyone thought was so cool in the zone. <br><br>I would say that melee types won't mind a short boat ride to use this feature. <br><br>- Gordon <br> <br> <br>Uh huh, can we say BETA.

Here is why it CANNOT be what he describes:<br> <br>1) The 2 were grouped, not individuals. Therefore, group damage is counted as a single entity in terms of who gets damage. Cleric was 30 levels below the enchanter, and therefore, should not have gotten any experience, ever while grouped with the enchanter!<br> <br>2) The cleric never did damage. Spells were resisted, and as far as I understand, he never engaged in melee (specter would kill him in 1 or 2 rounds).<br> <br>3) It is some kind of bug based in conjunction with pet/charm and mem blur, etc.<br> <br>I sent an email to Brad about this prior to sending it to the site, as I'm not for people exploiting to gain levels.

The enchanter then told my friend (a cleric) to just stand behind him and cast a spell on a specter from time to time that he was fighting.

Something about charm, a pet, mem blur, etc that allowed anyone in your group to get exp from a kill, no matter the level difference!  Needless to say, it didn't work every time, but my friend went from 15th to 16th in about 20-30 minutes.<br><br><br>Thanks to Computer Dumbass for explaining how this works in the EQ Forum. </blockquote><br>

                From Caster's Realm:<br>KUNARK A BUGFEST?, APRIL 18, 2000<br><br>About 4 days ago I was in a party in Sol B, doing the Efreeti Djarn. I was listening to players in the room talk that I had never met before and thier topic of discussion was the soon to be released Kunark. They were talking about how they are going to Kunark as soon as it comes up to get all the nice items its sure to have... thier urgency was for one reason only... they figured that Verant would make mistakes (as usual) and put in some items that were sure to be removed once the players but them to good use. They wanted these items before they were removed (Much like the Manastones and Rubicite of past days). <br>This discussion really opened my eyes towards the nerfing of items that you Verant make happen. If you are playtesting these items in house, perhaps you need a more intelligent test group. If you are not testing them at all, that is unacceptable. If you are allowing players to test these items out, then you are choosing the wrong ones. Get someone with some brains in there that will push these items to the extreme before you release them! Give these items to one or two players on each server, let them test it for you with the understanding that the item will be taken away at the end of the testing phase. <br><br>I am very disheartened every time you change an item or a spell that I didnt have the chance to sit on my ass for hour after hour to obtain. It sucks immensely when you do this to the game, because in effect, you are rewarding the powergamers for thier work, vs. the role players you supposedly designed the game for! <br><br>Please, please tell me, that you have playtested Kunark to the extreme and no items will be nerfed or removed, so that those souls that choose to move at a much slower pace, will not see the dangled carrots move further and further out of our reach. I sit here awaiting your answer, knowing deep in my heart, I already know the truth.<br><br>One thing to keep in mind is that we certainly don't enter into situations where we have to do this knowingly. It's a decision that's made after we've had time to evaluate items/skills/spells etc., and have discovered some detrimental affect to gameplay or the pace of the game. So I can't promise you that it won't happen. <br><br>However... Most of the items we've had to change or replace post-production were created when EQ was relatively new. At that time we were still learning the way that different things could be used to an advantage beyond what was intended. After running EQ for over a year now, we have a much better idea about how all of this works, and as such situations such as these should be much more infrequent than they were before. <br><br>The only other thing we have to worry about is typos. Hopefully we can catch any typos soon enough that replacing the existing items retroactively won't be taken as a "nerf". <br><br>- Gordon<br> <br><br>Note, the usage of the words "much more infrequent than before"<br><br>So, if you get something, and then see everyone else with it a week later, expect it to be nerfed or made impossible to get. <br><br>(Jboots,Mana Stone,Pottery Sketches,Glowing Stein...)<br><br>And remember, when your Magic Foo Stick that you camped 29 hours for is nerfed, you have no one to blame but yourself for not being able to read into the future.<br><br><br><br><br></blockquote><br>
