Or just too deep inside to leave? Well here's a bug that lets you have permanent SoW, anywhere. First Duel someone and die. Then get a SoW. Now get a res, lvl 29 will do since you dont lose exp in duels. Your must be in the same zone as your body for this to work. The res effects will cancel all your buffs, but SoW will remain. The icon is gone, but you still run at SoW speed. This will last until you zone.

                Looks like the "Vox Bug" is a Hoax fabricated by some person that just wants attention. Well as you can see the ICQ # is posted underneath the message so if you would like to "educate" that person about the Fake bug, than feel free to do so. Here are some messages that were sent to me that are pretty funny. Well at least I think so, they were probably pissed that I posted something like this.<br><br><Blockquote><Font color=yellow>I can assume that this fake because the guy lied about the items and if he lied about that then the whole thing is probably fake. There is no such thing as a vox scale...she only drops white dragon scales which are used to get the White Dragonscale Cloak (which he said she drops, but she doesnt because its a quest and its not a robe like he said). Advanced arrowsmithing book simply doesnt exist and the Onyx Drakescale Belt is another item he has made up again. Crimson Robe of Alendine is dropped off of cazic thule and not Vox. Mensai blade is just plain ridiculous...I doubt verant is gonna give a item ice comet anytime soon.<br><br><br>That lady vox bug post is such a joke. Do you even own everquest? You must not, otherwise you would know immediately that it's not real Come on, dont post that crap, get a clue.  F*CKING CHRIST.<br></font></blockquote><br></blockquote><br>

                Now, not only is there questions regarding ShowEQ and other packet sniffing programs, but we have this individual who supposedly has successfully managed to sniff out players account information.  Within his letter, he also explains how he attempted to get in touch with Verant to bring this to their attention, but was given a foot out the door for his actions.  Take a look at what he has to say, and let me know what you think.<br><Blockquote><font color="yellow">Grr.  Okay  I really don't get this.  Here's the situation.<br><br>With more and more people scrutinizing the packet stream with things like ShowEQ and EQitem and such, I decided I had better take a look at what was there and make sure nothing strange was getting out.<br><br>Then a bit on eqvault.com about someone saying he had been contacted in game by someone who knew his name.  There was a response by GZ I believe, saying the guy must have known him and that no personal information was sent out.<br><br>Now I was REAL interested in making sure that there wasn't anything weird being sent out. So I yanked out my packet sniffer on my laptop and decided to take a look. After a while I discover what looks like people's account names and eq chars showing up.  In alarm I posted to the main message board on Eqvault where I know some of guys at verant read messages.<br><br>I got no response.<br><br>Hmm.  Okay maybe they aren't taking me seriously. Perhaps I should double check my data, maybe I'm wrong. So this time I go back in and I intend to verify whether the information I'm seeing is accurate or not. Each time I intercepted what I believed to be some valid information I contacted the character and the conversation went something like this:<br><br>"/t foobar  Hello is your eq account name john123?" "foobar tells you, "Why do you want to know?" "/t foobar Well if it is john123 could you please petition verant and tell them that I correctly got your account name and that I'd like to speak with them.  Thank you".<br><br>For the sake of brevity I've omitted the more colorful responses.  But each time I asked them to petition verant and let them know I wanted to talk to someone. In the next 3 hours I correctly got 5 eq account names and their associated char name. (at least 5 people who actually admitted it).  I also got 8 wrong (according to them).<br><br>After a few hours a GM by the name of Aymeric shows up and I tell him what's going on.<br><br>He says,"verant probably won't like this".<br><br>To which I replied,  "If I can see this information and I'm telling you about it, imagine all the other people that have been seeing it and not saying anything". He thought that was a rather good point and so did I.  He took down my e-mail address and said he'd get back to me.<br><br>About one and a half or two days go by and nothing happens. Tonight I go to log in and I get the message "Your account has been suspended due to inappropriate behavior please contact Everquest technical support". Well hmm.  It's sunday and according to the web site and help file there's only phone support during the week...How convenient.<br><br>Now I'll admit that I don't know what those people may have petitioned... It could have been "hey there's some crazy guy that knows my account". I figured since I spoke to a GM and I made sure he understood I was doing this for the good of the EQ community they would understand. But 'inappropriate behavior'?<br><br>Hmm.<br><br>1- I thought there might be a bug.<br>2- I found a bug.<br>3- I made sure it was a bug.<br>4- I contacted verant.<br><br>How the hell is this inappropriate behavior?<br><br>I wasn't using showeq or any banned program I wasn't even decoding packets.  I was using a run of the mill packet sniffer that absolutely anyone can get their hands on and I was reading the information IN PLAIN TEXT. Personally I expected a,"Thank you we were not aware of this" at a MINIMUM, perhaps some small token of gratitude. Instead they suspend me.<br><br>So now I'm going public to tell you all be very careful about who you talk to if they say they know your account name. Unless verant patched this problem tonight (which I have no way of verifying) then: Yes, it is possible for me to get station names and which EQ account is associated with it (the person has to be online) <br><br>No, there is no personal info (address telephone ect..)<br><br>Yes, I think with a bit of social engineering this could be a very bad thing.  Especially if you use your real name as your station name.<br><br>If my account does get re-instated (with an apology I hope), I guess I won't freaking report the next bug I find for fear of being suspended again.  I have been playing on and off since beta 4.  There has NEVER been any complaints about me.  I really think they should rethink their shoot first ask questions later.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                Here is a letter that someone sent me. Apparently he just sent it to the "Big" people up at Verant and DrTwister. So I was thinking, why have something private? You guys have a right to know what we do.<br><br><blockquote><Font color=yellow>The following information is based on a current situation that involves a few aspects of Verant Interactive, and the legality of packet sniffers, as well a twist of ignorant GMs. This is not a rant, and I hope it does not come off that way to you, this is simply a letter of factional information.<br><br>This all started through a program being created and released to the public, called ShowEQ, I am sure you have all heard of it. If not, the program runs on a network system (using *nix ) and packet sniffs incoming data from Verant game servers. This data is then ran through different filters, and outputted into a readable information sheet. What ShowEQ currently does is shows you all NPCs, including min/max hp and level inside the zone and a strew of other information. Not only is this giving players an advantage over another player, but also is against Verants set user agreement, and I quote Mr. Smeadly the CEO of Verant Interactive inside the recent chat room.<br><br>Smed: Sniffer programs are illegal<br><br>Including his appearance on the Dr.TwiSter network also claiming packet sniffing is illegal and if users are found using them, will be banned from EverQuest.<br><br>Thats all fine and dandy, but what about commercial web sites using the same type of packet sniffers to illegally gain a commercial advantage over another site? Lets face it, these fan sites arent just there to help the community, they are bringing in a lot of money, millions of dollars each month goes to these types of web sites. <br><br>Now, as it was mentioned before, two current web sites has been open about using packet sniffers to gain detailed information that otherwise couldnt be gathered by a normal player.<br><br>These two web sites in question is Stratics Network "Straticscom INC" owned by Ryan Findley, and Eqmaps, which are owned by Kyle, Kirkpatrick. <br><br>The Stratics network has been promoting and using a tool called "Eqitems" (<a href="http://eq.stratics.com/items/">http://eq.stratics.com/items/</a>). The program works by the Stratics network promoting users to download the 3rd party application, to then login with your everquest account and packet sniff item information for them. This data is then sent back to Stratics affiliate site and processed.<br><br>Mr. Findley has taken notice of these emails sent to Verant and different web sites regarding the usage of his program, and released the following statement on the EQ portion of his network.<br><br>"The controversy involves a completely unrelated program called ShowEQ, the use of which has been officially banned by Verant Interactive. The utility that our Database utilizes is very different than the illegal ShowEQ program"<br><br>Right here is he admitting and aware that the program ShowEQ is illegal. Yet he is claiming his program is quite different, which I do not know how. ShowEQ sniffs Verants data packets and displays the information to the user. EQitems sniffs Verants data packets and is sent to the Stratics network, so people can then go to his web site in turn to gain more page views equaling more money for the stratics network. Giving them a commercial advantage. <br><br>He continues on<br><br>"We recognize the sensitive nature of such a utility and have been in contact with Verant Interactive concerning this issue. Throughout this correspondence, no representative of Verant has expressed any desire for Stratics to remove or alter the EQ Items in any way. "<br><br>Very interesting, the stratics network has been around for awhile, and been promoting this tool also for awhile, including emails being sent to Verant by myself, and many others, including Mr. Findley. Hence Verant is well aware of what Eqitems is and how it works.<br><br> <br><br>Eqmaps is using the same type of method only with the usage of ShowEQ to update their NPC list, which in a recent news posting (still in their archive) Mr. Kirkpatrick (NiteRaven) posted a note saying the following.<br><br>"One other small tid bit of info. I got my hands on a raw output datasheet from ShowEQ. It shows the levels and HPs for a couple hundred NPCs in the game. Highest known level for an NPC, Ping Fuzzlecutter, level 69. For all those people who thought the gods were 53, they are 55 :) I plan on importing this into the NPC database, but if anyone would like to see that info sheet posted online write me an email."<br><br> <br><br>Clearly you can all see, each of these web sites, more so Stratics have been using and promoting 3rd party application, to illegally gain a commercial advantage of other web sites that our not. Yet Verant has ignored all attempts to bring this to their attention, and "NO" action has taken place. <br><br>When I took this upon myself to try and get an answer, I entered the chat room to confront GM-Camii with some of my questions. I asked her what she thought about Packet Sniffing, she said they "were illegal" I then asked her why Verant has taken no action against the Stratics Network or Eqmaps. Both times she ignored my question, and answered with "verant is not related in any way to the stratics network". This clearly wasnt my question, so I asked it once again in a more clear form. I want to stress, I was not rude in any way, I was simply a player trying to find an answer to my question. GM-Camii ignored my request, and instead of answering my question or telling me whom to ask, she kicked me out of the chat room, only for myself to be confronted with "Your account has been suspended".<br><br>This let me warn you is not the only time GM-Camii has been involved in ignoring and acting rudely towards players, I refer you to this web site which reports players also experiencing GM-Camiis rude behavior (<a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/editorials/gmservice.asp">http://eq.castersrealm.com/editorials/gmservice.asp</a>).<br><br> <br><br>Again, this is not supposed to be a rant towards Verant. I am telling the public, which facts are there, and what has happened when trying to confront Verant Interactive with these facts. To simplify what I have said above&.<br><br>FACT: Verant has claimed all packet-sniffing programs are illegal to use and against their user agreement. <br><br>FACT: Verant is aware that Stratics network and Eqmaps have been using packet sniffer tools to achieve a commercial advantage. <br><br>FACT: Verant has taken no action against these two web sites, and when trying to confront them with the information, they suspended a users account. <br><br>So, I leave this up to Verant to hopefully reply in some form to the public. Due to your ignorance of the facts and behavior when trying to display them, I took it up on myself to cancel my EverQuest account and buy your competitors game, Asherons Call. <br></blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                Could this be the truth behind ShowEQ?  Not positive.  See I was approached several weeks ago regarding ShowEQ and offered to have the program hosted at my site.  The fact is, Ashran over at Hackersquest is actually a close bud from his work on UOPlugin for Ultima Online.  I have no thoughts that he would be lying, but I also question why he wouldn't have come out and told me at the beginning when I offered to host ShowEQ.  <br><br>Despite who are why it was created, I do think it came at a unique time in determining what exactly Verant would do about a program of this nature.  Was it a test? Was it successful?

The man to blame errr, I mean to congratulate for such a great program as ShowEQ is Megaton.<br><br>After this patch we'll see what Verant did to stop it. (Given that I can use some friends account to log in, because I have canceled mine a week ago.)<br><br>I have decided to not put up the ShowEQ files yet, since it is not going to work after the patch.<br><br>Maybe we will release the windows version of ShowEQ too, but propably not as open source.<br><br>Megaton and me are working on an update for ShowEQ, to work with the recent client patch. Verant changed the packet headers and also encrypted the NPS spawn packet.<br><br>We'll keep you updated!</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

This of course is an exploit, but if people can't figure that out for themselves, then they need help.  There are TONs of places you can do this, and if you have levitate you can reach some excellent places.

Will you also post a list of all the other spots that you can attack mobs and they cant hit you back?  Because there are many places like this, but Verant is aware of several of them and monitors them sometimes.

                I received several explainations, but this one had slightly more information to go off.  Also, they sent in a few more pictures of strange rooms, including the <a href="http://eq.drtwister.com/pics/pic-catroom.html">Cat Room</a>. (<a href="http://eq.drtwister.com/pics/pic-catroom2.html">Cat Room 2</a>). Now those who are thinking this is fake, don't. I received several pictures from the same room, and I too thought it was fake.  After the 5th person sent one in, It's obvious it's not.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">In reference to a article about the strange red room in sol B. Each dungeon has a 'guide room' where they can sit and not interfere with the surroundings yet hear everything in the zone.  All the coordinates are locations in the dungeon so they can look at the loc and warp there.<br><br>Another variation is when you try to cross a zone line and just keep going. Most times it's a dead end but sometimes it's a cool room like my pics here of when I tried to exit Befallen a couple months ago. I've also passed other lines and the only other cool one was from commons to ro tunnel, the tunnel ended with a red void. For some reason it happens to me all the time. Coincidence that I always have bad lag? It's a real kick to stand on the 'other' side of the zone line and wave at people. They try to walk to you and zone, hahaha.<br><br>There is chance for exploitation with 'crossing over' because creatures will follow you only halfway down the hall, and then stop. You could nuke them without being touched. If you try to run past them and recross, this can create a VERY large problem. This is what happened to me- I tried to zone a train and 'crossed over' instead, I kept running in fear and they stopped chasing me part way. They still are after you however. If you go back to try and hit the zone again and the waiting train kills you, your body may be out of reach from the other side of the Real zone line. GM assistance will then be required unless you got close enough to use /corpse. When it happened to me there was no such command. I'm sure you've seen bodies just past zone lines before.<br><br>So exploit and kill them or take a chance at losing your body for a time, heh. This bug is random and seldom. I've tried to 'cross over' while running and jumping (like you would if a train was chasing you) and one key seems to be doing it on the inside corner as you turn to zone. Often you can jump up againest the wall and make it work but who knows.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                In regards to the earlier comments below and on the status of ShowEQ and other related programs, John Smedley sent us his official stance on the current situation. <br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Hello All,<br><br>If there is any confusion regarding the status of ShowEQ and programs like it, let me clear that up right here and now.<br><br>ShowEQ is not an authorized program, and it's use is a Bannable Offense. It directly violates the User Agreement and the Rules of Conduct of EverQuest as shown on <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_blank">www.Everquest.com</a>. Specifically it's Rule #10 that's being violated.<br><br>This nonsense that we don't have a legal leg to stand on is ridiculous. In order to make and/or use this program you have to violate these Rules of Conduct. The only punishment for that is of course being banned, and that's really as far as we can or will take it. If you don't think we can do that legally, think again. It's clearly spelled out for all to see and has been from day one. Those of you who are EQ Players and put this up on your website, we will of course contact you and ask you to take it down. If you don't, we can and will ban you. If that seems harsh, then don't put it up there.<br><br>So, use it at your own risk! We are taking active steps to have this program removed from as many sites as possible. Are we foolish enough to think that this will stop the spread of these types of programs? Of course not. That's not the point. The point is that we mean what we say regarding programs like this. Use them and you will be banned. Don't be foolish enough to turn this into some sort of OpenSource, FreeNet debate. It's not, and everyone who uses this program knows it. It's being used purely and simply to gain an unfair advantage by people who can't play by the rules. Those people are NOT welcome in EverQuest.<br><br>I invite anyone who wants to comment on this to email me at<br><a href="mailto:jsmedley@verant.com">jsmedley@verant.com</a>.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.<br></blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                Well several players were waiting to hear what Verant would state regarding ShowEQ at our bug chat last evening.  Most were disappointed to hear that they do not approve of the program.  Trust me, this is going to get real interesting.<br><br>Verant has always taken an active stance against 3rd party programs being used with EQ.  From the first rumors of EQExtreme to the first actual working emulator, Verant has spoiled them all.  Now most recently with the events around ShowEQ, I'm sure programmers are going to have a field day trying to get something released.<br><br>The below is a statement I received from one such programmer.  I guess we will wait and see. History shows, once one hack is released, a dozen more usually follow.  <br><br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Well ... Verant posted about its response, so here is mine. <br><br>I offered them a legal tango, and they never wrote me back.  I called up there to tech support (only number those cowards had listed) they wouldn't put me through.  I will say this one more time.  Verant's actions in having sites taken down are bordering illegal.  ShowEQ (and my project, now know as NeverLost) are not, and are protected under DMCA 1201 (f).  Prehaps Verant could looking reading this before they talk about legal action.  They can change the packet structure and the encryption all they want.  The project is Open Sourced and therefor, will probably only be slowed a week or so, not stopped. <br><br>If Verant wants to play games, I can play. <br><br>Verant, You're in the REAL world now.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                To all that emailed me, thanks. Actually I got about an equal amount of "Do it" or "Dont Do its". But as for as me posting bugs, I plan on continue doing what I do best, post <i>all</i> bugs that I receive. Here are some of the more intresting emails that were sent to me... Thanks for all the input guys :)<br><br><blockquote><Font color=yellow>Mox,<br>  <br>It seems to me, a primary purpose of your site is to also alert Verant of possible bugs that could hurt us all.  Of course no one condones the destruction of another's hard work.  (Deleting thier characters)  But if your site were to refrain from posting this kind of bug, for fear that someone might exploit it, it may have the reverse effect.  The extra attention these bugs get, insures rapid response by Verant, and the security of all our accounts.<br>  <br>Keep up the good work, don't change a thing.<br></blockquote></font><br>Here is another "Pro-Bug" Letter<br><blockquote><font color=yellow><br>I've been a reader of the site for awhile now (say 5-6 months) and if there is one thing that is sure to kill this site, it is the censoring of bugs.  You have to approach this from the standpoint that no bug is evil, only those who use it incorrectly are :)<br>  <br>Newspapers don't hide the truth.  They report the facts, covering up nothing.  Thus should be your role.  Remember, every bug can have uses that don't harm others.  Here is a perfect example.  The bug about which the author of that letter complains...  Well, I hope it still works because I have two accounts.  My wife has a cleric on the first account and I have a warrior on it as well.  We are getting another pc and would like to be able to party together.  If I could somehow "steal" my warrior off of the one account and get him to the other, I'd be able to do it.  That was part of what happened in the example posted.  Instead, if it doesn't work, I'll have to start all over and try to catch up to my wife (who is rapidly approaching 30th level).  No picnic, and while she can powerlevel me, things would be simpler if I could just transfer the character.  And I can't ask Verant to switch the character because technically my wife and I broke the user agreement by not having two accounts from the start (the little "one person per account" clause).<br>  <br>Every bug has a non-destructive use.  And even if they don't, it is not for you to decide whether or not they should be made available.  This site is about the free-flowing of information.  Keep it that way.  <br></Font></blockquote><br>Here are a couple of Anti-Bug emails<br><blockquote><font color=yellow><br>I think the guy has a point.  Instead of posting something like that,<br>you should email Verant about it and tell them to get it fixed.  I<br>understand that may be a lot of work for you, but you can only blame<br>yourself for opening the site.  If not, just shut the site down.<br><br>A lvl 50 character deleted, just like that.  For what?  For a dweeb to<br>get their jollies for 5 minutes.  The person this happened to could<br>probably care less if the culprit is banned, sued, killed, whatever, all<br>they care about is having their character back.  And is it even possible<br>for Verant to bring back his character?  I'd be interested to know what<br>the resolution was to the owner of this 50th lvl character.<br><br>All in all, I think your site does Verant a great service in getting<br>bugs fixed - keeps em on their toes.  But sometimes you gotta hold back<br>some info.  Keep the good work up!<br></font></blockqoute><br>And another...<br><blockquote><Font color=yellow>The letter was pretty rough around the edges, but I agree that bugs<br>displayed on any site that could do damage to anyone's character in the<br>game (especially a level 50 character that someone has put a ton of<br>effort and time in building) could fall into the wrong hands.  There are<br>those that are looking to destroy or take over someone's character just<br>for fun and that's the last type of bug that should be promoted.  I<br>browse your site for info on improving my EQ character, not destroying<br>someone elses.<br></blockquote></Font></blockquote><br>

                Got several responses in regarding the recent "buy for nothing" rumor.  It appears that the main reason behind this bug occuring, is lag.  3 out of 4 letters I received all stated the same thing.  Here are some examples.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">I have encountered this before.  Was at least 4 patches ago, probably more. Now, while I can't test it anymore, last time I tried (~1 - 2 weeks ago) it was fixed.  Or, I didn't have enough lag to accomplish it.<br><br>What happened was, when I was making a purchase, I encountered some nasty (read: laser light show on the lag-o-meter) lag.  I'm impatient, so I kept clicking on the purchase button.  Lo-and-behold, I had purcahsed about 5 putrid ribs for the price of one.  Now, last time I tried this, the purchase button  would stay down.  It wouldn't re-activate itself, it would stay in it's dark gray "pushed down" state.  I tried it with low lag, and insane lag.  It seems "The Powers That Be" figured it out, and fixed it.</blockquote></font><br>Here is one more....<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Well there was a lot of lag this day and that's probably what caused this, but... I was up in the treetop city of kelethin at the merchant that sells fletching supplies. Well I had sold all of my items and it was dragging very slowly due to the high lag, and got everything sold to him, well I thought I would do some fletching myself so I started purchasing the components.  Well thats when it happened just as I hit the purchase button a huge lag spike hit and I thought I would get disconnected, but it recovered eventually. Now the purchase button was still depressed the whole time this lag was going on and nothing happened.  eventually it did complete the purchase and continued only now, it wasn't charging me for anything. So I started to purchase the most expensive item I could wood arrow vanes (about 8gp 5sp apiece) as it wouldn't let me go over the amount of coins in my possession, but after spending about 10 mins filling all my backpacks and empty slots with these components I left and sold them all back to him making a total of 250pp for nothing. I know that this would be very hard to re-create but thought people would like the story. Thanks.</blockquote></font><br>And here is an explaination that was totally different...<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Yeah, figured this one out some time back...think it's what you mean...  Anyways, get an item that is worthless, like rabbit meat.  Put it inside a container and sell the container.  The merchant says 'whoa, slow down!' and only buys the first item in the container, regardless of its value.  Worthless, yes, but it's funny seeing 'you receive absolutely nothing from Merchant X for the Y', I even bought some things back for '0 money'.  Might send a SS later...not too hard or valuable though.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

So I attacked a guard to zone just to see what happens and I locked up again. After coming back, I saw my target was offline. So I kept doing a /who all, and when I saw she was tryign to log back in, I zoned again. After I zoned I was on her level 50 charecter, and it was now MY level 50 charecter. This is when I paniced, I didnt think this trick was going yo work because I heard it by word of mouth. I camped instantly and deleted the charecter to hopefully cover my tracks. I logged into my mian charecter, and did a /who all and I saw she was on as the level 1 version of her charecter that I created. I knew then I was probably banned and her charecter was lost for good. In the end I gained nothing, but say if you had a mule account that did'nt matter if it got banned, you could make a lot of money off this. Or you could take an account full of 50's and sell it for a LOT. <br></Blockquote></Font><br><br>Im still a little skeptical of this Character Dupe Bug, however, if you want to flame it or confirm it, <a href="mailto:mox@drtwister.com">Click Here</a><br><br><br></blockquote><br>
