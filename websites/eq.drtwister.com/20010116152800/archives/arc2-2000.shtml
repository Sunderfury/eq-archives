                <br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><blockquote>
                A letter came in regarding the outskirts of zones which basically allows you to run through walls.  As always, test it out and let someone know what you find. Take a look.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow>Well I'm not exactly sure if this is new or not but I've found a way to walk through almost any wall.  This means you can go through just about any wall unless you'll fall off the zone by doing so.  I've been able to run about half way up the huge trees of Greater Fay.  I've been able to run through the invisible walls that mark the zone boundary.  After doing this though, you'll usually only have a few more steps before you fall off the zone and are returned to a safe point (I've done this only in Gfay next to the entrance to Felwithe and I'm taken instantly to the priest lift).  Now the downfall to this is that, from what I know, only enchanters can use this bug.  The good side is that a lvl 1 enchanter can do this using Minor Illusion.  Now for the explanation- Make a lvl 1 high elf enchanter and purchase the spell "Minor Illusion" then head out to gfay.  Run around to either side of the entrance to Felwithe (where the marble wall ends) and run up the hill where you'll quickly meet the invisible wall that confines you into the zone. Cast minor illusion as close to wall as you can.  Now that you've morphed into an item, start running forward towards the wall as if you're wanting to go through and remove the spell from yourself.  If done right you should have moved through the wall and you'll be able to look off the edge of the zone or even jump off the edge if you want.  I've done very limited testing with this, only in gfay and BB on a single server. Enjoy!<br></blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

When HackersQuest comes out with their official release, it will be all over the boards, and possibly EQVault. Nevertheless, this release is a good one, and so far no viruses or trojan's have been found. But, there always is the possibility of something hidden in the program. I, personally, have not found anything of the sort, but it cant hurt to scan it with a virus checker first. As always, be careful!!</blockquote><br>

                The following list of exploits and bugs were posted on the Message Forum by AethDivine. Major props go out to him from me for taking the first step toward a better DT EQ site and posting without thought of reward. Enjoy!<br><br><blockquote><font color=red>High keep - <br>1) In the pickclaw area, in the 'lookout' room you can get mobs trapped against the back wall, just pull mobs forward then run back and to the left or right into the corner and the mobs will stick (I know this works i tried it today) <br>2) For lower levels you can pull prisioners in the jail area and then run into the princess's room and hug the wall behind her, the mobs wont follow you.<br>3) Comming down the stairs (the first set straight from the merchant) in the pickclaw area, you have to turn and go down another set of stairs, above those stairs theres a little ledge you can jump too, pull a mob and jump up there and it'll go around in circles, play with it.<br><br>Freeport/Qeynos: <br>You can get ontop the walls via levitate, 1 easy way is to try to find a high point then float over ontop of a roof, or try to get on the door frame and then use that to get on another roof, play with it, im yet to find a building i cant get on. Nuke any mobs from on the wall and they wont come, with the exception of PoD, im still working on a way to get him stuck, i'll post when i figure it out.<br><br>Cazic thule -<br>Down in the sewer pits, in the last pool on the way to the avatars bubble, comming right out of the pool with a mob following stop - the mob will stop dead in its tracks as long as you dont move too far to the right or go back across the safe line (still works, play with it)<br><br>Mistmoore - <br>Get up by the bridge into the castle, get lev, and float across to the ledge to you're left, you can get ontop the building and nuke mobs below without them attacking.<br><br>Beholder maze -<br>beholder has very bad pathing, run up the walls and nuke something, move side to side every now and then and it will keep running down and comming back up, giving you the time you need to cast.<br><br>Lower guk - <br>In the mino elder room, if you stand right where the room starts to widen comming from the evil eye / live side zone area you can nuke mobs and they'll get stuck in a loop and cant follow. Take this a step further, i've seen the assassin get stuck in this same loop, be creative.<br><br>A possible dupe - <br>A while back (maybe 2 months. im not sure if it will still work..) I duped a green silken drape with this method: I put the GSD into the trade window, the same time the other person hit trade i hit cancel, dumping 1 drape in my inv and one on my cursor.<br><br>A possible exploit - <br>You can cast on the boat.<br>Stand on the dock, start you're casting then run on the boat before the spell finishes, no matter how much you move it will always resume. Try binding, play with it, you might find something usefull.<br><br>Also useful - <br>Of course the tumpy tonics quest, work up brewing tonics go trivial at 133, put 1 kiola nut in 1 flask of water, combine to get a tonic, you can get lvls 1-20 in a week working with this.<br><br>Other idea - <br>Anyone tryed dragging a corpse with them off an island in PoS? what happens to the corpse?<br>might be fun to play with ;)<br><br>PoF has horrible pathing, maybe someone should get a slow mob when its broken and run it around, im sure theres somewhere for it to get stuck.</font></blockquote><br>Once again, thanks AethDivine! I hope people take example from his openness and willing to share. Cheers!<br></blockquote><br>

                Well, I got a nice response. Here are some of the emails I received:<br><blockquote><font color=yellow>For the record, if you log out on a boat or go linkdead (ie rebooting your comp or dropping your internet connection) you will log back in on the boat, wherever that boat now is. For ex. you go linkdead or lockup and reboot somehwere between qeynos and erudin (heading towards erudin), if you log on 20 min later you will be on the SAME boat (meaning you will likely be in erudsxing heading to qeynos or in qeynos itself).. if you log in right away (within a few min so that you do no go to char select but straight to the world from the server select screen) you will be on the SAME boat (but most likely not have moved far)... this means that saving does occur on boats to extent of your location. I have no idea how it effects items though.. feel free to expirement.</font></blockquote><br>Thanks to Niak for that one! Here is another:<br><blockquote><font color=yellow>Just so you know, you used to be able to dupe plat using the boat.  You would sit on the dock, wait for a save, then jump on the boat, do a bunch of splits, then go LD.  You'd relog on where you last saved, in the same state. Saves were forced with any trades on the boat, and the only way to do it is to be on the boat and your friend on the dock start a trade window.  All of this has since been fixed though.</blockquote></font><br>Cool! These emails are great so far! Check out this colorful one:<br><blockquote><font color=yellow>Are you that stupid? Everyone knows that it is impossible to trade, splite, give or receive ANYthing on a boat..!!!</font></blockquote><br>Is this true? I thought you could trade and split...hmmm...this is news to me. I'll try it out later tonight. By the way, thanks to Steven for sending that flame.<br><br>Cheers everyone! And keep the emails coming!  </blockquote><br>

                I've been going through the boards, and some of the posts have to do with characters not "saving" on boats. I don't know what this could mean, but it might not be a bad idea to experiment. Think of it like this: You're on the boat from Erudin to Qeynos and you give your friend 20pp, then you go linkdead. When you log in about 3 minutes later, you should be back in Erudin where you started and with 20pp...<br><br>Now, granted, that example probably isnt true (you would end up in Erudin, just not with 20pp), as Verant probably noticed that and fixed it, but I still think there is potential here. You can try different variations, like /split and stuff. Try it, experiment! (Just do it with less money like 20cp or 20sp). Let me know your results.

                A nifty safe point in Freeport...<br><blockquote><font color=yellow>If you are trying to get experience in Freeport by killing your favorite guard or NPC then here is a way that you can do this. If you go to the Theatre of the Tranquil with levitate you can either go upstairs on the stage if you are a regular height or if you are a gnome run across to the house and you can use that to get up onto the wall. Now, once you are up there, you can target any NPC that you want. DO NOT FALL DOWN ON EITHER SIDE!!! if you fall in then they can attack you, and that is bad. If you fall down on the outside then you fall 10,000 feet to your death and I am faily sure that the GMs will not res you for retrieve your corpse for standing on the wall. Be careful so you do not get caught, do not attract attention to yourself, and you may be able to get away with this 100%.</font></blockquote><br>Thanks DarkHawke!<br> </blockquote><br>

                I thought this was important enough to post...<br><blockquote><font color=yellow>I'd like to let everyone in on a scam that has been employed by an unsavory individual on Rodcet Nife.  The individual, Ayedin, gave /tells to members of guilds claiming to be the "other" character of another guild member.  He then proceeded to request to borrow large amounts of platinum, promising to repay it with his "supposed" main character.  My wife found out about this when a guildmate gave her a /tell regarding 280pp she supposedly borrowed earlier in the day.  From what I have heard, Ayedin did this to multiple people today, even going so far as to admit that he had done it to those he cheated and/or impersonated.  A few well-placed /reports should have landed him in some deep crap with the GMs, but I'd recommend that you only let people borrow plat or items if you are ABSOLUTELY certain as to their identity.  And if you should see Ayedin if he hasn't yet lost his account, be sure to teach him the error of his ways :)</font></blockquote><br>Be on the lookout for this guy!
