To do this, press your forward and either left or right key simultaneously while holding the right mouse key down (or the Control key). This will let you 'skate' on a diagonal path. You can outdistance most monsters this way. It is not as fast as SoW, but it does cut the time down on those long runs. Also, if you use the Control key method, you can respond to tells, con MOBs, etc while skating. I once trained some bandits from one end of West Karanas to the Quenos Hills zone using this method.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

What I propose is that like the Druids who are not attacked by animals we are not attacked by blue or lower undead.  Of course blues will join in the fight against even or higher mobs but will not attack on their own.  Even and higher mobs will still attack as normal and green mobs will not join in and if attacked will just run in fear.

                Just passing along a request to remove factions of non-existing NPCs.<br><Blockquote><font color="yellow">I would like to employ your help in a little preventive medicine. As Everquest evolves and grows, we have in the past seen faction adjustments for NPC's that don't exist at that time, and are often completely unknown to the player taking the faction adjustment (positive or negative).  I do not think it is too much to ask that Veriant removes any faction adjustment for non-existing NPC's, or at a minimum, do a faction wipe of that particular one once the NPC/race is introduced into the game. I think we've all encountered at one time or another, a faction adjustment that we've never seen before or that we know doesn't exist (when the adjustment is a number and not a name). Faction adjustments should not exist for NPC's that don't exist yet, period. I know for a fact, some people would never kill a particular NPC if they only knew of the problems it would cause in the future. Again, what I think should happen, is faction adjustments be put into the test/production servers once ALL races/NPC's are in the game. To date, there's always been a mad rush at getting new NPC's into the game just to give the player something more to do/kill/quest after, and without warning or knowledge of what faction adjustment 426 is (or whatever temple of Ro, or shadowedmen were before they were final) players were taking faction hits on something they had no clue what it would effect. Either do a faction wipe once that NPC is finally in the game, or completely remove it from the faction adjustment list until it's in the game so we all know what our actions do to us in the long run (paineel for example by killing heretics).</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

Since the GM's are too busy every run any Quests, I have an idea to take the GM's outta the loop.  We all don't like Kill Stealers and thiefs in the game...especially when they take something you've been camping for.  So what if there was a way to get back them.  You're too low to duel them and why would they want to duel your lvl 50?  Here's the idea: Make a quest for Rogue's and Evil race  characters so that they can preform old school Mafia style hits.  You go to your local Rogue's guild pay a Ruby (or something expensive) and place a hit on this mean Character.  Then any rogue (perhaps any evil race character) can go to the guild and at Random receive a note to Assassinate PlayerX.  Then the person can go track down PlayerX and kill them.  No looting, no reward(maybe), just some fun role playing...and the ability to piss off someone. <br><br>P.S. I do realize that people don't play +pvp so that they can't be PK'd, but I think this would make a cool exception and add a system of Checks and Balances that the GM/Guides don't provide. </blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

All it would take is to have a Player faction and after so many faction hits he becomes PvP.

                One player thought these ideas might work well in EQ, what do you think?  Feel free to share your own EQ Ideas.  Maybe Verant is listening?<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">1.  They should make a fame or rep system, similar to the one in UO.  A player would be able to do things that would higher or lower his "fame". This would open alot more roleplaying opportunities.  For example a player could be a Good race, but roleplay it in a bad way, or vice versa.  It could also maybe allow Evil races to be allowed in Good towns, if their fame was high enough, but it would also banish them from their hometown.  The same could be applied to the Good races also.  Another idea is that the fame system would be essential for the assigning of quests, or for the wearing of certain armor or weapons.  This would eliminate twinking(If you want it gone that is).  They could make it so that a player with good fame would be able to wear armor such as mithril, and a player with bad fame would be able to wear armor like bloodstained or something along those lines. <br><br>2.  They should add another class, called a summoner or something like it. It would be like a "caller" for all you old school FF players.  This class would be basically a pure pet class.  They would have the melee skills of a priest, but also be able to summon a good pet.  They would get a new pet every lvl or so, and instead of mana, they would be more reliant on reagents.  Make the higher lvl pets use more hard to find reagents, or more  exspensive ones. </blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

Here is the fun part, if you do a command like say something then it will come up like this <br> <br>Soandso's_corpse1 says "Hey guys!"<br> <br>Yell and it will be<br> <br>Soandso's_corpse1 yells for help<br> <br>Keep in mind you have to type really fast or some how lag up your connection quite a bit (me and my friend were able to get it up to like 8 seconds by starting newbies and createing alot of corpses.) Anyways, if you wan't to have alot of fun then get a bunch of people to do this with a petition like "Help I'm stuck as a corpse" so the Guides will get it as Soandso's_corpse1 petitions "Help I'm stuck as a corpse" Get alot of people and Verent will begin to think there is a problem and might shut down the server.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                Here is another rant that a player snet me regarding nerfing and other various problems that he feels, if you don't like it, don't play anymore.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Fellow EQers, <br><br>Very few of you realize what verant has done for us. yes, they nerf, and patch, and you whine, b****, moan and complain... yet, you keep playing. Why? because you cant stop. you cant admit that Verant has made such a good game, that you have to pick apart everything remotely bad with it. <br><br>I play a paladin, and as such, i love to roleplay. LoH someone, refusing payment for leading someone out of my way, etc. and there is one thing i do agree on. paladins got the major shaft on quests. Soulfire, and the armor of Ro. yet, i see paladins with them every day. in fact, my good buddy (ok, well, not that good, but a fellow paladin, so i treat him with the respect he diserves(and hes joining my guild, if verant ever gets me that dang email saying its approved)) Dolgare, a level 40 paladin has almost a full set of ro armor, and there is no red cross on the BP, it just looks like steelplate, with beige boots. <br><br>Anywho, nobody said you had to play. nobody says you have to keep on playing. if you think its so dang bad, just leave it. ahha! you cant, can you? is that because you want to see what other nerfs/patches are going to be implemented? no, its because you like the class that you picked, even tho you think its horribly nerfed, and cant stop playing because something about the game is so very addicting. <br><br>That my friends, is a sign of a true game. one that is so horribly addicting, and so filled with flaws, that you cant help but debate endlessly about it. Verant and Blizzard are two of these manufacturers. they create awsome games filled with just enough flaws so that people will debate it forever. (Nintendo doesnt have this problem cos they are perfect:D) <br><br>So, next time you connect, think. is this entire world (or 20 or so of em, ive never counted the servers) enough to put up with the teeny bit of hassle of having to kite for twice as long, or not being able to make billions of plat thro pottery, not being able to enter FP once you get the coolest lookin sword in da world (firey avenger is a cheap knockoff!!!)? i say, no, it isnt. <br><br>Now, so what if your class cant solo well? everyone has thier advantages and disadvantages. paladins cant solo all that well, but have less down time then a warrior, but not enough hps... oh, please.. i say, pick the class that suits you best. if you like soloing, try a necro, if you like grouping, try a bard. if you like being a smart black guy (haha!! (oh sorry, i dont mean to offend anyone, maybe you should edit that part out /em apologize), play a erudite. it all depends on how you want to play. so, please. spare my ears (and ooc ears) by just shutting up about the class debate. <br><br>And finally, i think that verant, with the massive game that they made, didnt have as many bugs in it as a game that big would have. but what impressed me most, is that they have a live update.. for everything, so you cant connect with hacked files (blizzes mistake) and you cant alt+tab (ok, there is one way, but im NEVER gonna reveal how, cos i just use it to fix stuff that i did with the startmenu button (a.k.a the DESTRUCT BUTTON!!!)) (another blizz mistake) and that there are /feedbacks /bug reports, and other such things. even a nice staff of guides (which i want to become myself someday) that will respond to real time requests with nicety and will even submit a /bug for you. so, before you go verant bashing, remember that you pay for the game, you can stop at any time, and you play the class you want to play because you like that class, no matter how big the shaft up its arse gets, or how nerfballed they get. <br><br>Just my 2cp (and then some!!)</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

Probably the most difficult thing to do in a multiplayer game is to create balance.  The attempt to do this leaves no group satisfied, and that is the case with this post that was found on the Monk Message board.  Of course, they did find an interesting way to explain their feelings.  Take a look.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow"><b>An analogy of changes made to feign</b><br><br>Your boss gives you your paycheck on friday, But you notice it is a lot less than what you used to make.

This is how much you are supposed to make."<br><br>You find he has done this with all your peers. You decide to go and talk with him as a collective to show unity. He says you are blowing this pay issue all out of proportion. He will rethink the changes to your salary. He also says that anyone that has been with the company less than 35 weeks will revert back to full pay before the decrease. Of course all the older employees are upset. Why are we punished for our loyalty, they ask. He says his hands are tied. Live with it.<br><br>The pay increase kicked in for the people that have been there less than 35 weeks while the people with over 35 weeks on the job got a little bit of a perk but they still do not make what they did before the decrease. They get free coffee now.<br><br>Now the workers that did not get the increase but got the free coffee instead think everything is ok. They forget because it has been so long and they found a way to live around the money they are making but it is hard. Some still complain, others say I will go to a different job because of the way the worker has been treated, but most stay and life goes on.<br><br>The worker knows now that no matter what he does, he has no effect at<br>the office.

Seriously though, it does give the game an opportunity to open the doors to players who would like to play the game on their specific system and are unable to because they only have a certain graphics cards.  I would encourage any game company to try and patch their games for the most popular cards.  I know that this is hard to do, and is attempted throughout beta testing, but if it hasn't been fixed by now, please, take a moment, and try to get it in now.

Verant has said no change has been put in, but this is garbage, as I and many other rogues have tested and proven this. My rogue will now sit until the situation is fixed. It is not fair to rogues to have this happen. Eben before the change, we were already accused of taking from everyone's loot, and that was just starting to get better when verant went ahead and did this.

This is different from soloing - when you solo, your pet does take a percent of the experience that you would ordinarily have gotten. <br><br>On average, a pet will take about a .5 to 1 (out of 100) percent party experience share. From personal summoning experience, a pet is always worth having in a group if you are in an environment that is pet friendly. </b><br><br>And from player experience....<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Actually, One of the Verant staff members posted something a while ago that DID clear up the group thing.  He said "When grouped, A pet will take somewhere between .5% and 1% of the experience.  When soloing however, its a different matter"  And thats where it stopped.  I think it was on alt.games.everquest somebody did a test with pets and seeing how many rats he had to kill to get to level 2.  It turned out that without a pet, it took 10.  With a pet that did under 50% of the damage to each rat, It still took 10.  But if the pet did over 50% then it took him 20."

I had a monk friend who was same level who said he could not solo these dwarfs easily. I have seen a shaman solo these dwarfs, with lots of downtime.<br> <br>Anyways it is easy to gain a level a day here with next to no competition.<br> <br>pet classes can then move on to the dwarfs npc's on butcher block docks. (These hit hard and I have not killed them, as I gave up my character before i moved on to them.)<br> <br>Dwarf faction is lost through killing the above.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>
