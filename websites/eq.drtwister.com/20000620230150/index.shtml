                Gordon was kind enough to shed some light on two issues that came to our attention in the past few days.  If you have any additional knowledge on the below information, or if you have an unique problem you have experienced yourself, email it in, so we can get it fixed.<br><br><b>A bug with the Enchanter spell Blur which seems to have no lvl cap.</b><br><blockquote><font color="maroon">1:  We're aware of it.  It occurs due to the fact that memory-blur is actually considered a friendly spell in order to allow enchanters to blur their own pets.  Overall it isn't a great concern, since the maximum experience that can be garnered from any encounter is well-within the spell level cap.  In other words, a level 12 enchanter "soloing" a level 30 critter certainly isn't going to get level 30 experience from the encounter. It is however a bit cheesy regardless, so we may or may not work for a solution in the future.</blockquote></font><br><b>A way to get the mouse cursor to work after atl-ctrl-esc.</b><br><blockquote><font color="maroon">2: I've heard about this and we're looking into it as well.  It seems to work for some system configurations and not for others.  In any case, our goal has always been to stop "casual hacking", whereby people who wouldn't normally be predisposed to do such find some program on the net that makes it all-too-easy.  The people who are dead set to hack something, and view every roadblock we put up as yet another challenge to overcome, will always find a way to do something.  At that point we'll just ban them as we find them.<br><br>-Gordon</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                The test server went down for a period of time due to a problem with corpse loot.  Verant has not released the details of the downtime, but if you are a regular player on the test server, and you have any additional information, I would love to hear it.  In the mean time, a letter went out asking for an explaination. </blockquote><br>

He goes into some detail about how Fear was 'nerfed' (not in making it weaker, but making it stronger) and his hellish time trying to retrieve his and friend's corpse.  I agree with Verant about not posting minor changes so things can be a little more different or exciting, but I do not agree with so many people dying and possibly losing their corpses.  I'm not writing this as a flame to Verant, but just pointing it out.  There're so many views of how to look at it... I'm just trying to present one.</blockquote><br>

                <font size="1" color="#336600">Posted:

                <br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><blockquote>
                From the post we referred to yesterday, and to the screenshots that had been generated about the problems some players had been experiencing with the clipping plane, Brad McQuaid shared some insights to what is going on.<br><blockquote><font color="maroon">First, thanks for the screenshots -- it helped us understand part of this issue. <br>Jeff Butler and I looked into this personally today and came to some conclusions. <br><br>But first, some info into how clipping planes work. <br><br>1. When an outdoor zone is exported from the tools we use to create it, the artist chooses a maximum clip plane. This setting affects how far out visibility is calculated, and can affect file size and frame rate. <br><br>2. Most old world zones were exported with a much lower number than most Kunark zones. <br><br>3. Each zone has a minimum and maximum clip plane number associated with it server side. These are the numbers you move between when you adjust the clipping plane slider in-game. <br><br>4. The slider bar is supposed to work as a percentage. In other words, in one zone if the min is 1 and the max 1000, were the slider in the center, you'd be at 500. But if the min was 1 and the max 100, say for another zone, you'd be at 50 with the slider in the middle. <br><br>Ok, so, after looking into this and checking out the screenshots referred to in this thread we were able to determine the following: <br><br>1. For some reason (we'll ask the programmer tomorrow), when rain stops, the clipping plane moves out beyond the max briefly and then settles back at the max. For example, I went to Overthere and verified what the screenshots showed: the Overthere's max clip is 1800 feet. It looked like the clip went to 2000 or so briefly when the sky was still gray and then returned to 1800 when the sky was on again. <br><br>2. Another bug (though not terribly consequential) is that depending on the max clip, the clip slider bar appears to do nothing the last 25% or so. I was in the Overthere using the clip slider and watching the clipping plane distance in feet (something that doesn't show on the normal client) and it got to the max, 1800, at around 75% of the slider bar. <br><br>Ok, so what does this all mean? And could people see farther in the past? <br><br>Possibly, yes -- we've changed the max clipping plane in zones several times. The fact that the slider bar appears to max out early, though, isn't stopping you from setting your clipping plane to the max setting server side. Neither is the rain. <br><br>A good question, though, is 'if the Overthere displays out to 2000 briefly, why isn't the max clip for the Overthere 2000?' <br><br>I agree. What we'll do is go through the zones again and make sure the max server side is really the max the zone was exported at. <br><br>Do keep this in mind, though: we cannot move the max clip beyond the clipping distance the zone was originally exported at -- the visibility data is just not there and you'll see nothing beyond that hard limit. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the old world zones had max clips between 600 and 1500 feet. In other words, East Commons will never have a clip of 1800 or 2000 like the Overthere could. <br><br>I'll also ask that the bug associated with the rain that has the cilp pull back past the max clip be fixed, although honestly, it's not going to be a high priority bug in that it doesn't hurt gameplay. <br><br>Anyway, I hope this clears things up. I'll watch this thread tonight to see if there are any additional questions. <br><br>- Brad</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                Well, It appears theres a strange after-patch bug that happend to me. Yesterday when I logged on, I headed off to Highpass to hopfully get my page 32 of the Testiment of Vanear. Well, when I actually opened my testiment, I noticed a jar with something in it inplace of my page 34. I right-clicked on it and noticed it said "Cinder Hornet Pollen". I then messaged a guide and he said that hes had numerous reports of this same thing happening (this is on Fennin, not sure if it happend else-where) but anyway, he left a note for a GM. When I logged on today I recived a /tell from a guide informing me that a GM told him that the pollen will still combine with Page 32. So its nothing to be worried about, just a strange glitch. Sorry that I didn't post earlier, had some ISP problems that have been happening frequently.</blockquote><br>
