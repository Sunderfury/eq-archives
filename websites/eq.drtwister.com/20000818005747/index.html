So for those looking to fix what you see, this may be of some interest to you.<br><blockquote><font color="maroon">Since Verant has seen fit to change many of the default colors in the EQ ini file to easter egg pastels, I've prepared a replacement eqclient.ini file for those who want the Classic EQ look (I didn't like New Coke either :P)<br><br>Just put this file in your Everquest directory as a replacement for eqclient.ini.  Please, if you aren't completely comfortable with doing this, don't mess with it.  I don't want to hear about people who had to reinstall and repatch EQ after trying to fix their colors. :P</blockquote></font><br><br><a href="http://2amstudios.com/eq/eqclassicclient.ini">http://2amstudios.com/eq/eqclassicclient.ini</a><br><br>Of course then Caster's Realm has this to offer...<br><blockquote><font color="navy">With the introduction of the new client configuration system, <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com"><b>EQ Casters Realm</b></a><b> </b>have compiled a wizard which will assist you in creating your client ini files.&nbsp; This takes all the hassle out of trying to work out how colours will look when you get in the game, and includes a preview function.<br><br>You can access the wizard at <b><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/colorwizard/">http://eq.castersrealm.com/colorwizard/</a></b>.</blockquote></font><br></blockquote><br>

Everything was kinda geared towards the initial launch. As we realized this game was becoming so successful we added servers. And as we did that we of course had to add staff.<br><br>...We knew the game would be popular from the response to our beta, but we never really thought that it would get this large. But the whole point is that we need to keep an eye on this. As servers are added and as volume increases, as simultaneous usage increases we need to increase coverage on the servers.<br><br>I think we've done a very good job, and I also think it's hard to find a right mix between someone who is an excellent gameplayer and knows the game inside and out and is also a customer service minded person.

                Well not mine, but since he runs a Shadowbane site and didn't have anywhere else to rant, he decided to send me his thoughts. Hawken of <a href="http://www.shadowloft.com">"Shadowloft"</a> had these few words to say about support in EQ. Share your thoughts on our <a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/postlist.pl?Cat=&Board=eqwhine">EQ Whine Line</a>.<br><blockquote><font color="maroon">I remember when EQ was in beta and I was so happy to start playing this game. It was light years beyond anything on the market and was actually "fun" to play at the time and for maybe 6 months later.<br> <br>Out of the blue appears a new Everquest "Internet relations manager" by the name of "Abashi". And never in the history of my game days have I ever met a more clueless fuck, and to this day I still wonder how this guy still has a job.<br> <br>I dont know if it is the way he comes across to people (yes I'm sure this is the problem) but I know in my business if I treated my customers the way he treats EQ's I surely would be penniless. He is often rude, discourteous, and downright tyrannical in his viewpoints on what EQ is and what it should it be. <br> <br>Sure, he is probably just a pawn for Verant, <i>scratch that</i> he IS a pawn but I do think he writes his own sentences and paragraphs on his own. Also the fact that EQ is extremely popular and there really isn't another mmorpg to be played right now he can pretty much get away with anything and everything he wants to say. Hopefully this will change soon.<br> <br>Everquest has many good points too go along with the bad and I probably should make links to the myriad of stuck-up, tyrannical, non-customer supportive posts this guy has made but fuck, just read <a href="http://www.lumthemad.com">LUM</a> everyday and you will be smitten with examples.<br> <br>On the Everquest boards otherwise known as <a href="http://boards.atation.sony.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">"whineplay"</a> there has been some new rules and a new <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html">faq</a> posted to stop some of the outrageous threads that occur there. *HINT* (most of these threads were outrageous because of "Abashi's" non-sensical replies to posts by players who PAY his salary). So now If you don't post according to their new standards you can actually have your account banned or suspended.<br> <br>My guess is ABASHI was probably getting real sick of listening to people bash him all day long. And for someone who actually plays a ranger and thinks that they are pretty much perfect is enough to prove what a jack-ass this guy is. (MY GUESS is that he is really a NECRO and just loves fucking with people). <--- some sarcasm.<br> <br>I know a few people who actually still like socialism, but do me a favor VERANT. Fire this guy and hire someone who actually does some good for your game. Because before you know it competition will be at hand, and guess what? We will have a choice on whether or not to listen to your "Internet relations manager" or play another game.</blockquote></font><br><a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/showflat.pl?Cat=&Board=eqwhine&Number=271&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&part=&vc=">Should Abashi stay or should he go?

                A lot is about to change in the way you communicate with Verant and for problems you experience in EQ. The first point sums it all up. Items lost due to a bug will be reimbursed. I'm sure there some other interesting points that you would like to take a look at, from today's announcement by John Smedley.<br><br><font color="maroon">Hello All,<br><br>I'd like to announce some pretty big changes for the better to our Customer Service:<br><br>1) We are making a serious revision to our Item Reimbursement Policy. From this point forward, GM's will reimburse items to players that have lost them due to bugs. We've added a lot of logging capabilities, and the policy will be to reimburse the item, and then to verify in the logs that the item was indeed lost. Please be aware, if we catch people lying to us (i.e. a person says that they lost their Magic Item, but they really traded it to someone) we can and WILL ban people on their first offense. We think it's important that we place trust in people, rather than assuming they aren't telling the truth. The downside to this is that we will probably have a lot of people trying to scam us. Be warned - Don't try it.<br><br>2) We're in the process of adding a lot more GM's. In addition, we're<br>adding more GM's during the 7am - 4pm shift to better accommodate our<br>International users. We're also adding a fair amount of Night GM's to assist players off hours.<br><br>3) Our Customer Service phone calls are now completely handled out of the Verant facility here in San Diego. Before it was split between this facility and a Customer Service group out of Utah. In addition, we're adding a lot more phone support staff to better accommodate players.<br><br>4) We've modified our Internal procedures with regards to how our GM's treat players. One of the biggest complaints we've seen is that GM's are rude or short with people. It's important to us that our Customers are treated with respect and appreciation, so we've been working with our GM's to try and make sure that players experiences with GM's are positive ones. In addition, we've been weeding out problem GM's. Please keep in mind, it's not an easy job being a GM and we do ask that players treat the GM's with respect as well. From here on out if you feel like a GM is being rude to you, please email our new Director of Customer Service, George Scotto at gscotto@station.sony.com<br><br>5) We've added separate GM's for Quests and Events. Expect to see a lot more from us in the near future.<br><br>6) We've put a new email system in place that should help ensure quick response.<br><br>7) A different version of the Online Store will be going up soon. It will be web based and people will be able to order Kunark from it once it's up.<br><br><br>Regards,<br><br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</font></blockquote><br>
