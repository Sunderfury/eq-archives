	<tr> 
	  <td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
	    have worked to get my smithing skill to a mere 43 and it cost me over 
	    100pp already. I have been earning the cash to do so by doing quests 
	    for the various paladin guilds around the land to raise faction for 
	    the Ro armor. I beseeched my guildmembers to aid me in obtaining as 
	    many of the ingredients as possible. I ran for my life through the 
	    rathe mountains to find the paladin camp. I have just today seen what 
	    I have to look forward to *if* I put in quite a bit more work. </font> 
	    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">To 
	      say that what Verant is doing with the armor of Ro is a joke is 
	      a major understatement. A guildmember who collected the data was 
	      kind enough to post the stats for us today and I was nearly ready 
	      to quit the game. I have lost nearly all of my faith in the abilities 
	      of Brad and crew to correctly institute just about anything in this 
	      game. I really wish I could understand exactly what these guys were 
	      thinking when they decided to incept many of the things that they 
	      have. Common sense seems to have blown right out the window, now 
	      all they seem to care about is making everyone a shiny happy person 
	      who does nothing but look to group together when they log on because 
	      they were made to weak to do anything else. </font></p>
	    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
	      you want people to smith, make it a skill that is actually worth 
	      the work put into it. If you want people to group, make it so that 
	      the xp gains are at least close to the amount gained when going 
	      solo. If you want the money to leave the PC's hands incept things 
	      like NPC's who SOW or buff for a price. If you want people to do 
	      long, intricate, boring, heavily camped quests, make the prize worth 
	      the work. Verant creates a quest so hard to do that it has paladins 
	      near and far drooling to see what kind of prize so much work is 
	      called for. They make it so every paladin who wishes to obtain the 
	      armor become a master smith, yet they add no forges. </font></p>
	    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
	      personally intend to boycott the armor. It's crap, I don't care 
	      if it's pure white with a red cross on the BP. I am not playing 
	      this game to be a model, I'm playing to be a headstomper, to role-play 
	      a paladin. I expect that the god I serve looks upon me as one of 
	      his champions fulfilling his will. I don't expect my god to treat 
	      me like a red headed step child, beat me, and throw me in the corner 
	      for a time out. I am appalled at the view Verant takes when it comes 
	      to many classes. However, I cannot speak for them as I have only 
	      played one other character, a cleric, to level 6. I have played 
	      a paladin for years, since the days of D&amp;D and the comparison 
	      is so far off I tend to look at my EQ Paladin as a squire. </font></p>
	    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">When 
	      a person thinks of a paladin they normally think of a grand figure, 
	      smiting evil across the land, helping the weak, placing themselves 
	      in front of the doom of another even if it costs them their lives. 
	      When a person sees a paladin on EQ the thought is normally &quot;Where 
	      is the warrior who's gear you seem to be holding squire?&quot; I 
	      don't want to be the all powerful, I don't want to have abilities 
	      I shouldn't have, I don't want to hear Verant tell us anymore that 
	      the class is pretty good and they see no fault in it. I *do* wish 
	      to see Verant, just once, say &quot;Wow, we really screwed up this 
	      time, any feedback you guys might have would be appreciated.&quot; 
	      </font></p>
	    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">There 
	      are many good things about paladins even in EQ. I enjoy using my 
	      LoH on a perfect stranger about to see his god face to face and 
	      hearing the surprise from them when the fight is over. I enjoy random 
	      acts of kindness in the form of healing people as they rest, even 
	      if the healing I can do is pretty weak. I enjoy running up to someone 
	      fighting a mob maybe just a bit too tough for them and taunting 
	      the creature so the person can finish it off unharmed and healing 
	      them when the fight is over. Seems the only thing I can't enjoy 
	      is questing. Give me a valid quest Verant. GB you say? Some quest, 
	      here I am a paladin, killing another paladin for a weapon. Soulfire 
	      you say? Great, being KOS in one of the biggest cities in the land 
	      is always fun. Here I am a hero and I can't enter Freeport. I will 
	      just have to use the tunnels like the evil classes or a thief would. 
	      </font></p>
	    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It's 
	      not bad enough that Verant does not fix bugs in the game, like the 
	      PoF requiring so many people to live yet it crashes when they try 
	      to gate them all in. Dragons requiring hordes of players to kill, 
	      yet the zone can't handle the amount of people required. It's called 
	      poor planning, plain and simple. No matter how you try to sugarcoat 
	      it, someone did not do their job correctly and from the user end 
	      it doesn't seem like they had to deal with the repercussions. I 
	      wish that in my job I could do so poorly and in fact keep that job. 
	      It is time to stop dodging the bullet and own up to what is really 
	      going on. </font></p>
	    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If 
	      creative minds can't be found to create good, involving quests. 
	      If you can't find programmers who can code the quests that are thought 
	      of. If you can't supply the hardware to handle the people doing 
	      the quests than take the name &quot;Everquest&quot; off the box 
	      and replace it with &quot;Evercamp&quot;. It's not going to be long 
	      before people start referring to this game as &quot;Quake, with 
	      a sword instead of a gun.&quot; I know that no one is perfect but 
	      at least most of us don't try to present the aura of being perfect. 
	      I'm sure people could poke a lot of hole's in this argument. When 
	      the guys up at Verant can stop trying to pretend they are perfect 
	      and start listening to the people playing this game without the 
	      benefit of knowing things like melee formulas or just how important 
	      AGI may be in a fight, maybe than things will begin to be put right. 
	      </font></p>
	    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
	      won't continue my search for Ro, I won't kill a Paladin to get any 
	      weapon(that was just a brainless idea), I won't become KOS in Freeport, 
	      and because of it, I won't be a paladin with any of the benefits 
	      due to me. I won't because it's simply not right, it's not well 
	      thought out, it's not something a paladin would be asked to do by 
	      his god. Common sense dictates much of this and that is the scariest 
	      part about it, where is the common sense? I may have a harder time 
	      doing much in this game than others because I refuse to do certain 
	      things with my well played character, but at least I will never 
	      think of my paladin as a sell out. This is no insult to others who 
	      have attained these items, it is merely me telling Verant where 
	      they can shove their thoughtless &quot;quests&quot;. I may continue 
	      to play I may not, that has yet to be determined, but the guys up 
	      at Verant could make the whole decision much easier. </font></p>
