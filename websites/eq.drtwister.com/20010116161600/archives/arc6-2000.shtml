                A lot is about to change in the way you communicate with Verant and for problems you experience in EQ. The first point sums it all up. Items lost due to a bug will be reimbursed. I'm sure there some other interesting points that you would like to take a look at, from today's announcement by John Smedley.<br><br><font color="maroon">Hello All,<br><br>I'd like to announce some pretty big changes for the better to our Customer Service:<br><br>1) We are making a serious revision to our Item Reimbursement Policy. From this point forward, GM's will reimburse items to players that have lost them due to bugs. We've added a lot of logging capabilities, and the policy will be to reimburse the item, and then to verify in the logs that the item was indeed lost. Please be aware, if we catch people lying to us (i.e. a person says that they lost their Magic Item, but they really traded it to someone) we can and WILL ban people on their first offense. We think it's important that we place trust in people, rather than assuming they aren't telling the truth. The downside to this is that we will probably have a lot of people trying to scam us. Be warned - Don't try it.<br><br>2) We're in the process of adding a lot more GM's. In addition, we're<br>adding more GM's during the 7am - 4pm shift to better accommodate our<br>International users. We're also adding a fair amount of Night GM's to assist players off hours.<br><br>3) Our Customer Service phone calls are now completely handled out of the Verant facility here in San Diego. Before it was split between this facility and a Customer Service group out of Utah. In addition, we're adding a lot more phone support staff to better accommodate players.<br><br>4) We've modified our Internal procedures with regards to how our GM's treat players. One of the biggest complaints we've seen is that GM's are rude or short with people. It's important to us that our Customers are treated with respect and appreciation, so we've been working with our GM's to try and make sure that players experiences with GM's are positive ones. In addition, we've been weeding out problem GM's. Please keep in mind, it's not an easy job being a GM and we do ask that players treat the GM's with respect as well. From here on out if you feel like a GM is being rude to you, please email our new Director of Customer Service, George Scotto at gscotto@station.sony.com<br><br>5) We've added separate GM's for Quests and Events. Expect to see a lot more from us in the near future.<br><br>6) We've put a new email system in place that should help ensure quick response.<br><br>7) A different version of the Online Store will be going up soon. It will be web based and people will be able to order Kunark from it once it's up.<br><br><br>Regards,<br><br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc.</font></blockquote><br>

Since many of these issues have exploit potential, we generally don't want to call attention to them, exposing people who wouldn't generally know of them to them, by having our peoples' responses "front paged" on the news sites.</blockquote></font><br>Please, as always, share us your bugs, problems and opinions about Everquest.

                EverLore has an <a href =http://www.everlore.com/articles.asp?id=172999" target ="_blank">edited chat log</a> from the last night's EQ player gathering in Las Vegas, in which Brad McQuaid announced development on a new expansion called EverQuest: The Scars of Velious. A second expansion had been <a href ="http://www.gamecenter.com/News/Item/0,3,0-4278,00.html" target ="_blank">hinted at</a> last month with the announcement that Sony Online had acquired Verant, one that "may be out before Sovereign."<br><br>That's the only word on when it will be out. The Scars of Velious probably refers to EQ's <a href ="http://www.talkor.com/histories/ancient.html" target ="_blank">mythos</a> (the stuff few bother to read about) about the Dragon Queen Veeshan who tore hell out of the <a href ="http://www.ironcadre.com/velious.htm" target ="_blank">Velious</a> region of Norrath (one that Verant hadn't completely finished before beta ended) to make her claim. And the continent <i>does</i> look like some huge dragon clawed it. Isn't that nice?<br><br>The new expansion, sez Brad, won't have any new races: <font color="Red">"we're going to focus on new zones, quests, items and more variety in how players appear in-game"</font> and that <font color="Red">"Velious will be for levels 35-60 ... the level limit will remain at 60 ... the new character graphics will be expansion only."</font><br><br>Likely this is just a prelude to an official announcement, so keep your ears to the ground.</blockquote><br>

What I'm looking for is questions that keep coming up every month or so from people who are new here on the boards. I stress that I'm looking for persistent issues, rather than current issues. For example, "melee binding" would be an example of a persistent issue, where the current situation with dragons would be a current issue.<br><br>I'm not looking for specific class questions unless those questions are definitely persistent in nature (e.g. Druid class-specific armor). I'm particularly not interested in those that are subjective in nature (e.g. "Why do {class} suck?" "suck" in this case is subjective).<br><br>If you all could help out in this area, I'll put some time in over the weekend and next week putting the FAQ together. I'd appreciate it if you could keep the questions brief, cover only one issue per question, and seperate them clearly in your replies.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>-Gordon</font><br></blockquote><br>
