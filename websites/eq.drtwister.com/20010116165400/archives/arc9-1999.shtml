                <br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><blockquote>
                Well, another patch day has come and gone, and, as I'm sure everybody knows now, Verant has "enhanced" the movement speed system.  No more running at the speed of sound thanks to your favorite speed, buff, or illusion spell.  That's right.  Verant fixed the speed "hack" in this last patch.  No more 7FFF, or even FF speeds.  Darn.  Oh well, it was fun while it lasted, no?<br><br>Well, who says that it's completely over?  No doubt that if you've been keeping up with the message board lately, you might already know this, but I know that many of you don't, so I will get you up to speed here.  Get ready to be very happy, non-casters!<br><br>Did anybody notice that Verant got that patch out awfully quick?  Speed and location are strictly controlled client-side.  There's not even any positively hard evidence that there are any server-side speed/location checks and balances.  Having said that, don't you think it'd be pretty hard to rewrite the movement/location part of the game from the client, to the server, in a one week time frame?  Well, if you think that would be hard, you are absolutely correct.  It would be hard.  Very hard.  I don't care if there are 35 people(no, this is not an exact number) on the EverQuest team.  They simply can't rewrite that large of a portion of the game in such a small time frame while making it clean enough to not lag every EQ player into the ground.  And if you have looked at the EQ code, or even observed the way the game works from inside the game, you know that Verant despises lag.  Ex-UO players, no doubt.<br><br>About this part is where the DTN comes in to debunk.  All of the above mentioned seem impossible?  Well, it was.  Movement is still client side.  While I am not sure if there are any checks to it now(which would be pretty hard on bandwith, especially with the server peaks being 800 clients, almost twice as much, over what the servers were made to handle), you <I>can</I> still run faster.  You can also still give a speed improvement to any type of spell.  The only catch now is that there is a limit on how fast you can run.  There may not be any more FF(255 in decimal) speeds, however, you <I>can</I> still go faster.  The new limit to speed is the speed of the fastest moving spell around.  Currently, I know that one of the fastest spells is Spirit of the Cheetah, which is 100(64 in hex).  I have heard that the level 50 bard speed song gives more than this, and is 115(73 in hex), but I have no way of knowing, since I had to format my 4gb games storage drive(which is also currently the biggest drive I have, doh!) Friday, and haven't had a chance to check out EverQuest, since I now have to use AltaVista FreeAccess until Monday, when some ISPs are open, which puts a big ol' banner access your screen that always stays on top, even in EverQuest.  I can just imagine how the patch downloading issue would go with this POS connection.  I tried to download the UO patches earlier, so I could log on and take an inventory of my account, so I could accurately state what it had, in order to sell it later this week(if you're interested, email me about it.  I'm not going to post a link to the eBay ad from the front page, since I was already a sellout once previously), but after four hours of trying to download the patches, and the connection <I><B>CONSTANTLY</B></I> dying, I gave up.<br><br>Have fun with this, my reader friends.  Also, please do me a favor and send some usable(or even unusable...) material to my new mailbox over at Hotmail.  The address is dtn_baggle@hotmail.com.  You can copy/paste that and email me, or just do the easy thing, and click on the little green link above.  My name links to my mailbox.  Just whatever you do, please hurry, my mailbox is getting awfully lonely just sitting there and not getting any mail.<br><br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Not to fear, loyal, scared, daily readers!  I <I>am</I> alive, after all, and I shall continue to be.  However, there has been an untimely death of cataclysmic proportions on our end of the network lately.  I was heart broken, and shocked at the same time when I learned of this death.  <br><br>This staff member has been here for as long as I have, done more work regarding this site than any other staff member, and will always, always be remembered for the services provided by him through those first shakey rebuilding months of the site.  I know that without him, I would have <I>never, ever</I> had a reason to update this site.<br><br>However, the time has come for his departure, and we all need to move on to bigger, and better things.  Hopefully, you have some friends in real life that play EQ and read this site with you, so you will have some partners in mourning, but if you don't, feel free to use our message board to discuss your anguish, and get some support from other broken hearted EQ Alert readers.<br><br>So, anyhow, long standing and faithful Baggle email address, poppy@invsn.com , has been replaced by the new, improved, slower and more awkward, harder to use, and much more limited dtn_baggle@hotmail.com !  Hopefully this email address is only temporary until I can get a new ISP, and stop using AltaVista Free Access, which is too busy to use 20 hours of the day.  I'll also try to get my baggle@drtwister.com account working, but it has been stubborn in the past, and no promises there.<br><br><I>Geeze, ya don't pay an ISP for a year and they get all pushy...</I><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

Nothing speaks louder than the good old Buck!<br><br>NO MERCY!  NO TOLERANCE!  NO EXCEPTIONS!  WHEN YOUR CAUGHT YOU WILL DIE!!!  gee let melee/hybrid classes be bound where ever like casters and I won't turn run up to 255.  Why do 80% of the people play casters???

                Amazing. One year ago today, I began a small little site with the phrase, "It doesn't look like we are in Britannia anymore!" - showing that there was a whole new world about to open up to us, and the way we would play online games would change forever.<br><br>Over the past year, I've reported on numerous stories and some amazing situations. Several of you have been with me since day one, while a few others have moved on.  I admit, the type of information I present is not for everyone but the goal of always bringing the truth to the players has never changed.<br><br>From a small site with only 4 pages, the Dr.TwisTer Network has grown to over 50 independent sites, covering 10 online games and well over 300 pages of topics solely supported by the fans of the network.<br><br>It's been a wonderful year.  I never imagined that it would have grown into this.  Even at the time, when other similar sites were not succeeding, the players found a way to make this site work for them. No matter what the problem was or criticism, I have survived.<br><br>I appreciate your support, and I look forward to many exciting years to come in the future.

                For pure content here is the latest Official "Enhancements" by Verant. Can't promise our "hacks" will work and sorry there is no "static" hack I can send. Each time I restart EQ the memory addresses change, so those of you who keep emailing myself and the other staff members requesting a "HACK" we have nothing to send you. All we can do is direct you to find a memory editor, search the memory for the spells you want to "hack", read our messageboard and hope you find help, otherwise you're on your own.<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>The EverQuest world servers received a large update this morning. The following text describes what has been added, changed and removed: <br>October 28th, 7:00am<br>--------------------<br>*General Enhancements* <br><br>User Adjustable Clipping-plane<br><br>We have recently implemented a user adjustable clipping-plane. This will allow players with higher-end hardware to move out the distance at which the 3D world geometry is drawn into view, as well as the ability for players with lower-end hardware to pull this distance in, to further improve frame-rate. To utilize this new feature, you may do so by adjusting the clipping-plane slider bar located in the "Options"-"Display" directory, in-game. Sliding the bar left will reduce the distance at which the geometry is drawn in to view, whereas sliding the bar to the right will expand this distance. The following rules apply as to which zones the adjustable clipping-plane may be used in:<br><br><br>- The clipping-plane can be pushed back in outdoor zones only.<br>- Zones designed with heavy fog (e.g. tox, innothule, etc), the clipping-plane can only be adjusted slightly. <br>Additional chat filters have been added to filter out any unwanted text. <br>*Zone Enhancements* <br><br>Kedge Keep has been enhanced with both new items and creatures. Please keep in mind, Kedge Keep was tested thoroughly in-house only, therefore, some additional tuning enhancements may need to be made now that it is available on the live servers. <br><br>*Class Enhancements* <br><br>Warrior - % increase on critical hits<br>Rogue - +8 poison resistance<br>Paladin - +8 disease resistance<br>Ranger - +4 Fire +4 Cold resistance<br>ShadowKnight - +4 Poison +4 Disease resistance<br>Monk - +8 Fire resistance <br>Shadowknights may now use the following spells: <br><br><br>- LifeTap may now be cast at level 9.<br>- LifeSpike may now be cast at level 15.<br>- LifeDraw may now be cast at level 30. <br>The LifeTap, LifeSpike, and LifeDraw spell scrolls may be purchased from any ShadowKnight spell vendor. To make room for these new spells, the following spells are no longer available for ShadowKnights: <br><br><br>- Reclaim Energy<br>- Mend Bones<br>- Voice Graft <br>*Spell Enhancements* - Level 35+ casters will now automatically meditate while sitting. <br><br>- Invoke Fear (Necromancer, Enchanter, SK, and Cleric) has both had it's casting time and mana cost reduced.<br><br>- Charm spells now message the message when they break (Enchanter, Bard, Necromancer, Druid)<br><br>- Magician pets now have new spells.<br><br>- Ensnare (Druid) has had it's casting time reduced.<br><br>- High level Necromancer and Magician pets now look different.<br><br>- Illusions (Enchanter) have had their duration increased.<br><br>- Tishan and Markar's Clash spells (Wizard) have had their casting times reduced.<br><br>- Some in-game Bardic instruments have had their stats increased to appropriate levels. Items effected are the Minotaur horn, Small Brass Trumpet, and the Drum. Some non-magic instruments have been made magic. These are the Mistmoore Battle Drums, the Lute of the Gypsy Princess and Kelin's Practice Lute.<br><br>- Bards with magic gloves and magic instruments may now punch creatures that require magic to damage. <br><br>*New Emote Animations* <br><br>The following emotes now have unique animations: <br>/bored /yawn /agree /amaze<br>/boggle /gasp /apologize /plead<br>/grovel /applaud /clap /bleed<br>/hungry /blush /cackle /chuckle<br>/giggle /snicker /cough /burp<br>/cringe /duck /curious /puzzled<br>/stare /dance /veto /disbelief<br>/snarl /glare /peer /whistles<br>/drool /kneel /point /shrug<br>/ponder /raise /ready /salute<br>/shiver /tap /thanks /bow <br><br>*Item Enhancements* <br><br>- A number of existing high-level weapons models have been replaced with new, much more visually appealing versions. <br><br>*Trade Skill Enhancements* <br><br>Enhancements have been made to the Tinkering trade skill to facilitate underwater breathing. <br><br>- The EverQuest Team <br></font><br></blockquote><br>

And watch out for Hill jumping, just from a little rolling hill I took 2 pts of damage from the jump. So its still all working and very possible.

                Well, as I'm sure you all know by now, the information Stormlord has now released to the public does indeed work, and what Stormlord posted is a very small piece of what is possible using methods like what we have been discussing on the front page and the message board the psat few days.  This is definately a very cool discovery, and I'm sure everybody here is very excited about it(including me), however, this is not the first time it has happened in a game of this magnitude, nor will it be the last.  The idea of a "perfect", "bug free" game are far fetched, to say the least.  <br><br>I know I've gotten emails about it before, and I know you've read things on the message board before saying things like this, "Go back to suchandsuchagame(usually UO), cheater!  EQ has no bugs, and no place for people like you!"  Well, while Verant is definately the best team working on a MMORPG(massively-multiplayer online role playing game) that I have seen to date, they have not made a perfect(as in unbreakable, not gameplay-wise.  That's a whole other issue...) game, and they never will.  Verant will never make EQ unbreakable, just like UO wasn't, M59 wasn't, The Realm wasn't, GemStone wasn't, or any other MMORPG, ever.  Every game, including every internet game, has been broken at least once, by at least one person.  As a matter of fact, I can't think of a game that has been broken and taken advantage of only once.  Just in case all of those lines ran together, let me paraphrase this like paragraph - every game, <I>EVER, EVER, EVER</I> made has been hacked/cracked/whacked/broken/cheated/disassembled, however you want to call it, but it has happened, and it has happened to every game.<br><br>Now that I (hopefully)have that point across, let me tell you what makes this one unique.  Never before has a site and/or network like this one, which is so prominent and known within the gaming community(namely online gaming), been so open with information regarding the weak spots of a game, and in doing so, publicly(very publicly), revealed such a gaping hole, so opportunistic for exploit.  Basically, there is a huge hole in the side of the game, and now many, many, many people know about it.  Whether that is a good thing or a bad thing, you decide.  But, however way you think of it, something this big has never been so public and openly discussed before.  Now before I get 10,000 emails saying, "Well, Xsploitz said suchandsuch when this happened in UO.." or "UOShack said this or that, and that was HUGE in the UO community...", tell me this.  Where was that information stored?  That's right.  In the private storage area of their site.  <br><br>Now, let me tell you the story of another crack/hack/cheat/whatever you want to call it, for another game.  For the people who were playing Meridian 59 back in the old days, you will probably be familiar with the names and events that take place in this story.  I can tell you one thing for sure, though; the people mentioned in this story were living legends in the game when I started to play(shortly after the events mentioned below), and most everybody knew of a story or two, usually false, about what they had done.<br><br>Back in late 1996, Meridian 59 was the king of the MMORPG market.  The game had just been released very few months previously, and still was going very strong, with a very large following, most of whom played the game non-stop and couldn't get enough of the game, much less see any flaw in it.  Well, like any other game, this one had its curious, and its nosey, and, like every other game, it wasn't long before somebody broke into it, and took advantage of it.<br><br>In this case, the curious and nosey were two people.  These people were named Mimming and bigbird.  Together, they would turn the game upside down(their own game, anyhow) for a matter of two months.  The technical details are trivial, but the two were able to change a .dll of the game to  give them any number in any stat they wanted.  While previously, stats were confined to 50 in any given stat, with a stat cap, these two were able to create characters with far, far beyond those numbers, and unlimited, in any and every stat.  For one and a half months, these two used and abused their discovery, until, eventually, they were banned.  Two weeks after their banning, the loophole was fixed. <br><br>Now, during this span of time, the fact that they had super characters was not kept secret, to say the least. They would kill monsters in one hit with weak weapons, in front of GMs, no less, who would dismiss it as a "very buffed" character.  Once, Mimming even reported it to a GM, who, in turn, told him that it was not possible, and had already been fixed.  So, for one and a half months, one hit kills, and little to no experiance needing for the next spell level was the norm for these two, until one fateful day.  While one of these two was out hunting, they noticed a PK in progress, and, being the nice guys they are, he went to help.  One hit later, the PKer was dead, and the "victim" was saved.  Shortly after, the banning occured.  Soon following that, the exploit was fixed.  Two months later, Mimming was approached to beta test 3DO's new(at the time) Meridian 59 update.<br><br>Now, you may be asking yourself what the heck this has to do with anything, and why you've just wasted three or four minutes of your day reading this, but, keep in mind, history <I>always</I> repeats itself.  While the companies who produce the two games may be VERY different(I won't even start on 3DO's attitude towards the game and customers in general), the outcome just might end up being the same.  So, next time you set your SOW speed value to FF FF, keep this in mind.  <br><br>I'll post more a little later.  Now I have to go run across the Karanas in two mintes, 1.5 minutes of that being zoning.<br><br>-Baggle<br><br> </blockquote><br>

You will need.<ul><li>EQInside.</li><li>A Hex editor.</li><li>A Memory Editor.</li></ul><br>First use a Hex Editor on the file spdat.eff file in your EQ dir.  Go over this file and get to know how it works.  Now you can change things in this file and bring up EQInside and see how your changes will effect a spell when you cast it.  For<br>example the lev1 cleric spell courage.  It gives you +10 hp, ac, and protection from dot.  Find Courage in the spdat.eff file and change the values and reload EQInside to see the changes and if you found the right bytes.  For example change 0A (10) to FF (255).  If you don&#8217;t know Hex then you have some studying to do.<br><br>Once you become familiar with how this file is laid out and works you can start the real "hacking".<br><br>Now the fun begins.<br><br>Load up Everquest and get into the game.  Alt-Tab out and fire up the Mem Editor.  If you don&#8217;t know how to Alt-Tab or your system won't let you then your SOL. (sorry Loons).  Now EQ loads up about 80,000,000 bytes into memory.  The spdat.eff file is in here word for word byte for byte. All you have to do is find it.  Its not that hard if you take a few min to familiarize yourself with it.  You can do a simple search or scroll down the memory till you find it.  It does me no good to say the Mem addresses because every computer is different.  But for me the spells started at 59700000.  Now once you find where the spells are stored you can edit the values just like you did offline with the Hex editor and EQInside.  Write down what you want to change and do it.  Once this is done go back to EQ and cast away. MAKE SURE that any editing you do is done in OVERWRITE not INSERT.  The reasons for this are obvious and if you don&#8217;t know why then your out of your league. <br>Now here are a few warnings.<br><br>THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT WORK!!!!! <br><ul><li>Changing Casting times.</li><li>Changing manna costs.</li><li>Giving spells other abilities than what they already do.  (you cant give courage a regeneration property).</li><li>Changing stats like str and dex or the magic resists (these will change but they will not be valid server side).</li><li>Changing the summoned items (like summon food to summon POF armor).</li><li>Changing the Damage of a spell. (sorry no 10000point fire bolts).</li></ul><br><br>What does work are modifications like Courage as you all have seen with the pics I have posted.  The key here is EQInside.  With this program and a Hex editor you will be able to find all the values in the spdat.eff file.  You don't want to be guessing and checking while in game or you will get booted and sent to the cheater file.  One easy way to test if a change is legit is to simply Zone.  If you still have your mods then your successfull.</font><br><br><font color="aqua">You now know what it takes to "hack" Everquest.  I will not post anymore information regarding this.

You can view from a temp file, or save them to your hard drive.<br><br>EQSpells is a program that reads the spell files in your EQ directory and, from that, deciphers various things about each spell(Both available spells that are in game, GM spells, and unavailible spells) like mana required, reagents needed, effect, spell message, and various other things.<br><br>There are more programs in developement right now that I personally have knowledge of, but cannot reveal at this time.

                Well, here is the best suggestion email(and only suggestion email) I have received so far.  In my opinion, this person has some very good ideas for the site, and, believe it or not, most, if not all, of these suggestions are going to be up and running on this site by, at my estimate, probably very early December, if not earlier.  Today I made the decision to switch into overdrive to get this done before Christmas, and in as short a time as possible.  If you have any ideas to add, please, send them in to me!  I can promise you that I will read over each and every idea you send in.<br><br><font color="yellow">Suggestion (1)<br><br>Having played EQ since beta 4 and having met alot of nice people I noticed no <br>web sight had a Best Of or Worst Of  weekly listing. Here is what I mean..<br><br>Who is this weeks Arse of Norrath?  In this listing you can list the <br>character name of the person be they a GM or player, based upon their ability <br>to piss alot of people off and to be a ass to everyone and everything around <br>them.<br><br>Who is this weeks Hero of Norrath? Exact opposite of Arse. The person who has <br>helped the most in a kind and gentle manner. The "Mother Theresa" of Norrath <br>if you will. <br><br>It could be set up like a poll, the winners who are mentioned is the one who <br>gets the most emails. <br><br>Suggestion (2)<br><br>Looking thru other websites I noticed some of them have misleading class <br>guide or quest information and it was done on purpose. Everlore as a example <br>while having some good information falls into this catagory. It has a <br>nickname of Everwrong on the Xegony server where I play. <br><br>With that being said why not have a section called The Truth where you bust <br>the false and misleading information and rumors. I don't have to tell you the <br>rumors that spread like wildfire. You don't have to do all of them just the <br>ones like the new Fiery Avenger Walk Thru. Is it real or fake ?<br><br>Suggestion (3)<br><br>Why not a monthly DTN Sponsored Server Event ... winner is mentioned on the <br>DTN<br><br>Suggestion (4) <br><br>Why not a Player Trader section where the names of those players who are <br>known to be honest, and fair in their trading and prices. On that same note <br>why not a listing of those player merchants who are rip offs and cheats. I <br>have heard of some and you probably have seen some too. <br><br>Suggestion (5) <br><br>Why not a DTN T - Shirt ? Could be sent to those winners of the sponsored <br>events and sold for a tiny profit (heh)<br><br>Suggestion (6) <br><br>How about a Insiders Scoop where you research and report on possibilities <br>about upcoming EQ changes and what the ones who are making these changes say <br>about them. So far all I have ever seen was Brad this, Brad that. Isn't there <br>another Verant or Sony employee who we can gleam some info from though off <br>the record of course and with their identity kept secret?<br></font><br><br>Remember, all ideas will be deeply considered, and if it's any good, it will most likely be added to the site, and you will have something to brag about to your EQ friends forever and ever and ever.  However, sending in an email saying, "Why do you suck so fricken bad?  You suck!" will not warrent even a second glance.  And folks out there who doubt me, don't!  You'd laugh if you read some of the mail I receieve.  Some of it is just downright humorous.<br><br>-Baggle  </blockquote><br>

                <br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><blockquote>
                Could it be?  To tell you the truth, I really don't know.  As far as I was aware, the Fiery Avenger wasn't even in the game, and there was no plans to put the weapon in any time soon(I was guessing March/April of 2000, when the expansion set came out), but who knows.  Anything could be possible.  Even if the item is, in fact, unavailable, perhaps the quest is actually in the game, and in working order(except for the getting the sword part, of course...).  If this is so, maybe when the item becomes attainable, the quest will be the same, and you'll all know in advance.  Of course, there is also the very real possibility that this quest is a total phony, and that it has little to no validity.  While I don't expect a response about this quest working/not working any time soon(seeing as how some of the items needed are "scales off of Nagafen," for example), at least it gives you something to talk about, if nothing else.  Also, disclaimer.  This quest reportedly came from another EQ web site, but the sender was sent this by a friend, and didn't know which one.  Sooo, please don't hate me if this came from another site.<br><br><font color="yellow">Below is an account of the steps taken in order to acquire an elusive, highly <br>prized sword. <br><br>You will require extraordinary faction with the paladins of North Freeport, <br>and with the paladins in Erudin. When considering an individual of either <br>faction, "judges you amiably" will not suffice. You need to be one step above <br>this, "smiles/considers you kindly/warmly". In order to raise faction with <br>the paladins of Erudin, you can acquire a quest to gather zombie skins. Slay <br>zombie sailors in Erud's Crossing, harvest 4 flesh and return them for <br>faction. <br>Part 1: <br>There is a high elf paladin in the Felwithe Paladin guild, in the basement <br>that will reward you for completing the quest of returning Dvinn's Black <br>Heart to him. There is a hidden quest here that he will not reveal to you <br>unless you take the initiative. Slay Lord Grimrot in South Karana to earn <br>"Lord Grimrot's Misshapen Heart". Trade this to the paladin and with <br>appropriate faction, he will reveal to you that a former knight one quested <br>after a "sword that purifies evil with fire". Take the note he gives to you <br>and seek out the Drunk, a high elf, former knight it seems, wandering in <br>Greater Faydark. Give him the note, which he reads, but decides not to give <br>his information freely. The Drunk hands you a bottle, a two container slot, <br>and requests an unusual drink before he "spills his secrets". The first of <br>two drinks is the "Tagglefoot Tingle Drink". This item is sometimes awarded <br>by returning Runnyeye Warbeads to Rivervale in a side quest. The second drink <br>is created through Brewing. Find a craftsman to brew an Ogre Swill. The <br>ingredients for this mix are a malt, yeast, froglock meat, and a cask. <br>Combine the two drinks in the bottle, and return this to the Drunk. <br>Part 2: <br>The drunkard is impressed by the drink and unravels his tale. Apparently he <br>once sought a "sword of fire", but inevitably gave up. He hands you an <br>"Obsidian Key", and when you check your inventory, there is also a "Key Ring" <br>present. He mentions that there are three keys he was after, but does not <br>explain further, nor what the purpose of the keys is for. <br>The second key is the "Shiny Brass Key". This item is found off the Ghoul <br>Magi in Unrest. <br>The third key is a bit more elusive. In the Abbey of the Muse in Ak'anon, <br>city of gnomes, you will find the cleric AND rogue guilds. The rogue guild is <br>behind an illusionary wall, and behind an additional hidden wall within this <br>complex is a gnome rogue, a master locksmith. Hailing him he talks about a <br>"skeleton key" that is rumored to open many kinds of locks. When you ask him <br>about the key, he hints that a rogue carried this key, but drowned long ago <br>with a sinking ship. Venture to the Ocean of Tears. Directly north of the <br>small island with the dinosaur, and slightly to the left (near the isle of <br>aviaks), dive deep under the water and near the bottom is an alcove with a <br>zombie sailor type. Killing him you find find the key on his body, which is <br>actually called the "Mythral Key". <br>Combine the three keys in the "Key Ring", a 3 slot container, and create the <br>"Key Set". <br>Part 3: <br>Venture to Erudin, to a chamber in one of the zones that constitutes the <br>city. It is a long hallway with doors on both sides, one set of which leads <br>to the bank. On the wall opposite the side with the "Bank of Erudin", enter <br>the chamber and locate the illusionary wall. What is surprising about this <br>setup is that the lower half of the wall is an illusion and fake, but the <br>upper half is real! If you simply walk into the wall you not be able to pass, <br>but your feet will stick through the base of the wall. In order to pass <br>through this obstacle, you must be of gnome size and crouch low, or as of a <br>recent patch, have a Shaman cast the spell "Shrink" on you. When you pass <br>through the wall, you will come to a lobby room of sorts, a cubical with a <br>door before you. Hold the "Key Set" with the mouse cursor and click on the <br>door. The door will unlock and allow you to enter. Inside is a study room of <br>sorts, but also a living space and inside a human paladin in chain armor (not <br>plate like the guild knights in Freeport and Qeynos). <br>Hail the man and he mentions two things. He asks for his keys to the chamber <br>that he lost (ignore this for now), or you can ask him who he is. Apparently <br>he is a former knight, seeking sanction in Erudin from the oppresive world. <br>He is a bit curious/suspicious of your presence and requests/demands that you <br>prove your worth. He hands you a small bag, with four container slots. The <br>knight says that the "spawn of the burning prince" must be stopped, and his <br>skin brought back as proof of his demise. The Burning Prince is the name of <br>Solusek Ro, god of fire, and the spawn is none other than Lord Nagafen. You <br>are required to obtain not one, but three red dragon scales off the wyrm. <br>"Red Dragon Scales" is a moderately uncommon treasure item on the beast. Zero <br>to as many as three (rarely) can be found on any one of his corpses. You will <br>most likely have to slay the dragon three of four times to <br>acquire an adequate supply. The fourth item to be placed in the bag is a <br>hammer. The reclusive paladin mentions a magic hammer to forge a blade like <br>none other. The hammer he speaks of is the "Thex Mallet", which is involved <br>or referred to in at least two other quests, or can be used as a weapon after <br>obtaining it. To acquire the Mallet, slay the Elf Skeleton behind the third <br>locked door in Befallen. He drops either the "Head" or "Hilt", so kill the <br>undead several times to get both pieces. Also on the third floor is Commander <br>Windstream, a level 20 or so zombie. He carries the "stem", a two slot <br>container in which you place both mallet pieces. Combine and create the <br>hammer. Place the dragon scales and mallet into the bag and return to Erudin <br>to the hermit. <br>Part 4: <br>Hand the combined quest items to the knight. When you hail the knight now, he <br>does mention "returning his keys", or "proving your worth". Instead he <br>presents a different option. He mentions "supplies". Upon questioning his <br>further, he hands you a piece of paper, a "list" of sorts, with various <br>blacksmithing components noted, such as sheet of metal, ore, etc. Keep the <br>list and gather the blacksmithing craft items. You will need to find a <br>blacksmith to forge you some pieces. It is important to hail him along two <br>different quest lines, in order to obtain both the list, and the backpack to <br>combine all the smithing supplies. (Similar to the Ice Comet quest in which <br>you get both a book and the wheel container, but separately). Return the <br>backpack to the knight and he will tell you to return at sunrise, in one <br>day's time. At this point he poofs. <br>Note: The knight will return to the room at 6am. Use the /time command to <br>keep track. However it is important to realize that twenty four hours must <br>have also passed in order for the room to be occupied once again. Example: If <br>you returned the blacksmithing backpack to him at 11pm, he will not be there <br>at 6am because only seven hours passed, so an extra day must pass. However if <br>you return the supplies to him at 5am, you will only have to wait 25 hours. <br>Part 5: <br>The following morning, the knight will be back in the room, available for <br>passers-by to initiate the quest. Hailing him he requests the return of his <br>keys, or proving your worth, just as before. This time return the keys which <br>you should have kept up until now. He thanks you, and on the side, asks if <br>you have seen his list. You should still have the list of supplies as well. <br>By giving him the list, you open up the next part of the quest. He says that <br>while you were gone, he had the Deepwater Knights forge a sword in reward for <br>your heroism and courage, using the supplies and magical properties of the <br>dragon scales. That is no doubt where the need for the mallet came into play. <br>In any case, you are awarded a "Forged Deepwater Blade". [Forged Deepwater <br>Blade Dmg: 18 Dly: 40 Class: Paladin] Venture to North Freeport, where the <br>Paladin Guild of the Marr twins can be found. Find the guild master of the <br>guild, the one that a level 1 paladin human would present his guild note to. <br>Hailing him will not present any recognition of the journey you have <br>completed so far. At this point, you must have the "Soulfire". This holy <br>sword is a prequisite for the last and final phase of this quest. In the <br>trade window with the paladin knight, place both the Soulfire AND the Forged <br>Deepwater Blade. If one OR the other is placed in the window alone, he will <br>simply say "thank you", and your sword will vanish. Killing the knight will <br>not get the sword(s) back from his corpse. You gain experience upon <br>delivering both swords. Your additional reward is a scroll, as the knight <br>speaks of a "flaming sword" to champion justice. The "Forged Deepwater Blade" <br>will be found in your inventory once again (placed their automatically), but <br>the "Soulfire" is sacrificed at this stage. Take the blade and the scroll and <br>consult the leader of the Cleric guild in North Freeport, the temple of Marr. <br>Hand the sealed scroll (you cannot read its contents) to the guild master, <br>who casts some form of blessing/spell upon you. No effect will be readily <br>noticeable, but upon searching your inventory: The "Forged Deepwater Blade" <br>of the Deepwater Knights of Erudin is replaced/transformed into a/the Fiery <br>Avenger. <br>Fiery Avenger <br>Dmg: 33 <br>Dly: 33 <br>Effect: Combust (182 dmg proc) <br>Class: Paladin <br>This sword is not an artifact, but the quest is long and involved, demanding <br>the pursuit of not just the deepwater blade, but the Soulfire as well. <br></font><br><br>Well, sounds pretty damned detailed to be just some phony.  I'd be happy to hear what you have to say about it.  If this is indeed real, then it is plausible to assume that somebody within Verant is leaking information to the outside...Hmmm...<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                This one's pretty good, couldn't resist sharing it.<br><br><font color="yellow">The time of the old gods is at an end. With the passing of the age known as<br>'Betatest', and the coming of the next age, the old gods no longer hold<br>power over the land of Norrath. A new breed of people calling themselves<br>'paying customers' have settled the land and brought with them a host of new<br>gods.<br>Following is a listing I have compiled during my travels over the land.<br><br>    Sorebottom O'Boredom, god of camping. Sorebottom is a dull and lazy god<br>who<br>requires the same devotion from his followers. They worship him by sitting<br>on their arses for hours or even days at a time at his various holy places<br>like Highhold Pass, Temple of Cazic Thule, Najena, and Guk. His followers<br>pay homage to him by auctioning off their goods to the highest bidder. Their<br>prayer chants include 'Selling/trading rubicite for a good wizard item',<br>'Get in line', and 'You kill-stealing bastard, I've camped this spot for 3<br>days straight'. Sorebottom and his followers are the arch enemy of 'Wizfire'<br><br>    Wizfire, god of kill-stealing. Wizfire is an evil, selfish deity. He is<br>primarily worshipped by wizards, but some druids and mages worship him also.<br>Wizfire requires vast number of sacrifices to sate his hunger for blood, so<br>his followers travel the lands killing everything in sight. He is the arch<br>enemy of Sorebottom, with whom he shares a parasitic relationship. Both are<br>worshipped in many of the same places, but Wizfire and his followers live<br>off the same prey. Wizfire and his followers are hated throughout the land.<br><br>    Nurph, god of class balancing. Nurph is a very feared god, more appeased<br>than worshipped. He is like a plague, feared by all players, who live in<br>fear that his chilling hand is not placed on their class' head. Nurph<br>requires sacrifices, which he gets primarily from druids, shamans, and<br>necromancers in the form of spells and abilities. He has no worshippers or<br>holy places, although his avatar, Arudune is sometimes seen stalking the<br>land, looking for good spells or successful strategies to feed to his<br>ravenous master.<br><br>    Playorun Economie, god of trade skills. Playorun is a greedy god who<br>takes<br>his due from every successful trade skill in the form of profits. No skill<br>is safe from his grasping hands, as he leeches the bank accounts of any<br>foolish enough to try them. He is also worshipped by the many merchants in<br>the land who buy items for but a fraction of their worth and sell them for<br>hundreds of times their value. Whenever an enterprising mortal tries to<br>outwit Playorun, by making money from a skill, he calls upon his brother,<br>the god Nurph to smite the offender and any who would follow him.<br><br>    Powyrgamyr, god of levelling. Powyrgamyr is crazed god, worshipped by<br>hordes<br>of raving, lunatics. These madmen roam the land killing everything in sight,<br>never stopping, never sleeping, until they eventually drop dead from<br>exhaustion. They are like a plague of locusts, destroying everything in<br>their path in their mad quest to appease their god. Once a mortal gives his<br>soul to Powyrgamyr, he breaks off all relationships, leaving friends and<br>family behind, as they embark on their holy quests for experience, fame and<br>wealth. Those that survive the quest, usually turn from Powyrgamyr and<br>become worshippers of Twynker.<br><br>    Twynker, god of newbies. Twynker is a kind god, worshipped by many<br>newbies.<br>The basic philosophy of the worship of Twynker is reincarnation. His<br>followers believe that if they live a good and productive life, amassing<br>wealth and items, they will be reborn into newbies, and be allowed to live<br>off the gains of their previous life. As such, the followers of Twynker are<br>viewed with jealousy and hatred by other mortals. They must endure much<br>hatred and insults, but the consolation that they have better stuff than<br>anyone else helps them cope. You can see Twynker's followers wherever there<br>is a gathering of newbies. They are the ones killing rats, bats and fire<br>beetles while dressed in full rubicite armor.<br><br>    Roel Playor, god of perpetual low levels. Roel Playor is a benevolent<br>god,<br>worshipped by mortals through out the land of Norrath. They are well known<br>for their verbose language and strange way of speaking. Most of them are<br>kind, gentle beings who only want to live their lives in peace and harmony<br>with the land and its inhabitants. However, their religion has recently been<br>infiltrated by the followers of Wizfire. They are usually dark elves,<br>trolls, and ogres who hide behind the teaching of Roel Playor, as an excuse<br>to appease their god, Wizfire. These heretics are also known as azhoels.<br></blockquote><br>

I know you guys will like the new layout and focus of the site.  It's going to be something not previously attempted by any internet gaming network that I am aware of.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Well, I was digging around in my email, and I found more stuff about macroing in EverQuest.

Presto, the key is pressed<br>over and over as long as you want, and you don't even<br>need a ceiling fan :P<br><br>2)This method is harder because it involves outdated<br>hardware, but, to compensate, it works much better.<br>Not too long ago, Gateway sold keyboards that had<br>built in 'shortcut keys' you could alter- in effect,<br>programmable macro keyboards. (Not sure if they still<br>sell these.) I have it on good authority that these<br>keyboards retain 100% of their functionality in EQ; if<br>you can get your hands on one of these, you can do<br>whatever you want with it, and the software will be<br>completely unable to stop you.</font><br><br>Thanks for the info! :)<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Finally!  Somebody recently emailed me with a detailed, fact filled, and very believable hypothesis on what causes corpse duping.  This writer claims in the letter that in his opinion, purposely replicating the bug would be very difficult, if not impossible, however, I think it just might be able to be done.  More on what my feeble mind believes later in the update.  Read on.<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>I thought that I would elaborate on this corpse duping and share what I<br>know.  It happened to us (wife and I), but it was different in a significant<br>way:<br><br>We were fighting a crowd of lizzies in Cazic by the zone line under<br>extremely heavy packet loss, when up comes the Fanatic and we had to run.<br>We were both barely alive when we zoned through - we were in a 3-man group:<br>my wife and I, and a rogue friend that we play with often.<br><br>Anyways, as we're zoning through we get lag-disconnected and have to reboot<br>(which always happens if we lag-disconnect while zoning).  We come back in,<br>my wife is at 1/4 bubble of health, in the middle of the feerrott.  Our<br>friend, being a rogue, just stayed hidden inside Cazic during the fiasco,<br>and when we got back online he reported that he was sorry my wife died.<br>Wife Died?!?  Heck, she was in the feerrott!  He said no, her corpse was by<br>the zone line.  Sure enough, we zone in and there's all her stuff - full of<br>her level 20-something equipment.<br><br>So here's my thoughts on the matter:<br><br>* After you succeed killing something in battle, an auto-save occurs within<br>about 10 seconds.<br>* When zoning, saving does NOT occur because of the lack of ability to<br>communicate (I assume there is some pause as it shifts connections to a<br>different machine/port/whatever).<br>* Lag and severe packet loss causes a "dimension shift" of characters, and<br>for a brief period of time, it is possible to exist in 2 zones at once, as<br>far as the save game is concerned.<br><br>The process for most people probably goes something like this:<br><br>* Kill a mob<br>* Get overwhelmed immediately afterward and have to run<br>* While zoning, extreme packet loss/lag/whatever causes some information to<br>be misinterpreted<br>* Save Game takes place on your zoning character (due to the Packet Loss,<br>the zone doesn't think you REALLY left), but you are killed by MOBs just<br>beforehand -- therefore, your dead character was saved and thinks you're<br>returning to your bind point.<br>* A packet comes from your machine stating the TRUE connection of your<br>character, which is at this point zoning and with health.  This creates your<br>character, with some health (since health is client-side, at least part of<br>it is), in the other zone.  You have just duped yourself.<br>* From this point on, anything can happen (disconnecting, lag disconnect,<br>etc), because the effect already occurred.  Whether you came in the zone or<br>not seems kinda insignificant, other than that the common symptom seems to<br>be people waking up in the middle of a zone, which tells me that the server<br>thought you were moving at the moment you finally managed to get a packet to<br>it.<br><br>That's all my thoughts on this - in my opinion, this is an anomole and not a<br>recreatable event.  I doubt it's recreatable because I think there has to be<br>a brief flash of position/location information that must be exchanged during<br>that zoning period, and it has to be following some kind of lag storm.  The<br>timing would be impossible, and without knowing the application protocol,<br>it'd be impossible to know exactly WHICH packet(s) was being delivered that<br>caused this event to happen.  Besides, with the value of money and items in<br>this game such as it is, it all just seems too time consuming to achieve<br>with any predictability.  My reasoning is that if it happens, a gift is a<br>gift, enjoy!  If you happen to be wearing full rubi or whatever when it<br>happens, consider it an even better gift.  I see no way of this thing<br>happening other than by accident, and I doubt I'm wrong on this.<br><br>-Name witheld-</font><br><br><br>Now that you see how this could be done, let me elaborate on it further.  First, a couple facts according to the above theory.<br><br>1)  After you kill something, your character saves.<br>2)  When zoning in a very high latency/packet loss situation, some information doesn't have time to reach the server while zoning if you get disconnected.<br><br>Now, keeping these things in mind, think about how you could apply this.  What if you, being a level 30 warrior, got down to 10HP near a zone line, with a necromancer partner.  Now, first you two challenge each other to a duel.  Next, the necro pulls you someting to kill.  Let's say a giant rat.  You kill the rat, and immediately you start to zone.  Also immediately, the necro casts lifetap on you.  While zoning, you disconnect your phone cord from your modem.  <br><br>Now, what will have <I>hopefully</I> happened is that the server tells itself that you died, and your corpse appears at the zone.  However, your computer also tells the server that you zoned, and has no idea that you died on the server side.  So, in theory, you will zone and die at the same time, therefore replicating the corpse duplication bug.<br><br>Now, please bear in mind that this is all <B><I>THEORY</B></I>, and <I>nothing</I> that I just posted has been tested.  Please do not take your level 30 warrior out there and kill him while trying this.  Start low, and work your way up if it works.  It may take very exact timing, but who knows, maybe this will make you rich.  Let me know your ideas.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Well, as you know, a few  days ago I threw around a couple ideas about macroing in EverQuest.  Needless to say, this sparked a little more interest in some "How to macro" type messages on the board.  Some people still stuck with the idea of using the Lego toolset for robotics, others thought of some more practical solutions using existing(and assembled) hardware and/or software.  One person said that the keyboard that came with Gateways was programmable to the point of using it within EverQuest to macro.  One person suggested merely writing a small program to delay a certain key, and running that.  I will look into this possibility, but I doubt my skills are sufficient.  I haven't used C++ since January, and when I <I>was</I> using it, I was still learning.  Anyhow, I got sent another suggestion for macroing within EverQuest in my email.  This has been proposed before, but according to this person, he has fully utilized this.  Take a peek.<br><br><font color="yellow">I think you're going a bit out of the way hehe<br>I have an older joystick (ok its a gamepad but joystick sounds better)<br>called a 3d Program Pad.

I have knocked my mend, sense<br>heading, beg, and a few other stats up overnight while I slept. =)<br>Sense heading went up 76 points in one night. (I had a compass until I<br>decided to try the joystick thing hehe)<br>The reason this joystick works where others fail is the fact it plugs into<br>2 places... #1 the normal joystick port. #2 The keyboard port.<br>It has software that allows you to set any button to any key on the<br>keyboard and say turbo or not. You can also program it on the fly, but it<br>defaults to a single press.<br>Thats the good news.... the bad news?

                Geez, I don't even know where to begin on this one.  I suppose I could put together a long list of items about why this is one of the most strangest policies to hit Online Gaming, but I figured, some of you probably have already realized this.<br><br>If you didn't hear, EQ just passed down the play nice policy which states, you can't steal other players kills, or if you do anything that prohibits a player from having fun, actions will be taken against you.<br><br>This is yet another step that game companies have taken to make Role Playing more and more like real life.  Come on folks, give it a rest.  The problem is actually not the game companies.  I only blame Verant this time for giving in.  This is completely a result of the players who whine about kill stealing and other problems.  Remember folks, this is only a game.<br><br>So you don't get points this time, who cares, there is still tomorrow.  So someone is bugging you, go somewhere else and avoid the conflict.  Heck, why not try role playing your way out of the situation.... that's right, we are more anxious to have are real lifes portrayed in the game, so that if someone annoys us, we would like to tattle-tail on them to have actions taken against them.<br><br>Ok, I'm sure I know what you are thinking, how would I like it?  True, this could go both ways.  In Ultima Online, they gave you the choice to get even.  By using in game mechanics, I had the choice of taking matters into my own hands, either by leaving, or killing the player who took my kill.  Can't do that either, that would promote PvP and PKing.<br><br>Until game companies can solve all of the problems in the fantasy world, we will continue to have rules passed down like this one.  My only suggestion here is instead of claiming to pursue disciplinary actions against "bad" players, why not try to work out in game options.  Why not devide skill points up, based on amount of damage imposed by each player.  Why not give points in some way based on first attack, or time of attack.  How long has one player been dealing damage, opposed to the person who made the kill.  Maybe after a percentage of damage is dealt, no one else CAN kill the monster unless you are in a group.  There are any number of logical game alternatives. <br><br>Verant suggested that this was "Customer Service" motivated, but what they didn't look at, is by threatening actions against players, you have taken a step back.  Don't ever threaten players in a customer service move.  Try to work out the problem with them, and if nothing else, don't do anything, remember folks, this is just a game.</blockquote><br>

Send a guide or GM a tell and tell them specifically that "I have been waiting for... time and I need ..." and I'm pretty sure that they'll send a /tell back and you won't have to petition (If it's severe and not a "Oo, this guy's Kill Stealing" problem.)<br><br>Also, about the guy who found 80000pp on the ground, that should've been seen coming. A GM is not going to believe that you found it on the ground when I'm sure they get more than one of that same excuse.<br><br>-Hinl, Hwin, Mayso (Fennin Ro Server)<br>-Ferret (Napa Valley Server)<br></font><br><br>Hey finally someone that wrote to me and wanted me to post their name. Also his comment about #6 that they can terminate your account whenever the moon is blue, full, half moon, waxing, waning. When they get up on the wrong side of the bed etc.. Could be ruled illegal in some states, but no one has yet tried to sue Verant, maybe because the cost isn't worth it.</blockquote><br>

                <br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><blockquote>
                New Producer Letter - Customer Support <br>An new Producer Letter has been posted on the official EverQuest site. This week's edition is somewhat different, instead of being written by EverQuest Producer Brad McQuaid, it is written by Verant's Customer Service Manager Jeff Butler. In it he talks about customer service, policy and GMs. Here's the complete letter: <br>10/20/99<br>Hello everyone,<br>Brad invited me to fill in this week, as the topic for this Producer&#8217;s Letter was customer service-related. I would like to take this opportunity to give everyone an overview of the policy enhancements we are planning for EverQuest Customer Service. <br><br>Our original policies were designed to preserve EverQuest&#8217;s high-fantasy online role-playing environment. Like EverQuest itself, many of these policies were innovative, having never before been pursued in massively multiplayer online gaming. Although some were skeptical, we were committed to our naming and guilding policies, and to controlling more serious problems like harassment and abuse. Our basic customer service philosophy could be summed up with this statement "One player should never be permitted to intentionally ruin the play experience of another". EverQuest was created and maintained with that simple concept in mind. We have learned a lot in the seven months since EverQuest launched. Armed with that experience, we are ready to commit to an even higher level of service.<br><br>We are referring to these changes as the "Play Nice Policies". It is our intent to further define our responsibilities as EverQuest customer service representatives, and to provide resolutions when players come into conflict over in-game issues. The policy changes will directly affect how and when we will mediate for players in dispute. When the policies are implemented, our staff will be taking action to diffuse situations before they become so frustrating that a player&#8217;s enjoyment of the game is compromised. One of the most serious concerns that we often hear from players is that Guides and GM&#8217;s cannot always provide help. In these situations we will now be able to assist. <br><br>Before I delve into the policy changes, there is a point I would like to stress. EverQuest players are encouraged to make every effort to interact positively and cooperate with their fellow gamers. Our firm commitment to this ideal is reflected in these policies. Players who wish to destroy the gaming experience of others are not welcome in EverQuest, and will be removed from the game without hesitation.<br><br>Play Nice Policies: A revision to the GM/Guide FAQ and Rules of Conduct.<br><br>Kill Stealing will now be regarded as disruption and will result in disciplinary action when witnessed by any GM or Guide. The GM or Guide will review these situations on an individual basis and issue a decision which is considered binding upon all parties involved. This may include a requirement to depart the immediate zone or spawn area. Kill Stealing is defined as attacking an NPC with the intent to deprive another player or group of the experience or loot from that NPC. This practice commonly occurs in popular spawn areas. In these instances, the player or group who was first on the scene will have the rights to the kill. Players are encouraged to cooperate in these situations! <br><br>Intentional Training of NPC&#8217;s and PvP Switch Avoidance will result in immediate disciplinary action when witnessed by a GM or Guide. We are aware that accidents often happen causing unintentional Trains, and will scrutinize each report of this activity closely. <br><br>Fraud in all transactions between players will result in disciplinary action when confirmed by a GM. An example of this activity would be offering to recover the possessions from the corpse of another player, and refusing to return that property to it&#8217;s owner. Secure Trade Window Circumvention involving the sale of items in-game between players will also be prohibited and punishable under this rule. <br><br>The definition of Harassment will be expanded to include any use of any functionality to harm or otherwise inconvenience another player. An example of this would be dispelling another player&#8217;s protective spells without his consent. As always, measures will be taken in game code to prevent these activities. <br><br>Yielding the Right of Way is an issue where players choose to camp spawn sites (usually for treasure) where the monsters do not provide experience. This problem is initially being addressed in a broad plan involving changes to popular spawn areas and the inclusion of new quests. If and when we are comfortable with the success of these changes, we will consider the implementation of the Yield rule. This will require higher-level players or groups to yield to lower-level players in any situation where the NPC&#8217;s being fought consider green to the higher-level players. Due to the controversial nature of this issue, we will be conducting a comprehensive poll on this specific subject. <br><br>In the PvP+ environment, several issues will now be included in the definition of harassment. Bind Point Camping, or the practice of killing a player multiple times at his or her bind point. Corpse Camping, in which players lie in wait (often invisible or hidden) to kill another player who is returning to loot their corpse after a death. Zone Border Camping, which occurs when players attack other players before they obtain control of their character after crossing a zone boundary. <br><br>Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a broader basis. Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct may be disbanded. In addition, Monopolizing numerous spawn areas with the intent to exclude other players will not be permitted. If investigated and verified by a GM, Monopolizing will result in the disbanding of the guild. <br>I will paraphrase from the current GM/Guide FAQ as a reminder for anyone who may not be familiar with our responsibilities as they relate to the enforcement of our customer service policies. Verant GM Administrators review records of disciplinary incidents on a daily basis. Action is taken based on the severity and nature of the offense, and/or the number of warnings issued to the customer. These actions may include but are not limited to, temporary suspension or permanent banning from the game. Be advised that you may not receive any notification or warnings, in-game or otherwise, prior to disciplinary action being taken against your account.<br>As an additional note, please be aware that the /report command is to be used in conjunction with the /petition function for players to inform us of violations of the Rules of Conduct in all issues related to verbal harassment or threats and offensive language. After executing the /report command in one of these situations, remember to follow up with a /petition so that the situation can be promptly addressed.<br><br>We will be using the polling function of the Chat Server to gather your opinions on these subjects, and determine what issues are most important to you as EverQuest players. Implementation of the Play Nice Policies, in whole or in part, will be made contingent upon that determination. You will see an official notice on the patch server message and at www.everquest.com prior to the enforcement of these policies. Until that time, the standard policies will remain in effect.<br><br>Although you&#8217;re in OUR world now, YOU are the characters whose lives and stories make EverQuest what it is today. You are the most important part of our world. We will continue to improve our policies and service to provide you with the best online gaming experience possible. <br><br>Thanks to everyone for taking the time to read this. From myself, the GM&#8217;s and Guides, and everyone in the EverQuest Customer Service Department, have fun and Play Nice!!!<br><br>&#8211;Jeff Butler<br>Lead GM EverQuest<br>Customer Service Manager<br>Verant Interactive, Inc<br></blockquote><br>

                While we look at possible GM curruption within the gaming worlds that we play in, we must also take the same amount of time to see what players feel on the other side of the scope.  Take a look at this letter.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Ok I admit.. I read those letters in letters about abuse and all I have to say is wow. I thinking to myself even though I've been banned along with my buddy Wrinkle N'Time I have recieved nothing but good treatment from everyone at Verant.<br><br>One I duped my ass off with our drop money, camp with bag open,come back and pick it up and poof double your funds. Yeah I know nobody ever got to use it because I told the gms about it so I could save my ass and proceed to find more bugs. But I must admit I was treated perfectly by the staff even though I admitted to exploiting. I wasn't alerted of my pending ban and the GM did pop out of no where and tell me " Hello Braxxt, I am here to alert you of your suspension pending ban for improper behavior." or something like that. Ok was'nt a  big surprise being that I had lvl 2 characters with about 50k in the bank and no lvl 50 on my account to cover for em. If thats possible. Ok I snickered because I was like shoot they got us. SO monday comes (or was it tuesday) and I call the Cust Support and the guy tells me very nicely that I had to email my servers gm and ask him myself. He gave me the email and was very cool. I emailed the GM of the server I got caught on (me and Wrinkle had mutiple servers with characters holding duped money) He responded the next day and gave me a full explanation. So I talked to Wrinkle and he was told me to save myself because I was better at finding stuff. That I did I got on a friends account contacted Guide Amiton and gave him the exact procedure and made an innocent story about my account being abused by my younger brother before I had a chance to report the bug. I told the GM in an email sent along with a chat log the story he emails me the next day saying "ok Since it seems you were the one who reported it We wont ban I talked it over with a few GM's and you'll be back in a week but when you get back on I'll have to remove your "extra" equipment." Week ends I got back on and was logged on to the server and contacted him. I acted surprised by my little brothers good taste in equipment hehe. He deleted all the stuff and I was like cool I'm free. I ran over to another server and proceeded my activities there. Got caught again because the GM still had my account copyed over to his so basically he saw everything I was doing. Banned gone from EQ and now playing Asherons Call. I must say my experiences of banning were very pleasant because the second time I called after ban with another story the Cus Support guy was like Your Joking right and I admited ok I got caught cheating and was about to hang up and he said something about another guy with the same story I had  (which was that all my stuff was twinked from older friends..yeah I know it was stupid) so I asked em who and he told me it was Wrinkle (not going to say his real name) So I laughed my ass off and told him it was my partner. Above all the whole staff was really cool about everything and even when I petitioned for stuff I never waited more than 30minutes. So maybe it depends on the server. But I must admit for someone who is a confirmed cheater I was still respected by the staff.<br><br>Sincerely<br>Cros Ka'Daver</blockquote></font><br></blockquote><br>

                Well now I have a small update to follow the past few posts, maybe shine a little light at Verant on who I really am. Muahahaha. Seriously I have applied for a Guide position simply because this is a community game and the few servers I've played on appear to be severly lacking on "Visible" GM/Guides. I also know that Stormlord at least filled out the app as well and I have an inkling that several others did just to see if they could get in. Also if you wanna know where the App is located, here the address is <a href="http://guideapp.989studios.com">http://guideapp.989studios.com<br></a>.

                This situation reminds me alot about <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/uoevil">Greybeard</a> with <a href="http://www.wtfman.com">WTFMan.Com</a>. Although Greybeard's situation was that he broke into OSI's IRC Channel with a friend's assistance, they claim to have banned him for breaking into their IRC Channel which to them is "In Game" and is treated as such, although the allegations of him using some colorful words are unfounded. This guy gave Smelly a piece of his mind and was threatened to be banned.<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>You have no idea. This company is as crooked as my friend Todd's teeth, and thats pretty damn crooked. I was threatened not long ago of being permanently banned from EQ by John Smedley himself for using bad language in an e-mail to him!!!! What the hell does an e-mail have to do with the game? This was actually the latest abuse I have endured. I have endured many other stories. Perhaps the better business bureau can be notified or maybe someone can hire a lawyer to play and witness first hand the abuse of power. This crooked company does not realize that we bought our right to play EverQuest when we purchased the game. Hip hip hooray for a company to make a game like EQ for us to play but thats as far as they go because the game belongs to us after we buy it. These people are extremely mischievious. People buy this game to play with other people not to be ruled by powertrip asshole employees of some crooked company. They ban people left and right at the drop of a hat. From what I have experienced this company is just another fly by night company where they pull you in with sweetness until they get your money then they shit all over you. Also, isnt it illegal to be charged while suspended? Can Sony be notified? What can be done about these shamless rats? Let me tell you something, if you have not run into the assholes I have yet then you dont know where im coming from. Give it time, I promise you'll get your turn.<br><br>WHERES JIMMY HOFFA ?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!<br></font><br><br>Honestly I feel like EQ stole alot of OSI's GM Population, particularly the Corrupt ones, I've heard all kinds of things from good things (mostly of the Guides) to bad things about the pissy GMs and how "they decide what happenes" on "their" server. Verant needs to bitchslap these people and give them a set of rules that are strict, that they can't simply bend and that we can /report them for it if they don't do what their supposed to. So what do you think?</blockquote><br>

                So we have a DE that enters Freeport, because of the strafe bug his corpse slides for an indefinate amount of time to a new spot. GMs refuse to help him even though he definately can't get to his corpse to recover it. They tell him to "TRUST" another player with his Entire belongings, and with people like our friends at <a href="http://www.eqidiots.com">EQ Idiots</a>, would you trust anyone with your belongings?<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>Ok, this is a tale of a Dark Elf trying to be in North Freeport(where bank is so i can buy and sell stuff better). Ok, i say near entrance of North Freeport not thinking any guards would come over here. I bought and sold a few things down there. When suddenly a guard appeared and Oppened a can of woop-ass on me.<br> <br>For those of you who dont know there is a bug where if u strafe right before u die, u keep moveing while u are uncouncious.<br> <br>I thought i could bake it to zone and strafed along happily but didnt make it. So i thought cool, i would come back in and get it. I came back in. Guard still there, killed me AGAIN. So i am beggining to wonder if i am going to be able to get my corpse back. So this time i made it through. Hurray i thought. But it wasnt so easy. I found one of my corpses(Also there is weird thing in north freeport if u zone in near newbie area to north freeport. u come in one a line everytime, this is not the same line u cross to zone back tho??) Well, i looked all over the place near zone. It wasnt anywhere, either of them. So i crossed the zone point, so i thought, but i didnt zone. I found my second corpse right near the zone to West Freeport. Thats cool i thought my corpse was in a wall. So i started running around and typing /corpse every 2 seconds to no avail. So i gave a /shout if anyone had seen my corpse. Someone /told me that my corpse was near teh zone in that is right by the magic area in west freeport? WTF? So i zone in from there(DE's cant walk all over the place there. I look all over the place. This guy is standing over my corpse but i cant find it. To put it frankly. I didnt trust this guy. I was a level 6 DE SK that was heavily twinked by my level 50 brother, cousin and cousin's brother(Nice family=)). I am only 15 and would get jumped if i lost all there crap. But I calmly petitioned them(even tho i was close to losing everything!). 1 hour later i got a response giving me some instructions. So i did everything they told me to do(Lets see, i had already done everything they told me to do, and then some, What idiots!). Nothing worked. I told them that someone can see my corpse but i cant. The GM simply said, if they can see your corpse but u cant, /consent them. I was like, WTF?!?! Ok, lets trust Full steel and a GZ to a newbie. Luckily a level 50 came by and they looted it. Thank god, i was level 6, and my corpse mysteriously lasted 2 hours. I was forced to trust my life savings(err my families) to a complete stranger. I have actually told 3 people about this game, and they all have it now. thats like 400$ i have gotten to them(including myself) And this is how they repay me? By almost losing everything I have??<br></font><br><br>Anyways to make a long story short basically he went into Freeport knowing he is KOS to all the Guards. We all know the Dangers and that you can definately get around Freeport anyways as long as you Go through the underground Tunnel and avoid Guards you'll be fine. Or if your sneak/hide is good enough you can choose that. And we ALL know that Occasionally the Guards don't follow a predefined path (generally because they were chasing a DE down or anyone else KOS). So is it GM Abuse or are they sticking to their policies... you decide.</blockquote><br>

                The following story was sent to me by one of our readers, believe or not, I really don't care but even if this was fake its a pretty accurate account of how the GMs and Support Reps are treating all of us. GMs ban without warning, then never assist you when you're hurting. Friend of mine lost his corpse completely was told a GM was looking into it and thats all he's gotten for the past 5 days from Guides, it has been reported and the GM is looking into it.<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>This happened a month or so ago (I have everything documented at home; phone calls recorded, emails saved, etc.). <br><br>I was playing EQ on a weekend (Sat. morning). Was playing with a friend. I was in Qeynos waiting for a boat. I was walking around and found 80,000 plat laying on the ground under the docks! Now this may seem absurd, but it's 100% true. So, of course, I take it (8,000 plat at a time cause it was too heavy) and put it in the bank. So of course I'm excited. I have enough money for me, and all my friends for a long, long time. However, that's not the point. <br><br>So, after about an hour, I log off to go to the store with my girlfriend and do other odds and ends all day. Sunday morning I start up EQ to log back in, and I get the message that "I've been suspended for an indefinite amount of time for my conduct" (something like that). This was a three day weekend and I was looking forward to play the game that I PAY FOR! I was pissed to say the least. <br><br>So, I email them... nothing, no reply. Tuesday morning I call them. I'm calm because I figure, hey, I'm in the right here, I've never done a damn thing wrong in the game... ever. I rarely play as it is... I go to work and to school so I have little time to play. The rep tells me that he'll check and call me back. When he calls me back, he says that he spoke with a GM and that I have been duplicating money in the game. So of course I tell him, I'm sorry, but I have not. He asks where I got 80k pp from and I tell him. <br><br>At this point, the phone rep (which is absurdly rude already; do these people never go through any type of customer support training?) puts me on hold to talk to the GM again. He comes back and says, word for word now, "I'm sorry, but we're not buying that!" Ok, at this point, I was livid... but still talked calmly. I said "what do you mean, 'you're not buying this?'" That just fact... it's what happened. He basically said 'oh well' and that I will be suspended until they have time to look into the records. I ask him for proof and he says he doesn't need any. I ask to talk to someone else... his supervisor, he says no! <br><br>Now, he's beginning to get irritated at me. He tells me, and this is another quote, "Look, I get calls all day FROM PEOPLE LIKE YOU, you've been banned until we decide to permenantly ban you or let you off." ....people like me? Oh my God! I could not believe I was hearing this from an actual phone rep at a big company like this! It's seriously unbelievable. <br><br>They give you no options, nothing. You can't do a single thing, they say you're in the wrong, you're screwed. You're guilty until proven inocent! Eventually, I hang up because there's nothing I can do... it was like talking to a wall that had no case against you, but there's nothing you could do anyway. Their phone reps don't reason, and are horrible at their jobs (I was a phone rep for a very well know company for years, I know what it's like, and what is entailed as far as consumer service). <br><br>So, about a week and a half later, I try and sign on, and I was able to get in. My suspension for doing nothing had been lifted. <br><br>In conclusion, here's what happened: <br>1) Suspension from a product that I bought and pay monthly to use for no reason. <br>2) I was unable to play even though I was paying for it and they realized that I had done nothing wrong. This in itself is illegal. I was not reimbursed any money. <br>3) I was treated horribly by their reps, never got a reply on any email, and refused any service. <br>4) The rep basically insulted me by saying that he gets 'people like me' calling him all the time. <br><br>This has gone on for way too long. It's simply not legal. Someone needs to bring these jerks to their knees by sueing them. I'd be a wittness... I'd love to help out. <br><br>That's my story.... <br></font><br><br>My thoughts on this is they saw that he mysteriously accrued 80k in plat within 24 hours and banned him on the spot for it. What happened to talks, warnings etc? Obviously Verant has strayed from the model they originally created at the end of the Beta. You know I remember Verant publicizing the list(s) of people it banned, of actually warning you before hand, giving you a chance to defend yourself and last but not least, gave a fluck about its players. Now that they have been up and running for what 7 months now? They stopped caring after the 2nd month of official release, which pisses me off on that end.<br><br>So hey all you dupers out there, wanna get someone banned quickly? Drop 50 or 80k in plat on the ground and let people bank it. Raise the eyebrow of the GMs and watch people get needlessly banned. (I'm kidding don't do this, you'll probably get me banned by mistake, the greedy little fluck that I am).</blockquote><br>

                <font color="yellow">macroing any thing that is one maybe 2 button presses is not that hard,a long time ago when Eq first came out i had a monk and wated med maxed for my lvl,so i took a rotating fan and thread set the fan to turn left and right,as it did this the thread was ran through a plant hanger i hammerd into the cealing of my room,on the end of the thread was a ruler taped to the cover of a book.ok so now we have a fan turning and the thread going through the plant hanger is actualy pulling the ruler up and down,while the tape and book cover helps keep it all stable and going ina straight line and finaly i taped an eraser to the end of the ruler as the actual button presser now just set it up to hit the desired hot key oh and put a light weight near the eraser so it has enough weight to press the keyboard button.ok its a bit over done but it worked good as far as running it over night i cant say,cause i never tried.</font><br><br><br>After reading this post left on the message board describe how to macro EverQuest using physical methods instead of virtual methods, it reminded me of an idea I had quite a few months back.  While my method has never been tested, I cannot think of why it wouldn't work.  As a matter of fact, I was so convinced that this method could work, I was seriously considering marketting my product, once I had a supply of them built up.  Enough of that, though.  Here is the method I thought up.  If this doesn't work, mark it up to experiance.<br><br><I><font color="red">How it would work;<br>This is actually a very simple idea on how to create a very simple macro for any software that could be macro'd with a single button.  My basic idea is to take the circuitry out of a keyboard's box, keeping the cord attached.  Basically just ripping the plastic and keys off.  Now, you may or may not know this, but a keyboard works by completing a circuit when you press down a key, after that circuit is completed, the energy signal is sent out to the computer, and then through all of the computer components, and you eventually see the output on your screen.  Most programs have a function to auto-repeat a key's bound command if that key is held down, however, this is not the case for EverQuest.  So, if you can't do it in software, do it in hardware.  <br><br>After the circuitry of your keyboard is taken out of the plastic, attach your timer relay to complete the circuit of the key you wish, and put it into your project box with the cord hanging out.  Now, once you are in EQ and want to macro, hook your altered keyboard up and take out your other keyboard.  Voila!  Your project should(in theory at least) be auto-repeating the key you chose.</font><br><br><font color="lime">Parts you'll need:<br>1)  Spare keyboard to rip apart.(you can pick any crappy old 5 pin DIN keyboard at a computer show for $5)<br>2)  Small box to place your project in. (buy one at Radio Shack for $5-$15)<br>3)  Here's the tricky part - a timer delay that can complete a circuit.  These are very, very hard to find.  I looked all over for a small, affordable model, and never came up with anything.  However, I'm no electronics wiz, so I really don't know what company could supply this kind of part.</font><br><br><font color="aqua">How to put it all together.<br>#1)  Rip the plastic off of your high quality $5 keyboard.<br>#2)  Attach your timer to the two ends of the key whose circuit you   wish to complete, thus making the key repeat.<br>#3)  Put your project into your lil' box, and close it up, leaving the cord hanging out.<br>#4)  Use as described above.<br></font></I><br><br>Now, the one flaw I could think of this would be that EverQuest might not recognize the new, altered keyboard if it is a different type then the one you booted up with.  For example, if you have a USB or PS/2 keyboard, and try to switch to a 5 pin DIN keyboard(the one with the big connection area), nothing will happen.  If this turns out to be the case, there are two things you could do.  <br>A) Get a different kind of keyboard to rip apart.<br>B) Get an adapter for the cheapie keyboard so that it has the same type of connection as your usual keyboard.<br><br>If any of you electronic wizards out there could please email me about this, I would be grateful.  If somebody decides to use this design to market a product, have fun, and good luck.  All I ask is that you give me credit for the original conception of the idea.  (Like anybody's going to market this...hehe)<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Recently, I received a dupe method that has been around since the begining.  At first, I wasn't going to post this, because I thought it was kind of common knowledge, but after this person posted about this method on the message board, and was flamed and questioned for it, I guess I kind of decided that it may not be so common of knowledge.  This method is very difficult to do purposely, and I'd be willing to go as far as saying that it is nearly impossible.  However, maybe some time you will find a way to utilize this method, which has been reported many a time, and then perhaps you could continue the flow of information back on over to good ol' EverQuest Alert.<br><br><font color="yellow">Well dammit - this happened to me 1.5 weeks ago, and I never said anything about it because I couldn't get it to work again. I vowed never to tell the Dr.Twister site until I figured out how to do it again... I kept trying and trying and trying but I just couldn't get my timing right. The GOOD news is - I remember exactly how it happened so now Im just DESPERATE to see if anyone can successfully do it again.<br>So here goes. Are you ready???<br>- - -<br>Basically, it's all a matter of TIMING.<br><br>A few days ago I was in Misty Thicket training up my newbie (on Bertoxx). I fought a giant wasp, was doing fine when 2 other wasps show up. I died, no big deal. So I'm sitting there, waiting to get back to homebase. I wait and wait... nothing happens. So the game locks up on <br>me and I reboot the machine and try to get back on - then I find that Bertoxx is DOWN. (Just Bertoxx went down, all the other servers were fine).<br><br>After a couple of hours, Bertoxx gets back online and when I log in I was somewhere in the middle of Misty Thicket, alive and with all my stuff. So I go at it again, hunting spiders and orcs. <br><br>After an hour or so, I'm chasing after a goblin when low and behold - MY F*CKING CORPSE IS ON THE GROUND! I'm like, what the f*ck? So I click on it and holy shit - all my shit is on my corpse. I got double of everything I had on man! Items, money, everything that I had when I died.<br><br>Obviously, EQ reset my character to where I was about 5 mins before the crash, but it saved everything that was on the floor at the time OF the crash. Now I'm wondering if this can happen on regular server downtimes.<br><br>I haven't been able to time it just right - because you have to die THE SECOND the server goes down. But remember - it was a server crash that caused the dupe not regular server <br>maintenance. But the question still remains... Can ONLY a crash create that dupe? Or can a regular server downtime do it too? I dont know how many people are willing to kill themselves in hopes they'll time it just right, but shit its worth a try. Maybe if 1,000 people try to do it one person might get it just right...<br><br>Im so pissed because I was playing with my newbie, not my main char who had mithril and other good stuff. (but then again I probably wouldn't have died at that exact time) hehe.<br></font><br>Sent in by Mad Dawgie.<br><br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Well, maybe there is no GM conspiracy, but there is definately something fishy going on with Verant's rules of conduct guidelines.  While I personally condemn kill stealers to a painful, bloody, shameful, long and excruciating death, according to Verant, it <I>is</I> legal, and therefore, should not warrant any ill treatment from GMs for doing so(unless you are breaking another rule while kill stealing, of course).  However, all too often, the line between what is and what is not condoned by the company, and a customer service rep.'s personal feelings about something is blurred, and quite often totally disregarded.  This is the best reason I can think of for why the conduct code for customer service rep.s in online games(and services of all sorts for that matter) should be freely available to any customer who desires it.  Now, I don't think I need to tell you Verant's stance on this.  You saw what they did when Lum released the Guide Manual.  Smedley himself threatened poor Lum with a lawsuit unless it was immediately taken down.  Way to fight for better customer satisfaction, Smelley.<br><br>Now, have said that, take a look at what I received in the mail recently.  While I do not condone kill stealing and over anti-social behaviors personally, it [kill stealing] <I>is</I> within the rules set forth by Verant.  <br><br><font color="yellow">Well It has been a week since I have been suspended from EQ for unapropriate behavior as Verant says.  I am sick and tired of this. I been harassed, played like a fool, ignored, not even notified and baned for something that is legal!<br> <br>Before I begind I would like to say I go to college after that I go to work, I come back home very late and if I get few hours I play EQ.  Now I do not have time to wait 20hours and camp an item, Or I do not have time to go on rotation, as much as I love EQ I try to get things easy way, besides my friends help me a lot.  I was suspended from Everquest for 1 week because I was kill stealing.  I know you will already hate me for that but it is your choice, some of you may say good for you, my response to you is I am only suspended for 1 week so not that big of deal BUT the big of deal I am about to write is how I was treated by Verant and their wonderfull customer support.  <br> <br> <br> <br><br>I play on The Tribunal Server. my problem is this- on Friday I was with my friends killing treants in South Karana for 5hours and then my friends had to leave, so I was all alone and could no handle the treants, I went to the bard in S. Karana and saw some one there, I asked the guy to rotate kills but he refused, I did try to take his kills 3 times but since he was too high level I was unsuccessful, I decided I will go back to treants.  When I arrived I saw a group already there, so I though what the heck, I will KS here.  The guy who was there sad to get lost or I will be in deep trouble since he had contacts with the gods and if I bother him he will make sure to get me baned.  As soon as I attacked a treant a guide came to me and another came in a few seconds. Their names were " Lioran" and "Hattan", right away they started accusing me of harassing all zone and they repeatidly sad I was harassing MANY, that's right MANY people in the zone, when I did not harass anyone at all but just plainly tried to take some kills WHICH IS LEGAL. Anyway the 2guides continued threatening me of how in big trouble I am and that they putting notice that I been harassing all zone. I got rather upset because that was not true, not giving me chance to explain and laughing at me with other players who called the guides they disappeared.  Later the day I called a GM, and told about how rudely  I was treated and I asked GM to check if 2 guides put anything under my record, GM responded saying nothing was put in, so I though those 2 guides just played a joke on threatening me.  Well this is when I was happy and logged off.  Next day I log back in with 2 people giving me tells that GM with name starting with letter V, he was level 49bard has talked to people in Kelethin who were kill stealing to stop because they will get in trouble just like me who is about to get banned.  I was rather upset some one talking about me, especially a GM, right away I messaged that GM who was off, in few hours finally I saw the GM on and messaged him what's the deal and why he is talking to people about me getting banned, the GM responded to me he has not sad such thing and sad I was fine and nothing to worry about. Well I guess that was another lie.  Next day, Sunday I log on in afternoon and get a group with my friends to go kill guards in E. Karana. after few hours not sure if it was GM or guide but I received message from "Ignaurus",   "Greetings, I am here to let you know you have been  suspended from Everquest, have a nice day"  Right away I though it was a prank by one of my enemies and as soon as I tried to respond back I received black screen, SERVER NOT RESPONDED.   I tried to log back in EQ when I got message on log-in "You have been temporarily suspended from Everquest due to inappropriate behavior, please contact tech support for further assistance"  Well I was more than upset.  <br>    <br>    First of all I would like to bring the points of guides being completely rude and getting away with that.  Second of all why I was lied by GMs I was just fine if there was something going on.  Why I was not told to?  Why did Ignaurus kick me from EQ without warning, which my group members told me via ICQ they died because I disappeared and they had no way to kill the guard themselves.  What is this all with this conspiracy?<br>I have not been harassing anyone.  After hard college day, then work I come home when have time to go and do whatever I can.  I am not here to wait for long rotations or camping.  As it was announced that Kill Stealing is in fact LEGAL and even Senior GM, Savanah has confirmed it right to me, why is it always told I am harassing people?  Did I follow THE SAME person all over zone? NO.  I come and KS whoever I see.  That is not harassing same person, that is perfectly legal Kill stealing.  Getting experiance and camping item in EQ is ridiculous, people camp item for up to 3days straight, it is a game it is suposed to give us enjoyment, what kind of enjoyement it is to wait 10hours to get jboots, well now they made it quest but there are many more items needed to camp them. If it spawns and I am there I will kil it while it . Now if was told that KSing is ILLEGAL I would not do that, why would I want to get banned.  <br>As an example I will bring this: Lets say I am smoking in the street and cop comes to me who had bad day and arrests me and puts me in jail for 1 week just cos he was not in good mood.  That is exactly what happened.  Even though it is a game I was suspended for 1 week for something that is legal.  I have NEVER in MY EQ playing time followed a person around a KSed their kills. NEVER.  But if I see a kill I will go for it   <br> <br>How many people have been actually harssed in EQ and people follow them around and GM did nothing?  What is up with this GM favouratism. Where do GM/guides receive their training.<br> <br>Well as for Verant I have notified my brother and my parents of what happened.<br>Not only I got suspended for something that is legal but I got suspended because some GM was in bad mood.  Not only that I was lied to, threatened, ignored, my e-mails have been ignored for past week and I have e-mailed 5GMs and Brad and Mr. Smedley himself.  Do they think this is funny?  I have called tech support and these guys were not helpfull at all.  What is going on?  Is e-mail only comunication?  There is no phone numbers of some one high in charge where you can call and make a complaint?  Is it because of so many calls they would receive?<br>Since I been ignored like this my parents will take legal action against Verant for this total abuse.  My dad is a boss of big company and I know for sure if one of his employess did this kind of service they would be LONG gone out of there.  These guy are getting paid by our money!<br> <br>This is all I have to say.  I am going public with this. </font><br><br>Now, as you probably know, this is not verified by me...Bla bla bla...Don't email me if you know the person and have something good/bad to say about them, cause it won't end up getting posted, and I really hate responding to more mail every day than I have to already.

                Humm lets see what is new in the world of EQ....  Not to much.  New patch went in so about half of the classes out there got a bunch of new armor quests.  Bout time.  Pluss I like how that they all rely on faction.  Oh well here is my rant.  If you dont like it dont read it. <br><br><br><font color="yellow">I admit it.  I have put in some time trying to hack an advantage out of EQ.  Now im no master hacker.  Hell I could hardly call myself a novice.  In fact I have never hacked anything before this.  But I must say it has been a very enlightening experience.  One thing I would like to address is a few things I have found.  One of the first oddities I discoverd was the graphics files.  Why is every skin duplicated?  Graphics take up a lot of space and to have 2 of everything seems odd.  Not only that but the skin for the MOB Cazic Thule is in every zone.  I mean if your gonna have a universal mob why not put it in the global file???  Having the skin for one mob down some 30 odd times seems a bit wastefull if you ask me.  Then there are some totaly redundant files.  There is one text file that welcomes me to Phase4 beta and has instructions on how to revive a character from a previous phase.  The best of course is the file called 989news.txt which contains only "deleteme".  Now there are a few funny oddites out there like the Ultra Death Spell.  This spell basicaly a note to wanabee hackers from the developers.  Course the spell Can'o Whoop Ass is a hoot to.  "You open up a can'o whoop ass."  "Your can is empty".  I would love to know what mob or item that casts that spell.  I don't know but I remember when developers had to take file sizes into account when makeing a game.  If they had gone back and removed all the unused and outdated files/notes and not doubled EVERY single graphic and others dozens of times.  Also there were graphics for things that were clearly like Pre Alpha.  I found this one pic that looks like a roll of toilet paper that has a slide bar for how much you want.  This looks like it came right out of UO.  As far as hacking goes I have come across very little that works 100%.  Right now though I have some theories but I am in the process of building levels so that I may test them out.  As far as Hacking... Its not all that hard.  I was suprised at how easy it was.  Course getting stuf to work is not easy.  I have looked at eqgame disasembled and tried a few things.  One project was to be able to cast spells while moveing.  Farthest I managed to get was the full animation of casting but it was still uncast.  I have hacked spells but that does no good.  When you send a request for a spell everything is done serverside and you are sent the results.  The eqspell.dat file is nothing more than a tool for the client to use for prediction to make EQ appear lag free.  In fact thats just about what every file in EQ is for.  Movement is client side but all my attempts at finding the coordinates have failed.  And I am tired of trying to find them.  I guess the best you can hope for is to spend some cash and buy your self something off of E-bay and twink like crazy.  Either that or wait for an emulator and then play solo.... but that defeats the whole purpose of the game.  For me I would like to see more quests.  I think verant is headed in the right direction. But I still think that they lack major suport for mid levels.  Like levels 15-35.  Some of the requirements of these new armor quests are unreal.  Like killing Named sand giants and the like.  Joy.  There seems to be this long stagnant stretch of levels when nothing is done and then POW its like being a newbie all over again.  High level armor quests.  Elemental plane of Fear ect...  Hopefully the expansion set will add a lot.  Personaly I think they should redo the levels.  Put the max up there like around 100 or so.  I dont like being forced to fight in a group to fight blues for survival and then only receive 1/3 of a bub of exp in 4 hours of play.  There should be tramendous bonuses for fighting in groups.  Either that or give everyone the amount of exp as they would have if they had soloed the mob.  Now there would be a reason to group other than sheer imposibility of soloing after a while.</font><br><br>-Stormlord</blockquote><br>

He searched about 2 hours unsuccessfully finding it then gave up and started playing his other characters. What he didn't know is that your corpses disappear after 24 hours of account activity. So if you play any character for more than 24 hours without recovering your characters corpse it goes poof.

                Well here is the Official "Enchancement" Listing for EQ today.<br><br>Well Rubicite no longer spawns and now is probably worth a ton. Expect to see Ebay auctioners offering full suits or simply pieces of Rubi for outrageous prices. (I really wish Verant would stop these auctions).<br><br>Now then lets go forth and get the information on the new Class Specific Armor Quests!<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>October 13th, 7:00am<br>--------------------<br>We are excited to announce the implementation of the new "Optional" patch system. This new system will allow players to download new optional files such as zones, music, character animations, etc. After the EverQuest executable is run (everquest.exe), and once the download is complete, you will receive an option to patch the "optional" files. If "Yes" is selected, the optional files will begin downloading, if "No" is selected, you will bypass the optional files and continue. Please note that this optional patch requestor will appear every time everquest.exe is run. <br><br>In addition to the optional patch program, the following changes and enhancements have been made: <br><br>*Optional Patch* <br><br>A new zone, The Temple of Solusek Ro, is now available via the optional patch. <br><br>*General Enhancements* <br><br>- Experience and looting rights are now awarded for group aggregate damage. This is now true for ALL servers. We still consider this change in 'TEST' and will conduct a poll as to whether it positively addresses the kill stealing situation in approximately 2 weeks.<br><br>- As mentioned on Saturday, Rubicite armor will no longer spawn. The new class specific quests to obtain the new armor are now in for each class that could wear Rubicite.<br><br>- Journeyman's Boots will no longer spawn where they did but rather are the products of a quest.<br><br>- To address trade fraud (players removing items/money immediately prior to trading to deceive the other player), items/money may only be removed by clicking on the "Cancel" button. - When receiving a text message from either an NPC or PC speaking in a language other than "Common Tongue", if the user's language skill is high enough, the language being spoken will be noted preceding the text.<br><br>- The fishing pole will now appear in the player's hand whenever the fishing skill is used.<br><br>- A number of quests were both added and enhanced throughout the zones. <br><br>*Trade Skills* <br><br>A number of new items have been added to Blacksmithing. <br><br>*Spell Enhancements* <br><br>- Some of the Items that Magicians Summon with their spells have been made better / had their effects increased.<br><br>- Fufil's Curtailing Chant, Tuyen's Chant of Flame and Tuyen's Chant of Frost (BARD) have all had their effects slightly increased.<br><br>- The Burnout Series (Magicians) has had the negative HP component reduced (improvement) and the stat buff increased (improvement). Because of this, the spells are no longer permanent - they now have a 15 minute duration. Burnout III has also had its casting cost reduced.<br><br>- Illusion: Werewolf attack speed component now works as intended.<br><br>- Insipid Weakness (Enchanter) will research as intended. <br><br>- The EverQuest Team </font></blockquote><br>

                Lately(like since April) I really don't know whether I should praise Verant for their quick work of fixing "bugs", or throw a tantrum at them for "enhancing" something that didn't need to be "enhanced".  One more useful ability supposedly down the drain as of late; namely, the ability to effectively "alt+tab" out of EverQuest.  I have no way to confirm this, since the harddrive/partition EverQuest was on is now housing software of a different nature, so if some of you could email me and tell me your results as of late, I would be greatly obliged.<br><br>Now, Verant, instead of hindering our ability to do something constructive while we have EverQuest loaded, why not simply further safeguard your program?  Disabling one's ability to alt+tab out of an application should never ever ever <I>ever</I> be considered adequate security for protecting the application's vulnerable, client side memory locations from being viewed.  Now, I know little C++, and the extint of my knowledge in the field of puting together games, especially MMO games, is next to zero, but even <I>I</I> know that if not being able to multitask out of the program is considered one of the program's more valued security features, there are going to be some security problems.  If somebody out there <I>really</I> wants to view the memory addresses and do searches for them, etc, they are going to do it; whether or not they can alt+tab out of EverQuest.  There are ways around it(ie; networking two computers via a program like Timbuktu, PC Anywhere, or even NetBus), and anybody who really wants at what is stored in memory, will be able to see what they want.  Why not give us players a break and let us read a news article while we are waiting 20 minutes to get our warrior's HP back, or look at a map while we are just learning Neriak.<br><br>-Baggle<br></blockquote><br>

                <br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><blockquote>
                As I'm sure the vast majority of you know, EverQuest is a very hot topic on eBay.  Hundreds of transactions are made over eBay each week regarding EverQuest, and millions of dollars have been made doing so. Of course, honest people aren't the only ones out there looking to make a quick buck by selling stuff over eBay.  There are scammers as well.  I suppose it had to come about sooner or later, but it's just too bad that it ever really did have to come about.  <br><br>Recently, I was looking over eBay just to see how much things were going for these days.  As I was looking around at EverQuest items, I saw a description for an item, "EverQuest account".  The big was $200, so I checked it out.  My mouth dropped when I looked at what was being bid on.  An account with a level 45 and a level 46 character with a full set of rubicite, and all of the other trimmings.  I immediately looked at when the auction would end, with thoughts of huge amounts of profit racing through my mind about how much I could resell this for if I bought it.  Quite an investment.  To my dismay, the auction had ended three hours before I looked at it, and it had sold for $200 to a bidder named tinydragon.  <br><br>All hope was not lost, however.  I still had the meager chance of hoping the highest bidder was extremely stupid, and would sell it to me for $300 or so, so I could still make a huge profit.  So, I emailed him.  Soon after, I received a response.  He would not sell the account to me, as it was too good of a deal to pass up.  I emailed him back, thanking him for responding, and wishing him luck.  A few days later, I received another email from him.  Appearantly, it was a scam.  After the person sent off the money, he received an account with two characters on it.  However, they were level 1, and had no items on them.  The scamee also sent me an email saying that this person is selling more things regarding EverQuest on eBay, and to beware.  So, I am passing this on to you.  While I no longer have the email I received with his warning, telling me the scammer's name and item numbers, I can give you a few tips for making eBay a little safter.<br><br>1)  If you are dealing with a lot of money(or even a little money), and don't want to be scammed,  you can contact a third party to negotiate the items between the buyer and the seller.  eBay has listings of the companies that do such things on their web page.<br><br>2)  Ask for screenshots!  In the screenshots, ask the person to do something specific.  Type your name into the text box, for example, when they take the screenshot with the item/character/etc.  While screenshots <I>can</I> be faked, it is a pain in the arse, and most people will not have the will to do so.  To make it even safter, ask them to have the see-through text screen activated when they speak.  It'd be much harder to fake that, than it would be to fake a solid color background.<br><br>3)  Use Western Union.  It can be expensive(around 10% of the amount you are sending), but if you are investing your money in a deal like this, with somebody you don't know, it is better to be safe and happy, than sorry, and uhh, sorry.  If you are buying an account, and using Western Union, you can send the money to somebody, but not tell them the confirmation number of the money(the number they give to the office so they can pick up the money) until you receive the account information.  There is a 1-800 number you can call, where you enter your phone number, and it will tell you if you have money waiting for you at Western Union or not.  After you have confirmed that the money is waiting for you, you can give the person the account information, and they can then send you the confirmation number for the money.  While this does have its flaws, it is one of the safest, and people are much more easily tracked this way, since you have to give a thumbprint, valid ID, and your address/phone when you make out a Western Union or pick one up.<br><br>4)  The easiest, and possibly one of the most effective ways to not be scammed - get the other person's phone number, and call them!  It is much, much easier to get a read off of somebody by talking to them over the phone than it is to get a read off of them via email.  Also, unless the person is a professional at this sort of thing(and most aren't), then it's going to be much harder for them to bullshit you over the phone than it will be over the internet.<br><br>I hope some of you get some use out of this.  If there is one thing I can't stand, it has to be scammers, liars, and all around a-holes.  Keep your eyes open, and, as the person who was scammed said to me, "If it seems too good to be true, it probably is."<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                <font color="red"><I> WARNING!<br></font><font color="yellow">  Rant ahead!  Proceed with extreme caution!</font></I><br><br>Well, appearantly, Mirabilis(recently bought by AOL), creators of ICQ, believe the answer to this question is no.  I've had to find this out the hard way lately, since I've been trying to do my part for the small time(well, smaller than Microsoft) OS/OS plugin developers of the world.  Needless to say, I decided to ditch Windows for the most part, and go with Linux. <br><br>So, Friday night, I grabbed my copy of RedHat6.1(RedHat now supports TNT2.  Yay), changed my BIOS to boot from CDROM, and loaded it up.  After getting everything installed, and creating my accounts, of course the first thing I'm going to want to do is get on the internet and load up ICQ.  I get the dialer set up no problem, so I get onto Netscape and head on over to <a href="http://www.mirabilis.com">http://www.mirabilis.com</a> to get ICQ for Linux.  I get to the page, go to ICQ for Linux downloads.  The so called "ICQ for Linux" is simply a Java version of the client, which doesn't even include all of the features.  Oh well.  Better than nothing I suppose.  So I download the latest JDK version(jdk1.1.7) for Linux, since the site says ICQJava will be compatable with 1.1.4 and above.  It's 20MB, but I suck it up.  No big deal.  I just play Smiletris and Konquest for an hour.<br><br>An hour passes.  Then file has finished downloading.  I'm happy.  Now, it's time to download the small ICQJava file.  So, I download it, I install it, I get it running, and I'm ready to talk to my friends via ICQ.  Not so fast, Baggle boy!  At the registration screen, it crashes when I try to enter my password for my existing UIN.  "That's strange..." I think to myself, as I try it again.  Same thing.  I repeat this process, ohhh, six thousand times, and at about the 5,998th time, I start to suspect there is a problem.<br><br>At this point, I head back over to the ICQ web site to search message boards.  After <I>much</I> searching through a badly designed website(although not as badly designed as it was back in '96/'97), I come to find that, as a matter of fact, jdk1.1.7, which they claim would work with their ICQJava, does not!  I will need to download an earlier version.  Goodie.  Now I get to download 10MB.  I suck it up again, and I download the file, and redefine my settings in ICQJava to point to the new java controller I just downloaded, get to the registration screen, and I don't freeze on the password dialog!  Yes,   I finally got it working!  So, I fill out my UIN, and my password on the "Use existing UIN" screen, bypass the surveys, and connect to ICQ servers.  "Registration failed.  Try again."  I try again, and get the same message.  Sooner or later, I end up looking at my internet stats for before and after I press the "Submit" button.  I'm not sending out any packets to the ICQ servers.  Great.  Time again to visit the message boards.<br><br>So, I start up Netscape again, and I head back over to the ICQ website to check out the message boards.  After <I>much, much, MUCH</I> searching, I find out that if you have a dynamic IP address(which means it changes every time you log on to your ISP, which 99% of the computer using people in the USA have), you have to edit a file to point to your new IP address <I>every time</I> you want to connect.  What's even better, they didn't say which file, or what line to edit!<br><br>At this point, I'm pretty fed up.  Nevertheless, I still want to get ICQ working in Linux.  So, I head on over to dogpile.com to do a search for "running ICQ in linux", I believe the exact search was, and submit it, hoping that somebody has faced the same problems I have faced today.  Page after unrelated to my search page shows up, and things are looking bleak.  Then, something miraculous happened.<br><br>This story does end in a happy ending, however, which I know all of you want for your favorite person in the world - me.  As I was just about ready to give up, and ask all of my friends to constantly be on IRC, I found a page which changed everything - <a href="http://licq.wibble.net">LICQ</a>.  LICQ is a Linux "clone" of ICQ, which was based on the original source of ICQ.  It works exactly like ICQ, except it was written in C++, and not Java, which means it will run much faster and with less errors.  You enter your existing ICQ number and password, and it connects you to the real ICQ servers.  It is ICQ in a rewritten client, made specifically for Linux users!  You can add other ICQ users to your online list, and do everything you can do in Mirabilis' version of ICQ(and some things you can't), but in Linux, without the hard to use interface and errors of the Java version.  I immediately downloaded this program and started running it.  Breaking the stride of the day, it ran flawlessly, and it still is - right at this very moment.  It's funny that a single programmer can write a better version of a program, than a whole team of Mirabilis' programmers can.  <br><br>I guess this just goes to show that more money anda  bigger team doesn't necessarily equal better product.  Look at UOExtreme, for example.  One person wrote a better client for the game than the well funded, well stocked, well trained team that was working on the game could.  Take this for what it is, but when emulators and whole new clients for EQ come rolling around, keep this in mind, Verant.  Especially you, Mr. Smelly, err, Smedley.<br><br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                <font color="aqua">Well I must first say that from all the people that I have talked to that Everquest is one of THE hardest games to hack.  Why is this?  Simple.  Everything in the game is always being checked and rechecked.  In fact the game does a check just about every 2 seconds.  In the last few weeks I have been hammering at EQ very hard.  Quite frankly in my opinion most of the files are just ploys.  Sure you have all the spells on file and all the items.  All these files are used for is client side prediction.  Thats right.  Everything the client does is fake.  This is done to avoid the appearance of lagg.  For thoes of you that played UO and came to EQ will know what im talking about.  Lagg free EQ is a godsend compared to UO.  Also I hate to disapoint you but I would not get my hopes up about any killer hacks.  Everything that has to do with spells, items, and stats are all handled serverside.  This leaves very little to exploit.  Right now I would say that messing with Items would be the most dangerous.  EQ has a nasty habbit of droping you when your items dont match what the server says you should have.  Not only that it sends emails and you end up on a nasty little list.  Spells are a bit safer.  You can mess with them all you want but EQ doesnt give a rats arse what your spells say they do.  When you cast a spell the server does all the work and sends you the results.  You can tell your client that minor sheilding is suposed to give you 500ac but you wont get it.  As far as Stats go... its fairly the same thing with spells.  I had a lev1 cleric with 600ac but I still took the same dammage from MOB's and just as often.  Its just a display value nothing more.  The real numbers are all serverside.  So for thoes of you waiting for an EQPlugin or EQExtreem dont get your hopes up for some allpowerfull utilites.  The only thing I can come up with now is testing packets.  Unfortunatly I know very little about that and all testing I have done with it has come up nill.  Right now I hope that they can at least give Humans Ultravision.  My monk has been blind for long enough.</font><br><br>Stormlord.  Blue because its bum news.</blockquote><br>

                Although appropriately for our messageboard it is quite likely NOT the type of Camera they want to be on. However for the DTN this is the exact kind of "Camera" we are wanting to be under. DTN's policy has been to publish known bugs to the community for your protection and to alert the game(s) companies of issues with their product and for them to fix. That is of course why so many dupe bugs go unpublished, why? Because the Xsploiters do not wish us to release the information to the companies or to the community for their own protection.<br><br>A user submitted this, of course as you can see he dug it up on EQRants.<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>Found this on EQ Rants:<br> <br>And John Smedley's response:<br><br>I'll happily respond to your email. <br><br>  Some comments: <br><br>  * We scan most websites on a Daily basis. Brad and the Dev team are all over the place responding to posts on different fan sites AND responding to the hundreds of emails we each get every day. We do look at your website as well, and many other sites that don't always have flattering things to say. The bottom line to us is that it's still a site that carries EQ information, so we are interested. Heck, I go to Dr. Twister every day (although for slightly different reasons ;) ) I would like to point out the access that ALL players have to our Dev Team. We don't keep them locked up, just the opposite... we encourage them to answer people's direct questions. For example, Geoff Zatkin, the Magic Man spends a lot of time answering questions on different mailing lists. <br><br>  * We're doing our level best right now to hire even more GM's and get a lot more Guides on board. It's hard for people to get a sense of just how tough it is dealing with Hundred's of thousands of people. <br><br>  * You should notice one major thing.. We do a lot of polling to get people's opinions on things. We then take direct action based on the results of that poll. I'm not sure how much more direct we could possibly be than that. Recently looting rules were modified based on the results that poll. We also did a poll on Customer Service recently (which actually told us that most people were pretty satisfied with our Customer Service). The purpose of that poll wasn't to pat ourselves on the back... just the opposite, we want to find out where our problem areas are and shore them up. Bottom Line: You are our customers and we're here to provide an entertaining experience for all of you. <br><br>* We don't feel like you are another $10.00 in our pockets. It's strange to me that people sometimes have that opinion.. because it simply isn't the case, OR maybe it is, but I would put it as "You are IMPORTANT to us because you are another $10.00 in our pockets". We know where our paychecks come from, believe me. <br><br>Hope this answers at least some of your questions. <br><br>Thanks, <br><br>John Smedley<br>President and CEO<br>Verant Interactive, Inc<br></font></blockquote><br>

                Well I received an immediate response to my requests for Zone Bugs and it appears that the Karana's are some of the most notorious, having not one, not two, but four different zoning bugs although most of them take you to the same place they still are all slightly different, Enjoy!<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>Ok, I know of two zone warps.  I have never died doing these.<br><br>Zone into West Karana from North Karana along the south shore.  At the first tree (IMMEDIATELY after zoning) turn south.  Swim out until you can't anymore.  Swim down to the bottom, then back to zone.  You will pop out at the crossroads by Tower 1.  A great way to save an annoying long run.<br><br>The other is in East Karana.  Zone in from North Karana.  Situate yourself underneath the bridge (I usually do this while still on land).  Turn towards the North Karana zone.  Swim towards the zone line, and hug the bottom of the river.  You will pop out at the bottom of the mountain pass to Highpass Hold.  This is a GREAT way for newbies to get to Freeport, as they bypass all the hostile nasties here.</font><br><br>Wow, what do we have here? Another Zone bug in the Karanas.<br><br><FONT COLOR="YELLOW"><br>Actually, you can do this in the Karana's, too. If going from east to west, Hug the zone line, and stay as far north as possible. Turn right at about a 45 degree angle. Fall of the edge and BAM, right in front of the quenos hills entrance. If going from West to east, hug the northern zone line, and head east. Once you zone into north Karana, headnorth, and walk across the top of the zone untill you reach the river(stay out of the water, you'll fall through). then you can either A: Goaround the back of the bridge that's the zone , or b: run down the'correct' side of the zone until you reach the bridge, and dash in. Falling through this zone isn't quite As safe, since it can drop you ona HG, or griff, and there are no guards in sight.<br></FONT><br><br>Yet another Zone bug in North K :)<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>Here is about the best zone BUG for people who travel to Qeynos alot, If you gate to North K alot like me when you want to do this bug just goto the stone briage well your in North K hang a right and follow the water you will zone into East K and we all know that Qeynos Hills is a LONG walk from the North K zone so just jump into the water and zone well your in the water WOW look at that your about 30 secs to Qeynos Hills.<br></font></blockquote><br>

                This was a rant that was sent in to Verant customer support, and later posted on our message board.  This wasn't written by me, nor do I support everything said within it.  As a matter of fact, I feel different about a lot of things than this person does.  <I>HOWEVER</I>, this is a damn fine rant, and I appriciate anybody who can put this much, well, err, ranting, into a rant.  Even though I don't agree with everything, the writer brings up some good points.  Check it out.<br><br><font color="yellow">Verant,<br>It's now October 4th, 1 month after I sent the e-mail quoted below. None of the points I spoke to have been alleviated and new problems and frustrations have been introduced. Due to your neglect of player enjoyment, I have cancelled my account and vow never to do business with Verant, any future subsidiaries, or parties thereof. Wherever any name associated with Verant appears, I will not purchase or act as a patron of that party. Wherever Verant is mentioned, I will depict the company and it's personnel as unresponsive, neglectful, and not worth doing business with as has been my unfortunate experience. You have completely and totally alienated this gamer. Even worse, you've infuriated him and made him utterly despise your company.<br><br>To each point from my original message, quoted after these follow-up comments:<br><br>1. Overcrowding has not been solved. In fact, it has gotten worse with player volume per server rising to over 1500 at peak (indication that perhaps your player base is growing, but you're breeding a lot of discontented short-timers)<br><br>2. Nerfing of skills and spells. The systematic reduction, in no logical fashion, of all skills and spells in the name of "balance" has utterly ruined the enjoyment of most races and classes. What joy is there in waiting 15 minutes for mana to return as a caster. Seeing most spells resisted more often than they succeed. Having enemies teleport out of nowhere directly on top of you if you're in a "safe" zone and don't even know what the hell a safe zone is (later described to me by a savvy exploiter player)<br><br>3. Camping is beyond excruciating. Waiting for a week in queue is not my idea of fun, nor will I ever do it. You failed to implement any reasonable solution in a timely manner, and this so-called "Yield" rule you're planning to enact without a stitch of code to support it has no prayer of being enforced by Guides who already take 8 hrs to respond to even the most urgent petitions (/petition I've been stuck in a wall due to a bug for 8 hrs now and have petitioned 5 times. Only once did I receive a reply and I was told to "politely wait"...6 hrs ago...get me out please, my patience is more than exhausted and I want to play the game I'm paying for...)<br><br>4. Spawn rates are abysmal. Worthwhile enemies show so rarely it's laughable. When they do, they barely ever yield any loot. Worst of all is the decrease of all normal, non-unique items, on most mobs. Where the hell did spider silk go now that it has a use? Why in the hell can't I find a single bone chip in 20 skeleton kills. That kind of obscene forcing of repetition gets one response from me. One finger right at you, and it isn't my pinky I assure you.<br><br>5. Good gosh people. Before you go off and code some tricky little 2/3,same,1+ dmg routine for DoTs that everyone vehemently curses you for and didn't want, how about fixing your damn quests? It's bad enough that we can't adventure and kill much anymore, but to leave the only other RP-ish avenue of gaining some experience broken left and right is intolerable.<br><br>6. Your faction system is amusing. I haven't the time or patience to kill 3000 orc pawns to be tolerated in a city. I have better things to do with my time.<br><br>7. Recent changes push me inexorably toward the vile time-sink known as grouping. See below for reasons I dislike that avenue of gaming except for specific objectives. Due to items #1-4 it's even more distasteful than before. "No I want the spider silk!" "No I get it!" "Hell no, me"<br>me--> "Umm, friends, let's just take turns as we agreed? I know we've killed 30 giant spiders and this is the first silk we've seen in hours, but do we have to degenerate to such squabbling!" All--> "Screw you, I need it for cured silk armor, it's mine!" me--> "Sigh..."<br><br>8. Crowding, latency due to such, camping, and difficulty finding group-based areas where the two factors aren't a huge problem is nigh impossible. Hmm, let's hunt in West Commons (80 players), Oasis (80), South Karanas (60)... oh c'mon, this is stupid, I'm going to bed.<br><br>9. Player run economy? Great, the enchanters who rotate the Moggok Stein quest and sell it for 1000pp to other players who have cheated/duped/etc. can buy a single Oracle Robe for 4500pp a pop. Me, well heck, after 1 week of killing wisps for greater lightstones every night I've just barely saved up enough after buying spells to afford an 150pp dragoon dirk. Woop-dee-doo... how utterly distasteful and dissatisfying.<br><br>10. 8 chars per server...Puh-lease. Twink, twink, twink. X tells the Guild, "Hey guys, brb, I'm gonna suicide and consent my mule so I can finish a quest with their faction. Hey, can someone dupe me their Rubicite while I'm away? I lost mine due to a bug wiping my corpse out after that latest "enhancement" patch to prevent cheating. Snicker, thanks."<br><br>Out of patience,<br>*real name deleted*<br></font><br><br>*reels back in awe*<br><br>Credit for this goes out to Wildcat of the message board.  NICE rant!<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

However, I have also heard that it is server specific(when the new servers were coming out, I was hearing rumors along these lines, and that there were a lot of these spots on the new servers), so, if it doesn't work on <I>your</I> server, that doesn't <I>have</I> to mean that it doesn't work at all.

Pos.1150  Neg.32.....wait a while if no rat, snake or occasional pup is there....once something appears, kill it....something else immediately pops up.  An infinite quick respawn point, and where Fippy and some of his other gang pop up from time to time.  Great for a newbie needing money just get a Newbie, a high lvl friend that can kill most little guys in one hit, and group...The high lvl can whack while the little guy (also with 8 backpacks in his inv.) can loot...much quicker than the Troll shadownight trick, Ive made 10pp in 20 mins there...It all depends on how fast you can whack, loot, and make a store run.</font><br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Here is some more information on the corpse duping possibilities.  Take this for what it's worth.  As the writer points it, it could be a bug which has some very specific requirements to reproduce.<br><br><font color="yellow">Alright. I just now was referred to this board by a friend of mine, and was baffled <br>to see my exact same story online! Basically, one of those often times the <br>server came down, I was (un)lucky enough to be in Crushbone. When I got <br>back online, of course, everything was respawned and I was in the slaver room. <br>Within about 5 seconds, dead. So, I am bound in kelethin, and I go into CB <br>again. Die again, right near my corpse. Go back in, die up on some rocks. <br>When I come back, I do the /corpse command, and it tells me I am too far <br>away from all 3 corpses, so that's all cool and everything. I find my 2 corpses, <br>start pulling what I thought would be both, and go to the entrance. I loot the first <br>corpse, because I though that IT was my original corpse. Later that day, I went <br>in to camp the slaver, and lo and behold! I saw my corpse, which, from the <br>outside had nothing, but I figured I'd let the server destroy it. I loot it, and there, <br>right in front of me, I have ALL of my original items duped. I don't know if it was <br>having the 2 corpses in the same zone and zoning in, trying to pull both, or <br>what. But I haven't managed to dupe it again yet. <br><br>MY THOUGHTS ON WHY IT MIGHT WORK:<br>1) Having 3 corpses in the same zone, and enough other creatures that the <br>server tries to use as few items as possible. It uses the first corpse to define <br>the 2nd and 3rd.<br>2) Having 2 corpses in the same zone, lots of objects, and zoning into and out <br>of the zone with a full body. <br>3) Trying to pull 2 corpses at the same time to the zone border<br>4) Any combination of the above. It may be a VERY time,item, level, etc <br>specific bug.<br>ps: I was level 5 when this happened. <br></font><br><br>If you have any other ideas about this, please send them in.  If it is even remotely plausible or even if it's not, and it is just well written, it will probably get posted.  Soo, think on this, and check it out.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Okay guys, now I have personally confirmed this one.  It works.  It works, and I love it.  Because of this lil' trick, I successfully navigated Neriak with my newbie Necromancer yesterday(Paladin was getting pretty boring).  This can be kind of buggy, but it is pretty darned simple, and it works.  Great for looking at web sites for maps(PLUG - <a href="http://everquest.gamestats.com">AllaKhazam's Magical Realm</a>) while you are actually playing, instead of trying to just memorize where you need to go, or printing the map out.  Anyhow, on to the instructions.<br><br>1)  While in EverQuest, click on the "Options" button in the upper left hand corner in the graphics mode with the game window in the middle of the screen.<br><br>2)  Click on "Display", then, find the text that says "Same screens resolution"  "ON/OFF".  Make sure it is off.<br><br>3)  Get back into the game mode of it, and press alt+tab.<br><br>4)  You should now be at your desktop, with EverQuest minimized in the task bar.  Press ctrl+alt+del <I>ONCE</I>.<br><br>5)  Click outside of the "Close Program" window, on the desk top.<br><br>6)  Press the "Cancel" button on the window.<br><br>Okay.  You are now out of EverQuest and can do anything you want with your computer.  Your mouse should be working, and you should have full control over your keyboard as well.  When you want to get back into the game, do the following...<br><br>1)  Click on the EverQuest box on the task bar.<br>2)  Press F10 a few times.  You should now be back in EverQuest.<br><br>Well that was simple.  Like I said, it can get a little buggy when you run other programs behind it, then get back into EverQuest, but, it works.<br><br>Credit for this goes to Loathar of the Dr TwisTer's EQ Alert message board.

I know that somebody either sent this email to me or posted it on the message board a long time ago, but I don't believe I ever got around to posted it here.  This isn't a bug or an exploit, but it is a pretty darn cool command.  You know that you just sound like an idiot when you /shout "Help!!", right?  I know none of you ever really feel like shouting a long message while you have 30 seconds to live.  Well, this command could help.  If you are ever in trouble, simply type "/yell"(without the quotes...), with nothing after it, and it will send a message to those around you in the zone telling them that you need help and you are in a certain direction from it.

                See, someone else has had this same "issue", and I can tell you what there is nothing like going from West Commonts to East Commons then bam 20 seconds later you're almost to the otherside of the zone. It's absolutely wonderful, here's his account of this "bug".<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>Here's another detailing of the bug:<br><br>If you zone from Commons to East Commons at the extreme north end of<br>Commons, by the wall (IE run past the derv camp and skels on the top of the wall and zone).  You will appear extremely high up in E Commons, along the North Wall (IE side of Neriek).   If you turn so you face straight north, towards the wall and go straight up the wall, you can climb over the edge and fall off. This only works if you zone INTO E Commons at the extreme north point on the wall, and will NOT work if you just run along the north wall in E Commons towards Commons.<br><br>So far I've done it about 20 times, not recently, and have never died due to it, and always appear about 20 secs from West Freeport in a nice safe area.<br><br>This works every time unless you're a moron and can't climb in a straight line. Also, I heard a rumor that this happened all the time in beta, and worked on quite a few different zones, and know this has been a bug since the beginning of Phase 4... ... so who knows, may exist on some other zones as well.<br></font><br><br>Here is an email detailing about another "Falling Point" within ButcherBlock right after zoning in from the boat. Shame you can't always survive.<br><br><font color="yellow"><br>Be very carefull falling through the world. There is a place you can do it when you are riding the boat to Butcher. As soon as the boat zones to butcher jump off the left side and swim straight down. You will swim right under the zone. It looks like you are going warp 6 if it is raining. Eventually you would get a free ride to the front of the dwarf city. I did this many many times. Eventally one of my guild members wanted to go to Butcher so I was going to show him this free ride, but as Murphy's Law would have it we fell to our death infront of the city. My friend was not very happy and neither was I. <br><br>I did sucessfully cast spells while "falling". I did cast bind and it said "you feel bound to the area". I was very scared when I died from falling because I had bound to the place I fell from. I did not return to my bind point in the sky, I returned to my previous bind point in Freeport. Feel free to post this if it will save the lives of many.<br></font><br><br>So if you have anymore "Falling Point" / Free Zone Ride bugs go ahead and send them in I'm trying to find the easiest way to cross a zone. Hell if you can find one between The GFay Entrance and the BB Docks I'd love you to death. Everytime I goto catch the boat, just as I zone in I hear ****** shouts, "The Boat!".</blockquote><br>

                I've done it and I'm sure many have, I even found a way to duplicate it repeatedly. After running out of Kithicor Forest back to Freeport, I went through the West Commonlands without a problem, then to the East Commonlands this entire time staying on the left zone wall (left to me going towards freeport) And suddenly I noticed the mountain range top getting very close, then I see myself falling and the "Hall of Mirrors" effect. Suddenly I get the message that I'm falling through the world and returning to a safe point. Well the safepoint is in the Newbie Zone near the Inn. Wow I just got a free ride almost all the way across the zone, and no damage taken. So all I can say is until this gets fixed I've got a free ride nearly all the way across the zone!!

If you don't do this, it simply will not work.  Now, some AGP cards may be different, but this is a positive thing for the v770.
