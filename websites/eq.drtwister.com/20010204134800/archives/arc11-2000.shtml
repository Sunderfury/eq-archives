                As verant sets some sort of guiness record for the most patches in the last 12 days ( maybe who knows what guiness records )the mad dash to grab SoV increases and the frenzy builds . FOr those of you who dont know why people are DASHING as opposed to taking thier time its because,as one guy put it lastnight " OMG,all the good items gonna be nerfed and fixed before i get my damn copy!!".<br>A lot of people are going nuts to get SoV so they can gobble up loot prior to any future fixes. Most items that prove to be over powered are usually fixed in the 1st 2 weeks. SOme last many weeks even months before being altered, but most dont last 2 weeks without being altered. SO hence the mad dash for SoV as well as the unschedualed patches that we are getting now and will continue to get for the next few weeks.<br>My 2 cents ? Verant needs to find xsploiters to test these games/expansions prior to release. Not Goody goody RPers or some tech or GM. Let people who live to cheat play em and im sure they will find more uses for stuff that they would ever think =)<b><br>OH<br>I rarely explain myself unless people get too confused.<br>The post about Stephan King,since some people are too stupid to understand a joke,was concerning the person who hit Stephan King with a car a few months back. That person over-dosed on phenolbarbitol yesterday.<br>Some guy attacked me in an email over it,since he had NO clue what i was talking about,said i was reffering to a black noble peace prize winner who had died of old age last week. Hmm..glad he told me what i was talkin about, i sure was clueless and cowering in the dark until he enlightened me.Alrighty then.</b><br>Ok im gonna go play a bit,then goto work......Oh Congrats to <a href="http://www.tmo.wildfun.com">TMO</a> of Fennin Ro, i think they just killed Trak for the 24th time.</blockquote><br>
