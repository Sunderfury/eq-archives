People think i do because of what i post =)<br> Wanna know what i did ? I tested this bug,then i allowed a necro to sacrafice me last in the day =)<br>Checks and balances baby. You dont think i take the same risk that the actual cheaters do ? Sheet yes i do, i take more of a chance, i dont hide who i am, verant knows who my chars are.<br> So those of you who would rather EQ be a bug filled UO-esque game, please keep cheating and maybe someday you might get your wish....but that will be the day me and people like me,those who play the game for fun and questing,will move on to the next game.<br> <br> *Steps off of his podium"</blockquote><br>

                Running like mad, desperate to live,imad a break for the Cobalt Scar portal.<br> Lo and behold i was charmed as i fell into the water.<br> As i was charmed and unable to climb out fo the pool since it had high walls i ran in circles charmed inside the pool. Insight hit me...none fo the 20 or so mobs ,trying to pillage yours truely, had elected to hit me in some 10 seconds.<br> As charm wore off i peeked over the rim of the pool and noticed a very "Guk-Like"scene.<br> Many of you may remember in the scyrers room in Lguk you used to be able to escape death by diving into the pool. Well it seems the same thing is true at the Dragon portal statue to Cobalt scar in Sky Shrine. After a brief period of mana recoup i comenced to test this theory.<br> Zap a guard from the lip and step back into the pool. Same results. As i was in a hurry i neglected to tes this with DMF, whereas determining if the whol area enclosed by the pools rim was safe. So someone test it for me and email me. <br>Simply have DMF or Levitation on,pull a mob and staep back while floating. If you get bum rushed run out of the pool till the mobs come out and then run back in and dive under water. I do,however,think it will work as well with levitation.<br> Best of luck.<br> Fix this one verant =) Nothing like the thought of 1-2 necros wiping out every mob, that can be pulled to the pool, in sky shrine =)<br></blockquote><br>
