I'm a level 32 bard and he is a 40 shaman. I charmed Dvinn and my friend proceded to invis him. It worked, we had ourselves an invisible, orc crushing pet. Great thing was, he stayed invisible! Even when attacking, even when charm wore off, even when given SoW and buffs ;) (should see him cruise after orcs with SoW) I am not sure if his corpse was invisible, I zoned in an effort to see if we could get him to attack others and stay invis. My friend killed him almost instantly though and I forgot to ask him. All in all, it was a funny time, an invisible Dvinn with buffs was rocking CB.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                Could this be the answer to the strange events occuring in EQ that we reported yesterday?  <br><blockquote><font color="yellow">This was most likely the effect of a person that was having their name changed by a GM and went link dead. Same thing happened to a guy on my server that had the name of Casanova. A GM went to change his name to Casan but when he went link dead and upon his return there was a npc named Casanova that couldnt be attacked. Only thing that happened was I heard the npc Casanova was able to be pick pocketed and someone got a few plat off of him. Most likely this is what happened since Clitoriss would be considered a offensive name.</blockquote></font>I also received this event regarding other strange names...<blockquote><font color="yellow">I was in Everfrost the other day on Karana server and there was a NPC there named Bongtoker ....close to the entrace to Halas. My thoughts were that they got hacked too... </font></blockquote></blockquote><br>

                How many weird things could happen to just one person?  Well for this guy, it seems like once a week.  Believe the story or not, it does make for interesting reading.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Hi!<br><br>Last night started out a difficult one in Norrath. I had a disaster with Faelanna. She got stuck in a bug  INSIDE a rock and Had to wait for 20 minutes for a Guide to save her and through a very Frusterating misunderstanding,  DIED for the 5th time that night!!! :(<br> <br>I left the game furious and took a break. I am glad I returned because i had the second weirdest night in EQ I have ever had.<br> <br>I created a level 1 necro to locate a corpse in lavastorm and when I went to purchase the locate corpse spell who shoulud be standing there next to the merchant but non other then Clitoriss herself!<br> <br>Being dumbstruck and disbelieving I naturally called everyone in the zone to come and reenforce that I wasnt hallucinating. I also sent a few tells to friends and the guide I had just had dealins with :)<br> <br>All in all we determined that she was an NPC but she was Attack-proof (I attacked her), you could use emotes with her (much to the embarrassment of everyone heheeh) and when you hailed her, her full name was returned to you. ( Hail Clitoriss)The Guides assured us she was NOT a GM and that they had never heard of anything like this before:)<br> <br>My theory is Verdant was hacked and she was installed:) But We shall see:) The guides were very apologetic-unnecessarily- and very Nice about the whole thing hehe. It was hilarious and suitably got me emotionally over my night's loss of 3 bubbles of XP.<br> <br>I am hoping to hear the real story about how and why this occured. If I find anything I will let you know.<br> <br>I have included a few screenshots and will eventually post them on the website as my second weirdest night in EQ.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                For those of you looking for a different look at the upcoming release of Ruins of Kunark, you may want to read Lum's version <a href="http://lum.xrgaming.net/kunark.htm" class="dtmenu">right here</a>!<br><br>Now on the other side, I received a rather detailed log of information regarding the Iksar race.  The information contains every class as well as a listing of zones for the expansion.  Now I got myself into trouble once before by posting information about a game that hasn't come out, (<a href="http://uo2.drtwister.com" class="dtmenu">UO2</a>) so instead of posting this stuff now, I'll wait until I get the ok to release it, and instead will just leave you with the information on how this person supposedly obtained the news.  Maybe you will find something interesting there.<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Just digging around in eqgame.exe some more and found some fun things.  I know this is long, but I wanted to include the text.  These are the descriptions given for the various Iksar class combinations.  I find it odd that they can be both necros and shamans, but who am I to judge?  Also, here's a list of the new zones.  I might have missed a few, though.  You'll notice that many of the names were found on the map of Kunark from Beta, a copy of which can be found at AllaKhazam's still, I believe.  Now if they'd only give us Velious.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

I was wearing an Oracle Robe and he asked me if he could buy it from me.  I told him that I didnt have anything else to wear - so no he could not.  He then asked me if I would trade him it for 1500pp and a FBR.  I had about 9pp to my name at the time and my ranger friend was standing next to me and I knew that he had an extra one.  Being a little sceptical I asked him to put up the 1500pp and the FBR in the trade window first.  He did and everything looked ok, so I put my Oracle robe in the window.  He hit the trade button first and the "green light" on his side went on.  I waited a couple of seconds and still everything seemed ok, so I hit the trade button.  As soon as my "green light" turned on, I saw the number of pp drop to ZERO and then the trade window closed.  He got my Oracle Robe, I got his FBR, but the money did not transfer.  He immediately logged.  I don't know how he did it, but it sucked.  Be warned.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

I<br>know I've done Troll in and out of Felwithe, as well as Skeleton, and Earth<br>Elemental.  It's all about your FACTION, not your race.  This is further<br>proved by my NOT being able to do any of these "evil" Illusions in<br>Freeport.  I have never done any questing for Freeport, or any real combat<br>in the areas around it, that might give positive faction in Freeport. So I<br>get the base, unmodified faction for a Troll, or Earth Elemental, which is,<br>KOS to most if not all city guards.<br><br>	I can't honestly comment on the rest of the it is/it isn't a hoax, but<br>until I see a working copy of it, or a review from a couple web sites: It's<br>a hoax.<br></blockquote></font><br></blockquote><br>

                Something that I lack, :) Read on...<br><br><blockquote><font color=yellow><br>Seems the readers on this site need to grow a freaking brain when it comes<br>to emulators. Seriously.<br>First of all, I checked out those screenshots. They seem legit - no<br>cutting, no pasting. I broke them down in PhotoShop and looked for cloning,<br>name editing, wrong color values on certain GUI and NPC interfaces (color<br>values that are slightly off and not 'true' eq color values would indicate<br>tampering) etc. I have come to the conclusion that those screenshots are<br>real. I have over two years in the prepress industry, where I spent eight<br>hours a day breaking apart and putting together images in photoshop. I can<br>usually spot shoddy work, so take my word for it.<br>Secondly about the wireframe image of paineel - Mox  mentioned that it<br>looked like it was done in paint. Uh, let's think about this logically:<br>someone wants to make a fake zone viewer, so they walk around Paineel<br>(which is running like crap btw), map out the whole zone, then make about<br>2,000 lines to represent the zone. All in less than 24 hours. And then they<br>do it AGAIN for the other screen shot.<br>Right.<br>Lastly, you people missed something so incredibly obvious I can't believe<br>it. There is an OGRE standing next to a HIGH ELF GUARD with nothing on and<br>not being attacked.<br>I'll say that again in case you missed it.<br>There is an OGRE standing next to a HIGH ELF GUARD with nothing on and not<br>being attacked.<br>It doesn't matter if Aradune is a mem hacked name or not. It doesn't matter<br>if it's an illusion. Any ogre in northern felwithe is going to be<br>splattered all over the bridge before she has time to say, "I hacked my<br>name with a hex editor!"<br>And notice that the screenshot clearly indicates that the ogre has just<br>entered the zone. Sheesh.<br>As for the rest of you: your EQ client simply READS PACKETS and displays<br>things on the screen as a result. You don't need a gm tool, you don't need<br>zone info, you don't need that kind of thing. It just takes time to figure<br>out which packets make the EQ client think something has spawned, what<br>packets make it think an inventory item is on a corpse, etc. <br>Shame on you people for thinking this was all a hoax. And shame on your for<br>so obviously spouting off your ignorant opinions to Mox as fact. As anyone<br>can tell you, ShowEQ is half of an emulator right there. And it WORKS. But<br>don't take my word for it. When they get it done and usuable, you can all<br>come play on my server. The first month will be free. ;)<br></blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                Something that I received a couple of days ago...<br><br><blockquote><font color=yellow><br>Well, I've considered writing an emulator myself.  As for the swords.  They<br>aren't based on the character.  How do I know?  It only took one day to add<br>weapons to elementals.  Also, theya re the same on all NPC's and MoBs that<br>weild them.  If they had to do one per MoB/char/NPC then it would have taken<br>weeks to add the weapons to the elements.<br><br><br>btw is there any public packet info?  I would love to start, but don't want<br>to start searching through the packets to get that if someone else already<br>has.  I'm a java programmer and was thinking of emulating one zone at a<br>time.  I might not even release it (source only maybe) but just thought it<br>would be a cool project.<br><br>But what I've seen.  Since everything is handled on the server side.  The<br>emulator could do anything it wants in a zone but add new graphics/Mobs.  If<br>I finished an emulator.  It would be completely different MoBs and the first<br>version would have a user interface to control a MoB.  So that the Mobs<br>would be player based (but not graphical maybe, or just show up as a Ogre<br>character lets say).  But I thought this would be fun.<br><br>So what I'm saying.  It could very well be an emulator.  My biggest question<br>is why they did the 3d wire frame of the world?  It wouldn't really have<br>anything to do with a server emulator.<br></blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

However due to the point of not being able to place NPCs inside a zone, due to the NPC list being create server side not client side, and on top of that there is no possible way right now for him or anyone to place an NPC inside the zone. Why? because Verant use's a separate GM terminal, this can only be accessed via a local computer, and without that code, and program you cannot do what Ashran claims. <br>  <br>So how did he get this? its called memory hacking.

(damn good looking HIE pally, too.) she starts <br>scolding Saroeb, the guy who organized all this, about too many corpses, <br>blah, blah, blah, people are /petitioning, blah, blah, blah.. then she <br>proceeds to UNPK us ALL, upsetting us VERY much, so we run to the PoD, and <br>SHE /KILLS HIM!!! (tho, it was kinda funny to see "Preist of Discord slashes <br>himself for 32000 points of damage! Preist of Discord has been slain by <br>Preist of Discord!!

Well, that is all for now.<br> ===snip===<br>  <br> Sunset Home is the Code Name for cshome. Thats what the Guides Refer to it as. The Sunset Stone is no longer in service. Instead of that, they just /zone cshome. The sunset home *used* to send the guides to the guide room in the PoA, but that room is now occupied by NPCs, so the Sunset Stone was removed when PoA went live. Also, the guides obtain the zone files via email from their server gm's and the special Guide Site they have. Good luck in trying to get it. Also, if you do somehow get your hands on those files, you won't be able to use tutorial.exe to see what it looks like...Verant prepared for that, what will happen is you will appear in mid-air and will begin falling...FAST...and eventually just hit the bottom of the zone and tutorial.exe will crash. You won't see anything but a black screen the entire time. I don't know anything about the Iksar.<br></blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

Make a character of the exact same race, class and name of one that you want to steal. When that person is zoning, keep submititng the character for creation. What can happen is that original high level character you are trying to steal will end up in your account items and all, while your first level character will get transferred to their account.

And you must be a pet class, hopefully Necro or mage since these 2 pets are hardest.  Duel the enchanter and get him to charm you.  Make him make YOU attack yer pet.  Now heh the hard part is for him to stun your pet...hopefully you aint rooted (for earth pets :/), if you are rooted...cancel magic works.  <br> <br>Anyways stun the pet and run like the wind!  Then get the enchanter to mem blur the pet..the pet will leave you 2 alone...but it will scowl at EVERYONE else.  So now youve added another badass to the zone.  the funny part is adding a ton of these to the zone.<br> <br>1.  The whole zone will think a GM event is going on.<br>2.  The whole zone will think there is a spawning problem.<br>3.  A whole ton of shouts.  Elemental to zone!!!.<br> <br>And if you are high enuf lvl...29+ giving these guys weapons...and setting them loose in unguarded zones like the Q catacombs or Q hills, commons work well, Lavastorm doesnt really add that kick since fire elements are there...altho a ton of necro skellies wud be kool.<br> <br>This can be done with a druid in arenas as well.<br>cast pet. hit pet.

                <Blockquote><Font color=yellow>Hey.<br>  <br>I just got done inspecting a gm on Rodcet and saw that he had different equipment than what we're all used to (well, different than what I'VE seen before, anyway).  He was a wood elf druid, according to a /who.  He was named Xajever the Anxious.  He had no weapon equipped, but had this stuff, in addition to the standard verdant stuff:<br>  <br>Helm of the Righteous<br>Breastplate of the Righteous<br>Boots of the Righteous<br>Gauntlets of the Righteous<br>Verdant Vambraces (they normally have Verdant Armplates...)<br>Cape of the Malign<br>Collar of the Malign<br>Guise of the Malign<br>Ring of Banishing<br>Ring of Escape<br>Earring of Shifting Sight<br>Guide Scope (this was in his ammo slot)<br>  <br>I asked him what the Guise's stats were.  He wouldn't tell me :).  He did mention that he was a volunteer.  I had thought that gm's were actual paid employees, with guides being volunteers, but perhaps I'm mistaken.  I do have a few screenshots that I took while inspecting him, and a shot when he said he was a volunteer.  I can send them if you want them.  I'd love to see some stats on this stuff like we did the old stuff.  Oh, and an interesting side note:  I was invisible when talking to him at first, and he kept spinning in circles looking for me, indicating that that spiffy earring doesn't give See the Invisible, or it at least needs to be activated.<br></font></blockquote></blockquote><br>

                A few weeks ago, a player made some remarks about a guild and ended up making a bunch of people upset, and the guild complained, and the statements were false, and I posted some news and -- well, here is his apology!<br><blockquote><font color="yellow">Hello, I would like to correct some false statements I made about KEG on the Rathe, please post this message on your web site.<br><br>I would like to openly apologize to Knights of Eternal Good on the Rathe. I have made a couple false statements about KEG being used as a business to camp rare spawns and sell the items they collect for a profit. These claims are beyond false. As many of you probably guessed I am Advaik of the Rathe. Recently there was a connection made between Advaik and Roebin (who made the statements) and someone realized they were the same person. Getting back on the topic, KEG is a wonderful, truthful guild on the Rathe and they would never do something like this. I am greatly sorry for making these statements and hope this message will mend some of the wounds that I have poured salt on these last few months. Thank you for taking time out to read this.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>
