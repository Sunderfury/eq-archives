                Well, after I returned home a few minutes ago, I logged on and checked my email.  I saw the usual email headers and looked for something interesting.  *DING!*  The producer of EverQuest and VP of Verant's name pops out at me like a bad 50's 3D horror movie at a drive in theater with fuzzy sounding speakers and a spray painted screen.  Upon closer inspection, I find that I have been personally contacted by Mr. Brad McQuaid, the infamous ranger, himself.  He sent me some information on the post I made yesterday, regarding using duped items to instantly log out.  Here is what he had to say on the matter.<br><br><font color="yellow">If you mess with 'duped' items, meaning items the server knows you<br>shouldn't have, you are logged.  The logs are reviewed often.  We ban<br>those who show up on these logs repeatedly.<br><br>--<br><br>---------------------------------------------<br>Brad McQuaid<br>Producer, EverQuest        www.everquest.com<br>Vice President, Verant Interactive Inc.<br>---------------------------------------------</font><br><br>Well, I guess the email says it all.  Be careful with using dupes in an exsploitative matter and do it sparingly.  However, it also says that maybe this page, and my updates are read by the big man in charge himself, and that makes me feel special.  The only thing I don't understand, is why Verant takes a stand on duping, insta-logging, etc exsploits, but were not phased by the "sell prepatch pie tins" exsploit that was reported to them in game on the test server, and was the hot topic on every message board having to do with EverQuest.  Oh well, it's a pointless battle for me to fight, and I am sure Verant learned a lesson there, and we aren't likely to see an exsploit of those proportions any time in the near future.  So, for now, I will just settle with feeling special about the email I received.<br><br>I feel all warm and fuzzy inside...<br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Well, that dupe I posted a while back is ending up to be pretty useful, it turns out.  I got another email from the guy who sent in the mail about the dupe yesterday, and he stats that he has found a money duping bug.  However, us getting our grimey hands on it ain't gonna be so easy.  This is explained in the email I received.<br><br><font color="yellow">Hi Baggle,<br><br>   You remember how I said this bug exploit might lead to other things.    <br>Well I found one mother of an exploit.     I want to try to get in touch <br>with Brad personally on this issue since it could ruin Everquest if it gets <br>out.    Basically I found a way to dupe money using this bug.    If <br>Brad/Verant does not act on this bug in  a timely fashion I will e-mail to <br>you personally how to do it.     Lets just say I started with 50 plat and <br>duped up to 800 plat in about 20 minutes.    This is a money only dupe that <br>expands on the disconnect bug I sent you earlier.    I like playing <br>Everquest with my girlfriend and I do not want to ruin our fun.    On the <br>other hand I am a verification engineer by profession, so I love to find <br>bugs.    I hope you understand.    I will tell you how it works in the end <br>either way.    By the way I think your page is effect in getting Verant on <br>the ball so to speak.     I like it.<br></font><br><br>Well, I can't say that I disagree with this fella's logic.  While I do want the bug/exsploit pretty badly, I can understand where this guy is coming from.

                <font color="gold"><br>Hey there =) This bug's from the same guy that brought ya the Minor Illusion bug. This one allows you to fall through the world. I have only tested this in the BB zone but I'm sure there are several other places where it would work. First, you must use the Minor Illusion bug that allows you to move around as an inanimate object (Cast Minor Illusiong, /q, log back on). Do this Minor Illusion near the entrance to Kaladim (outside gates, still in the BB zone). Now, if you hadn't noticed, you can walk through (most) walls while an inanimate object... Walk through the wall that seperates Kaladim entrance from the hill behind it. Once your back here continue to walk through the hill, after a pretty short time you will fall through the world (which, is really just a wrap around of the sky), this inside of the world suffers from the same problems that happened in doom, warping in over-high corridors. So your inteface may be a little buggy... After some time of falling through the world you'll receive a message "Player is beneath the World at <coords>, teleporting to a safe location...". I'm SURE there's a way to exploit this, I've just yet to find it. I haven't tried binding myself in the middle of the world since I'm not a have enough level =\ If it can be done it could lead to some pretty interesting things... <br><br>-Xeno<br></font>Well I dont know what kind of things you could do if you were binded their, sence if you gated you would appear in the sky, and continue to fall. However I do like the idea of walking through walls. If you can get inside of a wall and cast on a npc while inside the wall, I wonder if you will hit it, or recive the "cannot see the target" message. Because I know there are walls where npcs can not run through, so maybe you can cast on things from inside. Test that out and see what goes on.</blockquote><br>

                Remeber that "dupe" I posted a while back? Remember that it sucked? Well, maybe it didn't suck quite so much. While the dupe itself may not be able to be exsploited in the fashion we are used to, there may be some other things we can do with the duped items, in order to use this to our advantage. Take a look at this email I received today. The exsploit is at the bottom.<br><br><font color="yellow">Noted observations:1. When duped item is traded to a character nothing shows up on the on the other players trade screen window. If the dupe is traded it disappears as the reciever PC never gets the dupe item.2. When duped item is attempted to be sold the shopkeeper does identify the item correctly as well as its value. Hitting the sell button results in say the shopkeeper is not interested and the item is destroyed.3. If duped stackable item is combined with the original stackable item they combine okay. A disconnect occurs once you left click the new combined stack. With this disconnect your PC is instantly dropped out of the server... not like /quit where you hang around before being removed from server. The disconnect happen aproximately a half second after left clicking on this stack.4. If multipul dupes on the same stackable item are made, all the dupes can be stacked. The resulting large dupe stack can be picked up without a disconnect.5. If you use the disconnect described in Observation #3 immediately after clicking on the trade button to complete a trade, you will lose any items you put in the trade window. IE they will not by on your PC upon loging back in or the PC you traded with.6. Duped gems and metal bars can no be used in jewelry kits.7. Duped jewelry kits with no duped gems and metal bars result in a this is not a valid container message.8. Duped items disappear when zonning, logging out, etc.9. Duped items do not disappear on a save.10. If you create a mix duped/non-duped stack as in observation number 3 but in a trade window, only the number of non-duped items will show up on the recievers PC screen. Hitting the trade button in this case results in a disconnect just like number 3??? Not sure as I need more testing with this scenario.11. Need more testing on this, but trying to drop duped items results in bring up the trade screen with the PC in which the item was duped. I need to try facing away from the PC and also running out of trading distance of this PC. Will the duped item will disappear?12. All successful trades result in a save. This in itself would prevent using any sort of time warp to dupe.Exploit:Observation #3 is exploitable in that if you are about to die you can remove yourself from the game so you will not get killed by left click on the mixed duped/not duped stack. Probably several other things as well. Need more testing here as well with this non-regular quit. It could lead to some kind of dupe with consenting corpses.<br><br></font>Now I don't know how many of you played Meridian 59, but I know that some of you did. Recall the term "logger"? Well we might be seeing that term again sometime soon. For those of you who have no idea what I am talking about, Meridian 59 was the first MMP graphical MUD(yes, even before UO...). In Meridian 59, you could instantly log out, no matter where you were. Since the game ran in a window, you could simply do a quick alt+f4 if you got in trouble, and nothing was lost(if you logged before you died anyhow). This resulted in folks being able to basically be invincible if they felt the need. Think of it as recalling in UO, but it takes about 5-10 seconds less time. Wouldn't it be nice if you were attacking something, began to lose the fight, didn't have enough mana to gate, or enough health to run, and you could still survive? It may be possible. Test this out guys, and give me the results! Sounds promising.<br><br>-Baggle<br></blockquote><br>

                Take a look at these two strange experiences this player discovered.  Maybe someone out there could put these to good use.<br><br><blockquote><font color="yellow">I observed something weird just a few moments ago on EQ, Rodcet Nife server.  I had backed up into a corner on the outside of a building in Kelethin, sat down, and logged out.  I then logged on as another character on the same server, played for maybe 10 minutes, then backed into the same corner, sat, and camped.  Then, when I logged on as the first character again, I spawned in a different spot than I had camped!  Instead of being in the corner, I spawned on a different platform (the one at the top of the PoD lift) near the tree in the center.  I can send you the exact /loc where I camped if you want it.  I don't know if this could be used to any advantage (nothing comes to mind, but other individuals may be more devious :) ).  Thought someone might like to know.<br> <br>I'm also curious about something that I can't try, but others with the right types of characters could, and maybe have.  If one rides the boat from Freeport, through the Ocean of Tears, and into Butcherblock, and then jumps overboard and swims down right after the boat zones in, one can fall through the world, effectively, and find oneself surrounded by only sky.  After a few minutes, EQ detects that you are below the zone and moves you "to a safe location," which in Butcherblock, is near Kaladim.  If a character who can bind were to bind him/herself under the zone, he/she could gate back at any time.  Is there a possible exploit in that?  Just something to think about.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

The first day I got EverQuest, I made a character named Baggle on the server that I am still on today.  This is the only Baggle that does, or ever will exist in EverQuest.

According to two sources of mine(one of them being Fashidus), there are actually three connections with you and Verant.  #1 is you sending the game server info, #2 is the game server sending you info, #3 is the catchy one.  This is you sending information to a different server.  This server is more stable, and more reliable.  This explains why, even when you have 100% packetloss, your character is still being saved.  You have 100% packetloss with the game server, not the save server.  This also explains why when you pull the phone jack, you do not save.<br><br>Good detective work, guys.

The files that they sold me are copywrited, and Verant has every right to encrypt them, however, since I own them, I have every right to decrypt them as well.  I also have the right to take them apart, put them together, destroy them, edit them, replace them, print them out, and whack off onto them.  What I don't have a right to do is distribute these files, or harm the company in any way by using them.  Period.  I took a whole year of business law, and I got a C in it, so you can all bite me!

                I dont know If everyone has heard, but there was a change made to the test server recently. In the patch was changes to kiting, and necro's pets. In the change for kiting, ALL dot spells with only work if the npc is not moving, the npc has to be either rooted, or being tanked by another play, or yourself. To me this could have been delt with alot easyer, the dev team felt that a kiter being able to kill yellow, and red npcs, was a bad thing, so they changed the way dot's work. I have an idea for a better way without making a druid have to tank something that hits for 50 a pop with 500 hp. If the dot spells were made to take more time to have their full effect this would be better, I feel.  The kiter would have to do more running and the chance a train to occur would be greater, It would be more dangerous I do not like to solo, becase In a group the Exp sucks. If the dot's took twice as long it would take alot longer to kill the npc, or make the dots easyer to resist by higher lvl npcs, but make it so its either resisted or does its full effect. Also I heard about necro pets being changed in zome way, pls send a e-mail saying what was changed, because there was no news of it on the test center update text.<br><br>On to Sk's here is a <a href="http://www.sotmesc.org/cgi-bin/skpet" TARGET="_BLANK">link</a> to a petition currently going on to try and better the sk class. I play a sk on ec'i a lvl 22 sk, and one thing that I see that could make the sk class a better class would be the lifetap line of spells. Paladins can heal, and eventualy get greater heal(heals 300 hp) which is around 2-3 min of down time for a solo sk. <br><br>I will be absent for the next few days, sorry folks Work, Work, Work.

                Well, to put this in simple terms, we are hated across the EverQuest informational web page community.  A few days ago, I emailed 12 different EverQuest sites, asking for a link exchange between us.  "You scratch our back, we scratch your back" kind of thing.  Needless to say, most of these folks told me to shove it, but in more polite terms.  I can't say I didn't expect this, but it's still a little surprising how many people that run these sites don't realize that this site gets bugs fixed much faster than any other method.  I even got some mail saying "I don't want to spread this kind of information" and "I love EQ because there are no bugs".  Those sound like pretty ignorant statements to me.  You don't want the people who play EverQuest to have access to the information that you have, because you don't think they are smart enough to handle it in a way you would approve of?  I know these guys don't believe it, but some folks visit this site just for the information to send on over to Verant(not like they don't have it already, but it happens). Some sites(*cough* stratics network *cough*) even have specific information given to their updaters instructing them not to post a link to any DTN(Dr. TwisTer Network.  We are hosted by DTN, as is the UO, SB, ME, AC site, etc.) site.  If you do, you are gone(info comes from a friend of mine who works over there).  I actually feel kind of flattered that they would mention the DTN specifically.  If you see a super duper cool bug posted here, don't expect it to be in the game long(same goes for the UO Alert, and every other DTN site), because the public relations folks at Verant/OSI <I>do</I> read these sites.  They get paid to do it, as well(as if reading the rants of Baggle every day at work isn't enough payment).  <br><br>Anyhow, enough about the lamers who are too ignorant to know that this is an informational site, and all varities of people read this.  The heros of the day are the cool sites who know that even if they don't agree with using bugs/exsploits in EverQuest, every citizen of Norrath has the right to know about what is going on around them, know how it is done, how to protect themselves from it, and decide whether or not they want to participate in using the bug/exsploit/info in question to their advantage.  These guys are totally cool, and both of their sites kick total ass.  They are AllaKhazam of <a href="http://everquest.gamestats.com/">AllaKhazam's Magical Realm</a>(best EQ information site on the net, IMO) and Twylight of <a href="http://www.eqdruids.com">EQ Druids</a>(best Druids site on the net.  Includes multiple guides to kiting at every level range).  I personally use and reccommend these sites, especially now, knowing that their webmaster's are really cool people.<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

Minor Illusion is a L1 Enchanter Spell (Which many of ya may not know since almost no one realizes how strong an enchanter can be, even without this nice lil but =) Here's the deal: When you cast Minor Illusion you normally are unable to move, but the reason that all the L50 Enchanter's still have this circle 1 spell memorized is that it grants you totally safe meditation! That's right, all monsters, with the exception of skeletons, regard you *indifferently* to *apprehensivly*. Neither of which is enough to make them attack you. Now, the exploit: Cast Minor Illusiong, LOG OFF using /q. This will instantly dump you to the character select screen (do NOT log off using camp or the trick will not work). Now when you log back on, the Minor Illusion icon has dissapeared but you STILL remain in the shape of a torch (or whatever the illusion hooked onto) and you can MOVE FREELY for the duration of the spell (which, even at level one is about 15 minutes). This is GREAT for scouting out areas and picking off creatures you wanna fight without having to run to the zone line screaming "TRAIN!".

Remember in UO when you could swap bank files and recall off of another character's runes?  Well, maybe we can take this bug to that level, and possibly past it.  One possible(although not as probably as others) scenario would be to put an item in the bank with one character, swap bank files(although at this point, I'm not sure anybody knows where character bank info is kept.  Maybe it's just stored in memory...), take the item out of the bank as another character.  If this worked, the bug <I>could</I> be turned into an all out cheat.  Somebody who has an item ID list writes a program that edits the bank files, and you turn your cloth shawl into a fishing pole, or rubi helm, or anything else that has an item ID for that matter.

When I inqueried about the possibility of him releasing it anonymously, or just releasing the file format, but under his name, he quickly replied that if it goes out, he wants credit for it, and he doesn't want to do all the work with the file format, and have somebody else make the program, and in turn, take credit.

As I said yesterday, pie tin sketches would be something that is awful nice to dupe.<br><br><font color="yellow">The dupe that you mentioned MAY still work with stackable items, if done<br>the right way. I believe (may be wrong but I highly doubt it) that Item<br>ID's are just indexes in the array of all the items on the server (sorry<br>for the programming terms, just think of it like a long list, and the<br>item ID's tell which entry on the list to use). Whenever you create a<br>new item (by buying, selling, looting, etc.), the server is forced to<br>create a new index in that array, or the item would never exist. Well,<br>when you take less than the total amount of items out of a stack of<br>items, the server is also forced to create a new item ID for them. The<br>way that this may apply to the dupe is as follows:<br><br>1) Offer your friend 19 of the 20 items, leaving 1 of them in your<br>inventory. (the 19 items have a new item ID now)<br>2) Do the dupe as you would normally.<br>3) The set of items that automatically returns to your pack should stack<br>with the 1 item left in your inventory (merging two stacks should give<br>the stack that you drag the same item ID as the stack you drop it onto.)<br><br>4) The set of items that remains on your cursor should now be able to be<br>dropped into your inventory without any sort of Item ID conflict.<br>5) Lather, rinse, repeat.</font><br><br><br>And now, the other side(just how many sides are there to this buggar?) to this dupe possibility.<br><font color="yellow"><br>About the dupe, although I really really wish it was possible... I do not <br>think that trade window one is.. They probably have a transaction check... <br>You have "THIS" going into the transaction... it was cancelled, yet you now <br>have "THIS".... and the visual sight of it is merely client side.. I am not <br>saying this is how it is.. but if I were coding it, thats how I would do <br>it...</font><br><br>This is definately a big possibility.

I am not real familiar with the Lavastorm area, but I imagine using this trick with your necro, using LifeTap on some red mobs would get you some xp <I>real</I> fast.  Oh ya, this bug was submitted by "my long time bud and pal"(he made me say that), NiteRaven.<br><br>    <font color="yellow">The entrance to Najena in Lavastorm is a giant doorway. One of the doors has fallen off it's hinges, over the passing of time, and the other on it's way there. While fighting there a few weeks back I came across a nice little exploit which I will share with you now. I play a wizard so hand to hand combat isn't exactly my strong point. So what I would do is stay off at a distance and send off one of my bolts, then quickly start to run away like a coward. Also being a coward I would run close to the Najena entrance just in case things got hairy. A couple of times I would run in there and when i turned to look back the npc was gone, but I still had it targeted and continued to blast it. It took me a few times to figure out what was going on.  <br><br>       Basically what happens is because the wall leading into Najana is slightly slanted the monster instead of moving horizontal along the wall actually goes up the wall and gets stuck at the top of the door. This method works best if you get something to the right of the Najana doors, over that big hill. Otherwise all the other times they just come right into the doorway. Also just in case that tactic fails you can get the monster caught along the wall in the back as you stand around the corner blasting it. It will get caught along the curved part of the wall. I could really only start to do this when I got my level 12 spells. Also I'm sure this can be used in other places with similar design.</font><br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Well, I've already got some feedback on this dupe I posted.  Some are well written, others are from jackasses.<br><br>Letter 1) <font color="yellow">sup, i tried this method of yours with my friend, heres how it went :<br>1. dupe small shit, ah ha LJ vest in bank hehe<br>each time the person who has the LJ dupe, my friend didnt see it , dont work <br>=(<br>2. money !!! every successful try, EQ bo0ts u off, returnin with same amount <br>u started<br><br>so here u go, if u have any more ideas, i would be glad to try it out for you</font><br><br>This was a nice letter.  Thank you for the info.<br><br>Letter 2) <font color="yellow">the dupe is a buncha shit it don't work through any aspect.... you will crash after items duped within minutes, and duping cash causes imediate crash and when you dupe an item the dupe and the original cannot be seen by others and if you try to sell them both to a vendor he refuses the second one. </font><br><br>This was a mean letter.  I now nominate this person for jackass of the year.<br><br>Now that all of this is said and done, let me explain the dupe in a little more detail of how it works/worked.  This has been a bug for months, and many people know about it.  Problem is, Verant is included.  They are extra safe about this stuff, and they check <I>everything</I> for item IDs.  However, I am not sure that this check includes stackable items.  Food, water, pie tin sketches, money(actually, I am not sure what to categorize this in.  I'm not totally positive that it is considered stackable), etc.  While I am aware that singular items with positive ID act strangely when you try to dupe them, things may be possible otherwise.  If nothing else, you might have free food forever.  However, one thing that has changed since I know for sure that this bug has been tested is that when I became aware of it, other players were able to see your items equiped, and they added AR to your character.  According to letter #1, nothing of the sort happened.  I thought the dupe might be useful for at least that much, and since it doesn't work the way I remember any more, I apologize.  There <I>is</I> something to this bug however; we just have to find out how to access it.  I am not sure that this bug can make you 10 sets of rubicite armor, nor am I even sure that you can get free food and drink from it.  Take it for what it is worth however, and maybe one of you readers will find something to it, and report back to us.  If not, easy come, easy go.<br><br>Finally, tomorrow I will be reporting on the breaking story "UnPAKing EverQuest" that dominated the main page today.  I talked with this person at some length today, and found out quite a bit of information.  Whether you are giddy with joy or saddened, tomorrow will definately be a surprise for you.  <br><br>As always, keep the bugs, exsploits, stories, pictures, and flames coming.  <br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Well ladies and gents, the time has come to post that dupe I promised.  Let me start off by saying that this dupe is actually rather well known, and that it can be dangerous to perform with expensive items, as sometimes the EQ safety features will pop in, you will pop out, and your item(duped and unduped) can disappear.  Consider this fair warning!<br><br>An easy dupe:<br>1) open a trade window with your partner in crime<br>2) remove the item exactly as your friend clicks cancel.<br>3) you now should have one item in your inventory, and a duped item in your hands.<br><br>Also, I need to say that dupes in EverQuest can be very strange, thanks to the Item ID tags.  If you want to try this dupe, I suggest trying it with various items that don't have individual tags.  This includes, but is not limited to: money, pie tin sketches, food, water, etc.  I would try these methods out myself, but I can't even log in to EverQuest 80% of the time, so I rarely play any more.  Try it out and let me know your results of using "Baggle's get rich quick plan".<br><br>-Baggle</blockquote><br>

                Well, as many of you may or may not know, EverQuest, like Quake, Quake II, SiN, etc, etc uses a method to store their game files(art, sound, etc) called PAK files. These are something like ZIP files, except for the fact that their format can vary from game to game, and they sometimes/usually hold many, many directories and subdirectories full of files. In the past, these were pretty easy to crack open. Many programs, written by everybody from professional computer programmers to high school kids wrote them for Quake and the like. As I am sure anybody that is familiar with this scene has noticed, EverQuest PAK files cannot be opened/browsed/copied out of/into/etc by any program that is currently available to the public. This is because the EverQuest Dev. team is really paranoid when it comes to their work, and they encrypt and protect EVERYTHING. This includes PAK files. I have inqueried about this issue a time or two to friends who have the experiance to tell me what it would take to crack this program, and needless to say, it would take quite a bit. I basically had given up on this when today, I received an email from a well known misfit in the UO community. He sent me <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Lake/3125/skeleton.wav">this</a> WAV file, telling me that it was "ripped strait from the sound file".  Recognize it?  You should.  That is the pseudo skeleton awareness sound, and it's not just lying around, uncompressed in the EQ directory.  Does this mean somebody has UnPAKed EverQuest?  If so, we could do some pretty cool stuff with it.  Art and sounds to put on your web page or desktop, MODs all over the place, the ability to swap art files and see, for example, Lord Nagafen at every giant rat you passed.  I may be jumping to conclusions here, but this could be a very exciting time for EverQuest.  <br><br>If you have ANY info regarding this, or anything else EQ related, send it on in!<br>-Baggle<br>PS: Welcome back, TheDarkening!  Hope you had a wonderful wedding and honeymoon!<br></blockquote><br>

A glance at any EverQuest screenshot reveals that EverQuest lacks nothing in the graphics department, making full use of that 3D card of yours. Spells churn out colored lighting, 2 layers of clouds roll across the sky, NPCs go about their business in seamless animation tying everything together incredibly nicely. Each region of Norrath has it's own look and feel so it doesn't get too familiar and the engine, created by Verant, handles it all superbly. I did notice however that the engine is a lot smoother in Glide than Direct 3D, with my 8mb Voodoo2 in Glide mode keeping up frame for frame with a 32mb TNT2 Ultra running in Direct 3D. Although this is an API issue, and nothing to do with EverQuest itself. The only gripes I can think of are a slightly low polygon count, and after each server has become saturated with players everyone tends to alike, but then you can only use so many textures before performance starts going downhill.</block></font></blockquote><br>

                Well, yesterday, while experiancing one of the frequent memory leaks, that slowed my computer to a snails pace, of ICQ 97 or 98 or whatever the hell it was, I finally(after 2 or 3 years...) got tired of the memory leaks and decided to *bad word coming up..* upgrade. So I went to mirabilis.com to see what there was to see. Much to my surprise, the site is actually navigatable now, and not one big ball of incoherant mush, like it used to be. So I find the latest version of ICQ(ICQ99b) and download the 5mb monster of a program. I start installing when I notice that I need a database change. So I wait another five minutes waiting for it to convert all of my list and history to the new format. No big deal. Finally, the time comes to log on. This is where things get scary. Up until this point, I had mostly forgotten about the AOL buyout of Mirabilis, but now, it all comes flashing back to me. As soon as I open the program, I am instantly bombarded by so many useless features that I think I will choke on them all. Sounds of a typewriter while I type? No thanks. Horoscope of everybody on my list? Uhm no. Birthday reminder? Sorry. I dont care about most of these people enough to even blink at their birthday. Then I get a message from somebody I know. It's in lovely, unreadable colors, with that ever so nice black background. And how can I forget the best addition of all? The new "I will disappear in 10 seconds window". It's bigger and more irritating than ever! So, finally, I get one or two things under control. I turn off all sounds. The typewriter sounds and that ever so irritating "UH OH!" sound. Now I am just getting on-line alerts, for EVERYBODY on my, list every two seconds. I don't care if they are online. I never asked to be notified of this. So sorry.<br><br>So as I click another On-line alert and curse at AOL for raping this once wonderful program, I bid you all farewell. Expect to see a <I>working</I> dupe here soon. This means today or tomorrow possibily. As always, send those bugs/exsploits/stories/pictures to me.

                This is a fairly simple bug. I used it to max my evocation after I reached level 15 with my paladin. Simply enter Befallen, step to near the stairs, and you will notice a skeleton and a wimpy skeleton standing next to each other. Target either one, stand back a little, where you can only see their chest and up, and fire away with your spells. You will get the message "You cannot see your target", but the spell will go off, you will see the affect of it, the monster will lose zero HP(therefore it will not attack you) and you WILL gain skill from it. You can also raise Divination(Spook the Dead, Blast of Light), and Alteration(buffs, heals) this way. I'm sure it is applicable to many places in order to raise skill to max every level, etc. Hope this helps some folks out. I got to 80 evoke in about 60mins. This includes 'sitting on yer ass doing nothing' time.<br><br>Here's a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Lake/3125/los.jpg">screenshot</a> of me raising evoke with this bug.

                Here is the other side of a dupe possibility.<br><br><blockquote><font color="yellow">The dupe you are trying to figure out WILL NOT WORK! Let me explain why. When you see that "Blahblah saved." thing on your screen, that is not the only save that the server does. the ONLY reason that exists it to save your characters information IF you are not doing anything for a long time. The server saves your character EVERY time you drop an item, or make a trade. This makes dropping an item, then warping back pointless because it warps you back to the second where you dropped that item or made a trade. Try it out, give something to your friend and die while zoning, you will come back to where you gave it to them without the item. This was fairly smart on Verant's side. There is NO way of ridding an item of its ID or changing it, the server keeps very tight tabs on that type of thing to keep a real dupe from occouring. Besides, wouldnt being able to dupe, completely ruin the economy? think about it... everyone is rich as hell - then what does actual money have as worth?<br><br>It becomes worthless and no items are attainable without people getting them by themself, thereby making nearly every good item spawn camped 24/7. This could severely screw the game over if it was possible. I hope you decide to stop encouraging this, there are 95% of us out there that dont want to see this game ruined by a bug such as this.

                Here is an interesting e-mail on duping. Caedmon succesfully duped items.<br><font color="gold"><br>First off the original dupe relied on one MAJOR factor: a bag. U would make this duplicated item and it would disapear when u zone or when the server saved u. But there was one thing that worked.. if the duplicated item was in a bag u could drop it and someone else could pick it up and the dupe would <br>still be there...<br><br>One problem remained a mystery: getting rid of the ID tag. Well we figured that was simple. I made a duplicated item, put it in a bag, dropped the bag, ZONED and then WALLA 2 items. We did this a lot and had 7 backup characters with exacutioner axes full sets of rubicite mithril etc.<br><br>Now the way this duped worked allowed for an even more important thing. We found out that if we have a healing potion in our bag, make a duplicate lets say of Beer, put the duplicated beer item over the potion, put the potion somewhere else, drop the bag with the beer in it and zoned.. a fabulous thing happend. The beer now had the effect of the potion. The big change? It didnt have any charges. So basicaly we had unlimited health and continued to kill tons of NPC's in felwith that night. But 2 days later we found something better, and her name is Ivandry Hoop.<br><br>We basicaly did the same thing. The downfall was when u zoned the effect on the item disapeard so u couldnt walk around with this. So we made tons of corpses in Sol B Kedge Keep Lower Guk etc etc and looted them whenever we want. We also made level 50 characters in a day with this method.<br><br>Now there is a lot of confusion about the use of ID tags and i agree right now the dupe is almost useless. But I found the other day that I could make duplicated bandages and not only did they heal but my bind wound went up. Now UI have a theory: trade skills. Make unlimited banded wsith the same 2 or 3 amterials and sell whatever i make to vendors. Also another idea one of my friends had who was in on this was duplicating spells, spcribing them in our books and thens elling original to save money. Well it would scribe but the duplicated scroll would stay in curser and there was no spell in the book.<br><br>I have many more ideas and I even managed to find a way to put items to large for a container into a container and trade no trade items. While these methods work if this letter gets posted on the site ill explain how to do this and how to make messed up plat (i managed to sell a dupe to an NPC get plat and still have original... there are problems with this tho and its hard to make this varient of a dupe).<br><br>Caedmon</font></blockquote><br>

                Im almost positive that if you dupe money it will work like normal money. Acording to Bagle you can zone, unhook your phone cord, and when you log back in, you will be at your last char saved spot. If this is so then duping would be very simple, I invite people to try it out see what happenes. Here is the e-mail.<br><font color="gold"><br>       Regarding today's update, I'm willing to bet that you are time warped back to your last character backup.  You can tell when the last character backup was because you lag for a second and see "Soandso saved.".  Also, you do not have to die to get this time warp to work.  You can start zoning, unhook the phone cord(or power off the comp, or whatever) and you will time warp as well.  A possibly use for this is duping money.  Go near a zone, wait until your char backs up, hand money to a partner, start zoning, pull the cord on the game, log back in.  You may now have the money you had on yourself 2 minutes ago, and so does your partner.  A problem with this would be that, like other duping methods, you get both items, and other's see what you 'have', but they disappear after you log out.  I have never tried to sell a duped item to an NPC(there is a working dupe, but I am not sure that it's worth the trouble right now), but I have heard that the NPCs will not pay for the<br>item.<br> <br>       Now, this brings us to another interesting thought.  Other players see the items you have, even though it is duped and will disappear after you log.  You see the item give you AC, and you see it equiped, but I think that this may all be client side, and the only thing you're actually affecting if what you look like.  It only appears as though you have better AC, but it really isn't making a difference server side.  One possible use for this is 3rd party programs down the road.  You could tell the server that you had a full suit of rubicite armor, and a fiery avenger, and the server would report this to all other players who see you, even though, in fact, you are a level one.  Of course this is all theory, though, and maybe I am totally off base.  Something to think about, though.<br> <br>-Baggle</font><br><br>There is only one thing wrong with that. If you zone and pull your phone cord and log back in, and you did time warp, who would have the real money? Also if it was client side, no one else but you would be able to see the changes, because all that they see is server side.</blockquote><br>

I have heard in the past of a guy who found out how to dupe money in the beta, and he told a gm in return for a last name, and on top of that he deleted all the duped money. So I belive it is possible to actually dupe something like money, sence there is so much money it would be impossible to have each pp be differnt than another.

                Ok everyone I have a possible dupe for you. I have personally been a part of the <br>process, but its very hard to complete so I never took the time to actually try it. But <br>please go out and try it and send back Info on it. All right here we go.<br><br><FONT COLOR="GOLD">This is EXTREMELY hard to do, but I think it would <br>work. I am going to tell a story to explain how this works. Back when I played my <br>cleric I was in unrest fighting at the zone line, so when I was almost dead I could <br>zone. Well a funny thing happened when I did this. After the the "Loading Please <br>Wait" went away, I noticed I was back in unrest, not just back at the zone line, but <br>back by the house. I thought how could this be? At the time I didn't realize what had <br>happened. But it happened again a week later I was fighting at zone line and I ended <br>up without my spells memorized, because 2 minutes before I died and went to get <br>my corpse and didn't get a chance to mem my spells. Just today It happened again to <br>me, Fighting at zone line in nejena almost dead, and I zone. End up back in nejena <br>back inside the zone, not just near the zone entrance, but back where the TT's <br>spawn. The bug seems to center around Dying when zoning at the same time to <br>cause this time warp. Sometimes when I fight at zone line I would zone at 2 bars of <br>health and when I reach the other side im at like 1 bar of health, So if you do this at a <br>really low health and you die when zoning there is three things that can happen. <br>1. you successfully zone<br>2. you get kicked back and never zone<br>3. time warp back about 10-15 seconds<br>I remembered that Verant tried to fix this. Most people know because sometimes <br>when you fight at a zone line and wait till your almost dead to zone, people have <br>ended not on the other side but right at the zone line. I think verant tried to fix this, <br>but it seems in some rare occasions time warps happen. So, here is what I would try <br>if someone is interested in this. Bring a monster to the zone line, something that hit <br>hard , but before you zone give some money or a item to a friend and zone. So when <br>you time warp back you friend should have the item and so should you.</font><br><br>Try this out Please send info if you can successfully get it to work.</blockquote><br>

It allows for kill stealing and other various<br>exploitation of the system. Currently, the person who deals the most<br>damage to the monster/creature gets the full experience for the kill<br>(groups not apply). This would be fine if this was a single player game,<br>but it is not, and it is people who ruin this system.<br><br>Example:<br><br>Person A attacks creature X. Creature X takes a good deal of damage from<br>person A, about 45%. Then, person B comes along and attacks Creature X,<br>and deals it 55% damage. In this case, person B "stole" the kill from<br>Player A, and player A got no experience for his or her troubles. What<br>_should_ happen, is this: Player A gets 45% of the experience from<br>Creature X, and Player B gets 55% of the experience. This way,<br>everything is fair.<br><br>Of course this will not stop people from "kill stealing," but it will<br>help those who are frusterated with not gaining anything from fighting<br>in a battle stolen from him.</font><br></blockquote><br>

                Here is one players views on tips to follow when being a cleric.<br><br><block quote><font color="gold">After 22 lvls of playing my cleric (i stoped there) i came to the conclusion that while  the healing was better then any other class and the spells damage was very effective as need to be the olny true down side to ceric is Melee were you are limited to far below tradition dictates. Thats it all the other stuff is just people who want to be a caster or a warrior with a healing class(not gonna happen and they made sure of it to).  The olny solution is to gather you Platt and buy or get the best possible armor and wepon you can get at all time your armor should be within 10 points of your hps as a cleric or better. On that note if you can afford it items that provide adjustments to 2 stats are you best friend any item you can get that will boost strength and dex  will greatly improve your performance.(wisdom cant hurt either)<br><br>One last very important piece of advice and if olny this gets posted and everything else gets left off ALWAYS always join a group if you have the chance ! A cleric witout a group is like meat without salt you can eat it but its just not as tastey :)<br></font></blockquote></blockquote><br>

I would like to introduce myself, I've been playing EQ since the public Beta, and just recently acquired a newer machine, which definately enhances game play. :) I often troll EverQuest's Support MessageBase, so if I find a major issue, it will likely be posted.

                Hi, Im Smasher. I will be helping Dr.T with news/bug updates for this site. Some of you may know me from <a href="http://xsploitz.com/c&s/" TARGET="_BLANK">SmAsHeR and CrAsHeR's real audio show</a>. I am very excited to be a part of this network, anyways onto a nice little bug I found. <br><br><font color="#ffff33">In some zones there is a spot where npcs get stuck, or turn and run away. Its like an invisible line and they cannot move beyond this point. In So Ro desert at the zone line to oasis, if you bring a npc to this line it will stop and run away. Simply cast on it as it runs away and move back over the line if it gets to far and it will come running back at you. Simply repeat the process until its dead.<br>Here is a small list of spots I know of <br><br>South Ro at zone line to Innothule swamp<br><br>In upper guk (only works on crocs) at Innothule zone line<br><br>South Ro at oasis zone line<br><br>North Ro at tunnel entrance to East Commons<br></font><br>If anyone knows of any other spots please e-mail me.</blockquote><br>
