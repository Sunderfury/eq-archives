It was light years beyond anything on the market and was actually "fun" to play at the time and for maybe 6 months later.<br> <br>Out of the blue appears a new Everquest "Internet relations manager" by the name of "Abashi". And never in the history of my game days have I ever met a more clueless fuck, and to this day I still wonder how this guy still has a job.<br> <br>I dont know if it is the way he comes across to people (yes I'm sure this is the problem) but I know in my business if I treated my customers the way he treats EQ's I surely would be penniless. He is often rude, discourteous, and downright tyrannical in his viewpoints on what EQ is and what it should it be. <br> <br>Sure, he is probably just a pawn for Verant, <i>scratch that</i> he IS a pawn but I do think he writes his own sentences and paragraphs on his own. Also the fact that EQ is extremely popular and there really isn't another mmorpg to be played right now he can pretty much get away with anything and everything he wants to say. Hopefully this will change soon.<br> <br>Everquest has many good points too go along with the bad and I probably should make links to the myriad of stuck-up, tyrannical, non-customer supportive posts this guy has made but fuck, just read <a href="http://www.lumthemad.com">LUM</a> everyday and you will be smitten with examples.<br> <br>On the Everquest boards otherwise known as <a href="http://boards.atation.sony.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">"whineplay"</a> there has been some new rules and a new <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/forum_faq.html">faq</a> posted to stop some of the outrageous threads that occur there. *HINT* (most of these threads were outrageous because of "Abashi's" non-sensical replies to posts by players who PAY his salary). So now If you don't post according to their new standards you can actually have your account banned or suspended.<br> <br>My guess is ABASHI was probably getting real sick of listening to people bash him all day long. And for someone who actually plays a ranger and thinks that they are pretty much perfect is enough to prove what a jack-ass this guy is. (MY GUESS is that he is really a NECRO and just loves fucking with people). <--- some sarcasm.<br> <br>I know a few people who actually still like socialism, but do me a favor VERANT. Fire this guy and hire someone who actually does some good for your game. Because before you know it competition will be at hand, and guess what? We will have a choice on whether or not to listen to your "Internet relations manager" or play another game.</blockquote></font><br><a href="http://forums.drtwister.com/showflat.pl?Cat=&Board=eqwhine&Number=271&page=0&view=collapsed&sb=5&part=&vc=">Should Abashi stay or should he go?
