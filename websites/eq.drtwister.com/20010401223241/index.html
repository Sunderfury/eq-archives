You cannot give away or allow another person use of your EQ account. So save your breath,just list it,set a fast buy out and set 1st bid as same price as buyout. That way you get the least you will accept and if tis fair it will move in the 1st day,PRIOR to it being removed from ebay. Its what i do and it works well.<br><br><br>No new news on the " Gm or Tunare Clint who can program neat untraceable coades since he is a gm and the neato-keen guy"<br> He wont answer emails concerning his attempt to portray a GM on the tunare server . Several of his potential customers did email me. I told em to avoid him like the plague. Liar,scammer,hustler....not the person id just blindly send money too . Many of you like me, many more cant stand me, thats all good. I dont use a spell checker and type to fast and dont correct my mistakes causing me no end of harassing email, but its ok. But please keep in mind i will not mislead you or lie to you . People like this clint guy...im here to warn you about people like him, side stepping my temper,bad typing/spelling and my plain ol ranting, i do try to make sure you people do not get screwed by scams and bugs. So please keep this in mind when i do post about something of this nature )<br> Now lets go back to the bad spelling,cursing,ranting and flaming now that i have given my public service announcement.</font></p>

Now if your the risk taker,go for it. I, myself, will not touch it with a ten foot pole.<br> I wish the guy luck, the screen shots make it appear to be easy to opperate. but i dont want to blow 2 years of work on editing parts of the game that are visably detectable as well as able to be monitored by Verant. Yes thier client side edits BUT when you use them the info goes server side...why did noone figure that part out ?

Many people who purchase the accounts ( most owners wont tell thier guilds thier eBaying)seem to just plain ol' suck.<br> Many guilds/players are crying out against ebayed chars usurping characters identities,stealing from the old owners friends . Its sad but true. I have recieved many emails about this type of player. Buy an account $600-1000....."Hey bro, its me..loan me your PKT.." Sells borrowed items for PP then sells PP on ebay,recoups initial investment then claims no knowledge saying " i just bought the account today" or some such similar bullshit. One such case is where a person,im told it was The origional Photek, on a loaner account,acted to be another guild leader of a LARGE guild, using a with a vowel  variation in the name ( making IE a EI) and demanded access to a player account( who the GMs offered to restore and still havent). The player, thinking it was his guild leader, did such and was subsequently ripped off . Another instance is described in this email from a Fennin Player <br>  <i> .. Ok so i let Gwiz( purchased thru an email deal i found out, not to be confused with the origional) have access to my account and a friends he proceeds to rip off a TON of items in a day . I trusted Gwiz who was bought by the old erebis who was , i THOUGHT, a good friend. When i mention this he ignores me, when i brought this up to his guild they shrugged it off. I then find out hes accused of this at least 2-3 times a month. Is it him who sucks, or his guild , <a href="http://www.defendersofakanon">DoA</a>, for tollerating it and not doing anything about it. I wish they would try to be more like the guild there trying to out do, TMO, then acting like lame asses who could care less who thier guild mates rip off and screw in the name of friendship and DoA....i respected them and even aspired to be apart of them until this happened...now EQ just sucks for me.</i> <br> Why are people like this tollerated ? I was told of a similar story from Vazalle, i go there and this guy, like Gwiz and many others are STILL in thier respective guilds and as rumored,still stealing from newer members who are stupid enough to trust them with account info. Stories like this that are repeated over and over  lead me to belive ,that yes,the guilds are in on it as well or at the very least several higher up officers. Why else would such actions be tollerated ?<br> Do these scammers have thier guilds so snowed that they dont belive the tales ? Or is it because the guilds themselves are in on the same thing ?<br> Who know... So remember fellow EQ players.....alwayes be on the lookout, and NEVER trust anyone with your account info and MAKE SURE if you do sell your account that key people in your circle of friends do know you sold, its only fair to them , as well as your guilds.<br> Anyone wishes to tell me thier horror story feel free to email it to me.<br> To the players mentioned in this story ...i hope you cant ever play your server without being called thief and i do hope your guilds suffer the same rep until thier shunned or you have to resell ..because its people like you and they who have put a true barrier between freinds who can nolonger trust each other because of the likes of you.<br> Mr.Orange<br> Defender of the nice guy.<br> Asshole to the thieves.<br> Deluded into thinking he makes a differance.</font></p>

The page,as Dr.T said, is being revamped and i cant wait.<br> A fast recap,as i am late for work.<br> Glitchless has decided to delete every post i made on thier forum as soon as they see them, even though i was well with in the TOS for that board.<br> The questions i asked reffered to Dawn as being a possible Scam and not a game. Dawn people are loyal it seems to an extent. A moderator answered some of my questions and the answeres were quite funny.<br> When i asked why does dawns web broswer game have banners so close to the spot you have to click,forcing misclicks ( i did this near 100 times in 4 hours ) he said " well if them making it that way gets em more money for the game to come out faster,then i say its a good thing" .<br> Im sure this guy found himself in a soup line shortly after his reply was discovered.<br> Lum the mad went on a tangent last week saying the net was dying...ok lum. Rejection in the game development community must play hard on ones mental abilities . We wish him a speedy recovery.<br> Rumors on the SB message boards lean toward SB as loosing its publisher...i was directed to Lum ( is this karma ?) who has a nice, albeit spiteful, story on it, no need for me to recap .<br> Theres some nice bugs in UO and EQ id like to throw up as soon as the page is 100% ready ..so suck in your guts, get off your sister, and stay tuned.</font></p>
