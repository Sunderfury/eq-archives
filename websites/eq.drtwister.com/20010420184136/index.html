Supposedly its going to have a new engine, race, class, and planet (Norraths moon). From what I hear he name is supposed to be 'EverQuest: Shadow of Luclin' and the site is at www.everquest.com/luclin/ . Well this new expansion will suck, why? because there's been 2 expansions and they are just going to make you pay more money to buy another. The only thing in this expansion I look forward to is the engine, finalfuckinly they are going to make the graphics look better as well as enhance player models. Anyways, knowing me I'm going to find more information for you guys to munch on =).

A sample of what i read in there follows.<br><p><br><blockquote><i> ....EverQuest 2 will be a sequel to EQ1 in flavor and functionality.  We will attempt to expand the depth and scope of the game while we insure the flavor of the title will not change.  We will learn from all of EQ 2&#8217;s predecessors to avoid design pitfalls and give use the flexibility to tweak and tune all aspects of systems to assist in combating new issues that arrive.  We will tune the game for PVP over 200 levels and ship with a PVE emphasis with 50 levels. ...<br><p><br> .....<br>In Everquest 2 players will have the ability to buy and build up property. We determined that players could buy and upgrade three basic types of structures: residential (homes), commercial (shops), and industrial (forges, bakeries, etc.). We will set the locations in which the players can build these properties as predefined zones.  This will allow the areas in which players own property to maintain the look and feel of Everquest. Also, in this manner, cities will develop over time and even new player owned and run cities can be generated. The amount of property one can own will be hard capped to avoid cluttering and an upkeep cost will be associated on all property based on how valuable it is. All of these features will work towards keeping players more attached to the world while giving us the controls necessary to make it look great...</i></blockquote><br><p><br> Sound like BS ? who knows...lets ride this monkey.....more to come</font></p>

SO i junp in and D/L from the slowest server Mythic could find for the patcher.Then i log in,view the keyboard layout and start a character.We start with a female Brit, my wifes char. I figure out how to target and attack and loot items. Woman of mine figures out how to sell items  SHEESH i admit i was stumped there for a bit. She accidently tried to buy something abd when the icon popped up she figured it out.<br><br><br> Ok so now we got the basics. Then came the part on how to figure out whats safe to kill. Colors are similiar to EQ  Red/Orange/Yellow/Blue/White/Green for how hard they are in relation to your level.<br><br> <br> I talk my wife into going to bed and BOOYAH ! Im in there. Troll Viking ( sounds wierd i know) . Was really easy to play and figure out. Cool graphics on the race. Leveled to 6th in a few hours,became a beserker and liked the effect )<br><br><br> DAoC, in my oppinion on my 1st night, has issue to deal with as one would expect. The connection is fairly laggy around structures. The fact that anything you buy from a vendor is told to everyone within ear shot :). And a few other things. I like thier monsters and the designe on them. I like the races/classes so far. I LOVE my troll.<br><br><br> DAoC needs to add a few filters wich im sure will happen. Over all i think this game is MORE than on Par with EQ. The graphics base on monsters are the same to me, the settings are graphicly close (EQ's are a bit sharper) and the login screen is cooler on DAoC .<br><br><br> I said it before now ill emphasize it. THANK GOD DAoC is around the corner cause you people out there are gonna love it.EQ would be a contender for its up and comming expansion except we all know it will be the same crappy customer service/GMs no matter what expansion.<br><br><br> Reason im moving to DAoC ? It looks great, seems to be designed with RPers in mind not Grief 133t boys like SB does. And because im tired of playing a game i really like only to see its piss poof employees messing it up ( EQ) So im GREATFUL to Tel0net for his help and so is my wife. </font></p>

We quit many other games to play it. SOme loved it others hated change and left. Many of us, tired of pathetic answers to pathetic situations.moved from UO to EQ. Once such migration was my old guild in UO.<br><p><br><a href="http://www.pioneernet.net/claw"> C.L.A.W</a> is ,without a doubt ,a guild based on honorable ideas and intentions and actions.I was once a member of CLAW in EQ and in UO and in the heat of personal frustration i left and in doing so alienated many friends. I still stop by and see my friends posts and i even throw a post down myself, often ignored, but who can blame them. Musashi is one of the most honorable players in EQ. His not perfect nor is he flawless, but to me he is the embodied spirit of whats good and fun in EQ. But spirits fade...with the onset of verants obviouse favoritism to Uber guilds, people like CLAW are discarded like trash to the dump. Past accompishments and heroic deeds forgoten or maybe never even cared about. It is my oppinion that EQ has now moved into yet anotehr stage of alienating players by forcing thier hands. YOU MUST be Ub3r to get good loot. You must be in Ub3R guilds to obtain sed loot. FUCK fire even verant admits new monsters will take 100+ people to kill. That sound like the fun game we all signed up for ? Musashi posted his farewell post and it about made me want to punch my monitor and piss on my copy of EQ. I dont know. Im too upset to say what i want and it come out right.<br><p><br> Musashi you are the type of player we all want to be, what we all strive to be and so often end up falling from grace. Forgive us all for letting you down.

His <a href="http://http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/002502.html">Post</a> scared me shitless. And im sure after many read it will feel the same. Its long, its horrible but its here.<br><p><br><blockquote>Lets start off here on a good note  It is possible that I might be an Ex-GM of Verant, or maybe not, believe what you will. I have been reading this board for some time and I wish to make some comments.<br>1. Items do not have serial numbers. Each item in the game has a number, which is used to create the item, like an index number. These numbers never change. Quite simply, if you and your friend have a soulfire each, they are exactly the same, a Gm cannot tell the difference.<br><br>2. EVERYTHING is tracked. I mean it, litererally everything. If you drop it, its logged, if you pick it up, its logged, if you put it in a forge, its logged. you get the picture. All trades are logged and detailed as to the items traded to whom and from whom. Your IP address is logged when you login to the game, each time you change your billing and information a record is kept. Cash is tracked, how much you have and how long you had it, a history is provided. (Cash is converted to copper, the standard and tracked that way)<br><br>3. There are cheater logs, 2 that I know of at least. One tracks players hacking SOW and the client. If you ever HEXed the client and got booted off, you were logged off as a cheater and logged. The other file has something to do with zoning and such and was never fully explained to me.<br><br>4. GM's have a log of those that fell through the world, its called fellworld.txt, they just do not use it and ignore it as its a pain to get out of the game to go check logs.<br><br>5. There are 8 levels of backup availible to GM's. Its viewpc 0 thru 7. Its unclear how the backup is taken, it is supposed to be a roll over, meaning level 0 is today, 1 is yesterday and so forth, but its totally hosed up and its like 2 days then 3 weekly's then a nightly. But they can see what you had on you yesterday and the day before and thats how you guys are getting caught in your scamming <br><br>6. EQ servers are pathetic, home brew boxes running dual pentium 3's just recently upgraded to 800's The code is MS C running on NT. There is one world server and then zone boxes which run multiple zones each. Forget hacking the servers, I was told there is several layers of firewall and protection, the best there is out there.<br><br>7. GM's Don't care about you. You are an avatar, thats it, each GM is instructed to treat each customer as if they are lying and scamming, which is why the CS there is such crap. The CS dept changes rules about once a week, to fit the whim of upper management.<br><br>8. Brad Who? Brad McQuaid may not exist. In the time I worked there, I never saw him, nor saw an office. I do not believe he exists  I do know that Brad does not have an Aradune character on over half the servers, meaning he has never bothered to even log into most of them.<br><br>9. Abashi is a true A-Hole. He is now your worst enemy, as he SOMEHOW got put on the actual development team and makes decisions for EQ. Thats right , the guy that stated you can med without the book at level 32, that guy. And yes, he hates you intently, takes it as a personal battle with players. I heard about his comment when VI "fixed" the clerics hate list thing... "So clerics always complain to me they are bored, well, we will just add DEATH to their sit,med,heal, that will fix them"<br><br>9. COmplain, Complain, Complain... Thats all you have to do to get what you want. Spam email the company, write everyone with your twisted tale, in the end you will get whatever you want as they get tired of the BS. I cannot tell you how many times management has created entire lists of things for players solely based on the fact they never stopped emailing them and they were tired of it.<br><br>10. No, VI cannot stop ShowEQ or detect it, Nor could they detect DXwindows, tho they did break it...<br><br>11. Favouritism . Yes, there is tons, but not to players. (Unless you are a developer, then you can give your buddies whatever you want and no one gives a damn) GM's routinely assist with VIP's and others who get the red carpet and anythign they want in the game. <br><br>12. Yes, the game is geared to the high level Guild players. Newbies are looked down on while uber guilds are in high regard. <br><br>13. The most powerful GM tool is....SNOOPING! Most of you guessed it, but yes, a GM can see what you type to anyone, entire guildchats can be snooped with an anonymous GM. Next time you pull off that scam or cheat someone, don't be an idiot and brag to your friends...<br><br>14. Management cheating... Yes, they do all the time, they have the D3D at home and use it. YOu all know Lady Degarmo? "She" is a he, and a bit rough around the edges, if I may add. I have heard he playes characters on the ZEK servers and often uses the D3D to wipe out anyone he dislikes. Talk about a low life scum in my book.<br><br>Do with this what you will, and believe what you like to. All the things about logs and how the game works is 100% true, the others are hearsay from other GM's...<br><br>SkrewVI......<br></blockquote><br><p><br>Im going out 1st and saying he sounds like a disgruntle ex-employee. he may be all peaches and daisies but he sounds pissed. Pissed people tend to embelish,exaggerate, LIE. So take this with the grain of salt it is. It may or may not be fact. I , for one, and waiting on <a href="http://www.darkageofcamelot.com">DAoC</a> myself and so is my wife. EQ has been fun and will be fun for a good many more months but they day that suckers on the shelf EQ can kiss my hairy ass.<br></font></p>

Warlords meet and give counsel to guildleaders and larger guilds are formed from small...but what if....<br> On fennin ro a possible 1st is occuring. 2 rival guilds who bicker and spat on the message boards and in /tell have possibly decided to put thier differances aside and form an EQ 1st. 2 self proclaimed Uber guilds of fennin ro , TMO and DOA might be merging to form the LARGEST Mega Guild of EQ's brief history. Several message board threads hinted at such a possability and several corespondances ingame have led me to belive this might actually happen. Why would this be an EQ 1st ? 2 guilds have cleared veeshans Peak on fennin ro..yes TMO and DOA. TO my knowledge no other server can lay  claim to such accomplishments. If this does happen it opens a path to Verants supposed claim of making newer mobs for certain quest items require 50-100 people to defeat key MOBs,for Fennin ro to be the 1st server to defeat a lot of these alleged MOBs . Many questions come to mind. Whos the overall leader , most servers know a council approach fails miserably, how to coordinate 100 people in a raid, how to assign groups for such a large number and god forbid, how to assign loot. I , for one, do not see this happening anytime soon for several reasons i listed as well as many unlisted. With the influx of ebayed characters into the ranks of such guilds, many guilds are faced with a mounting distrust towards rumored ebayers. It will be nice if this does happen as im sure the Mega Guild would unseat any other previously #1 ranked guild in EQ *cough**cough**FOH*cough*. We all know EQ started as a fantasy Role Playing game and has now developed into a loot festing, 1 upmanship. The competition is fast,furious and aggressive. <br> So all you other servers look to fennin ro's TMO and DOA for a possible 1st...and if it fails it will be just another defeat in the long list of fennin ro flops. Many people reffer to people in TMO and DOA as asses or pricks or loot whores. But , past differances aside, what must one do to become #1 ? What commitment has a person given to escalate to such hights ? Think of what they have done and you wish you could do before casting dispersions. Im not defending the farming of items for twinks, thats a joke and pathetic. I am reffering to 24 hours straight spent breaking a new zone and loosing or conquoring it. Think of time and dedication given to make these accompishments...then think of what these 2 guilds merging will mean.<br> Edarion is a level headed guy who screams out orderes punctuated with the word fuck. Ikikguld is a leader who likes to scream fag at people. As indaviduals they are both small people....put them both in the forefront of a developement of this magnitude and you just might have the meanest, ass kickingest guild to ever be seen in EQ.<br> Wish them luck and give them support.<br><br></font></p>

One can see where TMO would be pissed but then again the game was created for us all, not a select few. Good luck to them on future zones and to tight lips )<br> <br> Another story brewing. It concerns a website listing people who they feel suck on fennin ro and also it describes how this person has looted,stolen accounts and ebayed stolen property. Ill have the story soon after some correspondance with another Orange and the site ADMIN. So stay tuned for more bitch fighting !<br><br>No i refuse to use a spell checker.

<p><font color="#990000" face="arial" size="3"><b>Mild update ...time for a civil rant</b></font><br><font color="#ffffff" face="arial" size="1">Posted Sunday, April 8, 2001 by <a href="mailto:mrorange@drtwister.com">Mr.Orange</a><br><br><font color="#ffffff" face="arial" size="2">As the servers crash and the Chat servers crash i find myself sliding over to play tanarus. As i play tanarus i notice i cannot go into 1 arena for more than 20 minutes and not see someone with edited tanks . These are reffered, but definatly in nomeans,Hacks. As i see verants attention to its Tanarus servers i begin to wonder is the same instore for EQ ? Both are verant ran and verant staffed. In EQ its Game Masters or Guides. In tanarus its Battle Ops. The BOPs tend to not be on worth a damn between 4am and 7am . The same goes for EQ.I , personaly, find verants lack of attention to this particular time frame annoying as its my primary play time. I will go ahead and say both games are fun but verants lack of action against " hackers" is at best  a pathetic joke. I have heard of people getting banned thru a friend of a friend but have only personaly had any contact with 2 . On a server hosting an avarage of 2500 players only 2. May i go out on a limb and say theres a hell of a lot more than 2. Why cant verant detect 2 corpses with the same items on them   ?? Verant are you unaware that you can dupe a corpse by Zoning/Crashing/Gating the second you die ? Oh you say precision timing ....no...We all know neither is instant and there is a 1-2 second room of margine for all. The point where you die and zone. WHy is this occuring now ? It used to be death when zoning would debuff you and pop you into the zone safe spot. Now this is tricky but its doable and happens daily. Why is it not addressed or at least spoken about publicly ?<br> <br><br> We ALL hated the pathetic jokes that OSI did. Sweeping bans, deleting items, canceling characters. But was it a bad thing ? I say that OSI had a handle on its crooks better than verant. I list/post bugs openly hoping verant will take enough notice to try and fix these bugs. Why have other bugs never been fixed ?<br> <br><br>SoV has been out a goodwhile, yet in the Tower of Frozen Shadow the pathing will train everyone and kill them horribly. This is not a game design, its a game error and they are rarely fixed. Again i say, EQ is a super game and i enjoy it daily but i do wish instead of grasping for that Xtra buck  ( YOU TO CAN OWN THE GOD GAME FOR $9.99!!!!) try fixing the little things. I know theres a ton to do, i notice everytime i patch goes down, bugs i never knew about are fixed, but how about the most common and oldest ?<br><br><br> Another issue is 3rd party programs.Most of you people dont know it, but 75% of the people who try a 3rd party are curiouse. Not xsploiters but curiouse players. Im not defending 3rd party progs like Everhack which claims to do a large variety of things which i see to be mostly seen client side but not having a server side effect.  I mean changing an items WIS to 100 instead of 10 will not effect you in anyway, its nothing but a cosmetic for you to look at. Or GM speed .....well....you really got to be a dumbass to use that one. But why ban someone for changing thier speed ? Most people doing minor things like that will learn thier lesson after a 30 day suspension. I know a guy on fennin ro, who was told by a guild member that she made a program that does neat things. THis person in his curiosity checked it out and made his characters speed GM. Now 1st he was stupid, curiouse, but stupid. He wasnt accused of duping, Using the corpse replication bug that you do at a specific LOC that these programs will let you go to, he wasnt even changing the No-drop tag. He was curiouse and tried the speed part because : it looked neat"<br> 54 levels and 2 years of game play flushed for curiosities sake. Verant should have given him a 30 day suspension. Thats my oppinion.]<br> A guy logs onto his friends account cause he cant get on his and the station # is locked up with a 1-2 hour Que. He logs into his friends account and pages a GM to help him with his account being stolen...his friend gets banned for a EULA violation. <br><br><br> I can honestly say i love EQ and its staff must put up with hell, but thier judgement sucks very bad. Were i police officer and played EQ and lucked into a verant employee speeding id return a lot of payback ) I mean...you ever seen a pissed off cop write a ticket ? Speeding can turn into resisting arrest . Anyway, Verant keep up the good work and stop being stiff asses. Bust the real cheaters and leave the curiouse Joe who makes 1 mistake and wastes 2 years of his time .<br> <br><br> BTW. Both people now play Tribes and are anxiously awaiting <a href+'http://darkeageofcamelot.com">Dark Age of Camelot</a> as am i. verant needs to readdress its policies and its order of importance before the new game hits the market...because they will do to you what you did to OSI. Players get pissed over little things and bad policy escalates it into a " screw it DAoC here i come" mind set and then your scrapping EQ2.<br><p><br> Peace all</font></p>

It may make you feel all warm inside and fuzzy but it doesnt make it right. Someone stole Gwiz's account,according to him, and wont give it back !! Bad bad person !! Dont take anyone elses account...ok now your forgiven, go play.<br><p><br> Ok i gotta rant a bit more. Like his whole guild, all 10 people , ripped and ranted on me then banned my IP after my comments started makin em all woozy.. HAHA..i mean im laughin here,really, go read this complete DUMBASS's comments and threats about this on the <a href="http://www.defendersofakanon.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000356.html">DOA board</a>. HAHAHA. Its a funy thread. BUT. It does have a sad part. Hes got a lot of his guild members so snowed, they feel sorry for this guy. Oh well.<br> Jesse wanna know how  an account gets jacked and gone for good ?<br> You let me log in, i call EQ in a fit of depression, give them the station info and PW., ADMIT to sharring the account in violation of the EULA and then say " I wish this account banned" THATS IT ! They verify that you have been logged into the account and, like Daryl down at 1-888-station, MAN he LOVES to ban people, call him and ask him he will say " I love banning people".<br> Anyway, best of luck<br><p><br> OH someone asked me to clarify. Gwiz was never sold or bought on ebay. Someone gave a small fee and held the account and then sold the account thinking the origional Gwiz wouldnt come back. he sold it to Erebis/jesse/GwizWHERESMYACCOUNT! VIA email. SO dont call the poor kid a master of ebaying )</font></p>

I posted a request to speak to them about this,wich turned into one big flame, was deleted then restarted again. The NEW Gwiz, purchaser of the account, Had this to say  " Anyone who agrees with Mr.orange is a fag "<br> Would any homosexuals please come forth ?<br> Amidst sexual orientation concerns and flames in general, the guild who hides...er..houses Gwiz said basicly, we belive him,fuck off and die Mr.orange, we can sue you.. Oh well,ill chalk one up for maturity ...if i see any...someone advise me of my rights.<br> A new issue last week revolving around all of these incidents was verants log in message saying  " Sharring account info and using other peoples accounts is a violation of the EULA and appropriate actions will be taken if your caught " Becareful those people whos names i mention.....<br> And in closing i will not use a spell checker...eat my ass if you dont like it ) </font></p>

<p><font color="#990000" face="arial" size="3"><b>Oh heres a new chat...er..way to get banned )</b></font><br><font color="#ffffff" face="arial" size="1">Posted Wednesday, March 21, 2001 by <a href="mailto:mrorange@xsploitz.com">Mr.Orange</a><br><br><font color="#ffffff" face="arial" size="2"> Saw <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=570499225">this auction</a> listed on ebay while surfing<br> Not to bust anyones bubble but id like to give some info. Not to cause this guy problems or distress but to enlighten the viewer/player.<br> A few months ago verant entered a string on their side that set into motion a nice little effect. You edit an items value ( IE: nodrop to tradable) and toggle back it kicks you off of the game and im told sends info of who,when,where etc..<br> This same string also applies to GM sow X10 speed.<br> Now lets go 1 step further...this program sounds real nice but the features it deals with are all detectable. Now if your the risk taker,go for it. I, myself, will not touch it with a ten foot pole.<br> I wish the guy luck, the screen shots make it appear to be easy to opperate. but i dont want to blow 2 years of work on editing parts of the game that are visably detectable as well as able to be monitored by Verant. Yes thier client side edits BUT when you use them the info goes server side...why did noone figure that part out ?  I dunno maybe its one of those " shhhh,dotn talk about it, half truth is still the truth "<br> best of luck</font></p>
