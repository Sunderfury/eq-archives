                A questions was asked earlier today on the GamePlay forum regarding making EQ more Fun, or that the game is no longer fun.  Of course this brings up a nice conversation as to who do you listen to when creating a game so that the majority do have fun.  OSI had a serious problem with this when every other week, they would listen to a different player base, thus altering Ultima Online to meet that particular groups interest, only to anger another group. The circle was endless trying to keep everyone happy.<br><br>We know as with everything else in life, there is no way to keep everyone happy. Heck, the more people you get into a game environment, the more likely someone will be unhappy with something.  Yet another disadvantage to the world of Multiplayer Online games.<br><br>With single player games, if you don't like it, you either return it or throw it away. Now with ever living worlds, you must continually maintain happiness with your player base without knowing what direction it may go in. Even as society alters our views, a development team must plan for that change in players opinions about what is fun.<br><br>I would hope that Verant wouldn't have to continuously focus on whether or not the players are having fun, that is a good thing, and they should continue doing what they are doing, but instead, I would hope that as players we could realize that being only a game, these worlds are created for us to escape from our every day lives and by getting away from it all, would be pleasure enough to keep playing the game.<br>Gordon had these words to say about making games fun.<br><blockquote><font color="maroon"><b>"A Game is Supposed to be Fun"</b><br>Though I realize that this post is rhetorical in nature, I would be intrigued if you could post a definition of "fun" that everyone playing the game can agree upon. The perception of "fun" is entirely subjective, meaning that it is different from each persons point of view. Some things that one person finds "fun" might be seen as "boring" or "frustrating" to another. Some people's idea of "fun" is directly in conflict with other people's ideas. <br><br>It's our job as game designers to try and provide an environment where the greatest number of people possible can have fun. <br><br>We certainly won't be able to please everyone in these regards, nor would we want to. For instance, there are some people in the online world who can only have "fun" if they are allowed to ruin the "fun" of others. We don't aim to cater to that player-type. <br><br>There are many types of "fun" that we provide and allow players the opportunity to take part in, and our subscription numbers show that we must be doing something right.</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                Gordon hit several topics today on the GamePlay forums. Here are just a few of his comments.<br><blockquote><font color="maroon"><b>Fleshy Orb</b><br>Our test department checks these boards and have apparently identified the issue. Basically one of the zones that needed to be updated to get this quest working completely didn't get updated in the patch before last. Last week's patch didn't update any zone-data, so we should catch this in the next patch.<br><br><b>Poison Status</b><br>Hopefully this next patch assuming the test department signs off on it. There's still one coding bug that we need to solve before that will happen, but hopefully we can take care of it quicky. <br><br><b>Invalid Accounts</b><br>Your account is still valid, you just need to resubscribe via the accounts section of the game login. You don't have to create a "new" account.<br><br><b>Quest Items</b><br>Though I'm not aware of any specific quests that have been changed up there, there is an ongoing plan to revisit the stats on the quest items, which may very well lead to the quests themselves being revamped. If a quest has been changed, it's very likely that items that were components for those quests might be removed or replaced with new items.

If you have any additional knowledge on the below information, or if you have an unique problem you have experienced yourself, email it in, so we can get it fixed.<br><br><b>A bug with the Enchanter spell Blur which seems to have no lvl cap.</b><br><blockquote><font color="maroon">1:  We're aware of it.  It occurs due to the fact that memory-blur is actually considered a friendly spell in order to allow enchanters to blur their own pets.  Overall it isn't a great concern, since the maximum experience that can be garnered from any encounter is well-within the spell level cap.  In other words, a level 12 enchanter "soloing" a level 30 critter certainly isn't going to get level 30 experience from the encounter. It is however a bit cheesy regardless, so we may or may not work for a solution in the future.</blockquote></font><br><b>A way to get the mouse cursor to work after atl-ctrl-esc.</b><br><blockquote><font color="maroon">2: I've heard about this and we're looking into it as well.  It seems to work for some system configurations and not for others.  In any case, our goal has always been to stop "casual hacking", whereby people who wouldn't normally be predisposed to do such find some program on the net that makes it all-too-easy.  The people who are dead set to hack something, and view every roadblock we put up as yet another challenge to overcome, will always find a way to do something.

When an outdoor zone is exported from the tools we use to create it, the artist chooses a maximum clip plane. This setting affects how far out visibility is calculated, and can affect file size and frame rate. <br><br>2. Most old world zones were exported with a much lower number than most Kunark zones. <br><br>3. Each zone has a minimum and maximum clip plane number associated with it server side. These are the numbers you move between when you adjust the clipping plane slider in-game. <br><br>4. The slider bar is supposed to work as a percentage. In other words, in one zone if the min is 1 and the max 1000, were the slider in the center, you'd be at 500. But if the min was 1 and the max 100, say for another zone, you'd be at 50 with the slider in the middle. <br><br>Ok, so, after looking into this and checking out the screenshots referred to in this thread we were able to determine the following: <br><br>1. For some reason (we'll ask the programmer tomorrow), when rain stops, the clipping plane moves out beyond the max briefly and then settles back at the max. For example, I went to Overthere and verified what the screenshots showed: the Overthere's max clip is 1800 feet. It looked like the clip went to 2000 or so briefly when the sky was still gray and then returned to 1800 when the sky was on again. <br><br>2. Another bug (though not terribly consequential) is that depending on the max clip, the clip slider bar appears to do nothing the last 25% or so. I was in the Overthere using the clip slider and watching the clipping plane distance in feet (something that doesn't show on the normal client) and it got to the max, 1800, at around 75% of the slider bar. <br><br>Ok, so what does this all mean? And could people see farther in the past? <br><br>Possibly, yes -- we've changed the max clipping plane in zones several times. The fact that the slider bar appears to max out early, though, isn't stopping you from setting your clipping plane to the max setting server side. Neither is the rain. <br><br>A good question, though, is 'if the Overthere displays out to 2000 briefly, why isn't the max clip for the Overthere 2000?' <br><br>I agree. What we'll do is go through the zones again and make sure the max server side is really the max the zone was exported at. <br><br>Do keep this in mind, though: we cannot move the max clip beyond the clipping distance the zone was originally exported at -- the visibility data is just not there and you'll see nothing beyond that hard limit. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the old world zones had max clips between 600 and 1500 feet. In other words, East Commons will never have a clip of 1800 or 2000 like the Overthere could. <br><br>I'll also ask that the bug associated with the rain that has the cilp pull back past the max clip be fixed, although honestly, it's not going to be a high priority bug in that it doesn't hurt gameplay. <br><br>Anyway, I hope this clears things up. I'll watch this thread tonight to see if there are any additional questions. <br><br>- Brad</blockquote></font></blockquote><br>

                Well, It appears theres a strange after-patch bug that happend to me. Yesterday when I logged on, I headed off to Highpass to hopfully get my page 32 of the Testiment of Vanear. Well, when I actually opened my testiment, I noticed a jar with something in it inplace of my page 34. I right-clicked on it and noticed it said "Cinder Hornet Pollen". I then messaged a guide and he said that hes had numerous reports of this same thing happening (this is on Fennin, not sure if it happend else-where) but anyway, he left a note for a GM. When I logged on today I recived a /tell from a guide informing me that a GM told him that the pollen will still combine with Page 32. So its nothing to be worried about, just a strange glitch. Sorry that I didn't post earlier, had some ISP problems that have been happening frequently.</blockquote><br>

                Heres a look of what todays patch is going to bring:<br><br><blockquote><font color="maroon"><br>June15th, 8:00am<br>------------<br><br>*Patch Day*<br><br>Hello everyone,<br><br>Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on The Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future. Even so, a number of changes and additions were made in today's patch. Most of the changes are in regards to quests:<br><br>- The "Fleshy Orbe" quest has been completed<br>- We've received word that "Fabian" has been spotted somewhere on Norrath.<br>- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should be seen more regularly.<br>- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.<br>- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft "The Robe of the Lost Circle".<br><br>A few items have also been changed this week:<br><br>- The robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.<br>- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Galmour now have a short casting time associated with their activatable effect(See Below).<br>- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning it will disappear when you log off.(See Below)<br><br>*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*<br><br>We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these items to "spam" other players with their spell-effect messages, causing them to disconnect. Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text messages caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you to filter out spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.<br><br>The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will have to stand still to use them now.<br><br>*Gunthak Harpoon*<br><br>In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon "Rentable", meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff. Basically, one of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded that it must be a mug and took the initiative to fix it. Unfortunantly, the stats on this weapon, dispite its disadvantages of weight and its non-magical composition, make it much too powerful for its location and difficulty in obtaining it.<br><br>For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear the next time taht you log out. This is a retroactive change and will affect weapons already in possession. WE do apologize to those who aquired it within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent weapon.<br><br>*Chat/Login Process*<br><br>The Chat and Login server components are now completely seperate, meaning that players who no longer have difficulty logging in due to an excess of players in the chat server.<br><br>-The EverQuest Team<br></blockquote></font><br><br>Well, good changes, and hopefully we will have The Hole added to the game soon. Well, thats it for now.</blockquote><br>

                It looks like we are good to go.  The Everquest page is up, and a few announcements are out.  I've contacted the EQ Team in hopes of patching up some communication issues of the past, and I look forward to seeing what we can do for the team now.<br><br>Of course, I can't do this alone. I'm looking for dedicated help.  There are some positions open around the network, and on this site. Looking for a site admin to handle the daily operations of news for EQ as well as a few news reporters to go out and research the daily happenings.<br><br>I'm also looking for individuals who may simply be interested in expressing opinions in a weekly column, moderating the message forums, or just compiling screenshots.<br><br>If you are interested in any of the above, feel free to email me as soon as your ready.<br><br>In addition, I'm looking for updated information for character guides, map locations, spell database information, and skill info. We are now tracking developer's comments, so if you see a member of the EQ team post something, send me the link so we can have it archived.<br><br>The Bug Database will start a new. This time tracking the status of each bug in hopes to have the problems resolved as soon as possible.  There is no time line on getting the bug fixed, and there is no public display in regards to steps to duplicate the bug. Just a database with daily problems you encounter and a means by which the developers can track and fix them.<br><br>Once again, if you are interested in helping out, email me and we can see where you could fit in.</blockquote><br>

                An old friend of the network, Buur from <a href="http://www.eqrants.net" class="link2">EQ Rants</a>, was able to take a few minutes and sit down with Gordon Wrinn for a quick Q&A session on what's what in EQ. <br><blockquote><font color="maroon">"Seriously though, we are sincerely aiming to please the largest percentage of our playerbase possible by keeping the game fun and interesting for them.  Though it may appear to some that our intentions are "evil", it wouldn't make much sense for us as a company to purposely alienate our customers.  The numbers, particularly the ones that show EQ's ability to retain subscribers, and the ones that show EQ's subscribers gladly recommending the game to others, clearly show that we must be doing *something* right. People may disagree on exactly what that *something* is, and most would agree that EQ isn't perfect, but in the end, the people are here, play the game nearly every day, and enjoy the heck out of it."</font></blockquote><br>For the complete log, visit <a href="http://www.eqrants.net" class="link2">EQ Rants</a>.<br>  </blockquote><br>
