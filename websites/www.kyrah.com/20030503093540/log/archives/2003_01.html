Today's Patch Message
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
The Pacify spells have been fixed in this patch, no longer giving a "did not take hold" message. Most other changes revolved around NPC bugs and character creation issues. Click below to see the full patch message.
</div>



<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="7" width="7"><br>
<div align="justify">
** Gameplay and User Interface **<br><br>

- Further optimizations to reduce bandwidth and 'lag'. It is difficult to describe the value of this change, but it should show a noticeable improvement for many. We've also resolved many of the hit point update and movement issues that occurred recently.<br>
- Made an improvement to the animation code that may reduce the slight delays that can occur when a new player enters a zone.<br>
- Spells on spell! book pages 33 to 50 can now be deleted for those who were having troubles.<br>
- Corrected a bug that could cause a crash if a character tried to purchase an item or close the merchant window just as he was leaving the trading range of that merchant.<br>
- Players should no longer get out of range message when trying to target a player on a horse just because the horse has moved a little (but is still in range).<br>
- Corrected an issue in Fungus Grove that was allowing some ranged attacks to land unnoticed by NPCs.<br><br>


** Spells **<br><br>

- Lull, Soothe, Calm, Pacify, Harmony, Calm Animal, and Rest the Dead should no longer give the: "Your spell did not take hold," message.<br>
- Bard Songs with a "Rune" component should be working properly.<br>
- Sha's Advantage and Savagery are now available on vendors in the Plane ! of Knowledge.<br>
- Illusion spells used with Luclin models should now show the appropriate hair.<br>
- Infusion of Spirit should no longer overwrite Speed of Vallon.<br>
- Sense Summoned will now sense elementals of most types.<br>
- Eye of Zomm and Stalking Probe cast from a horse will now be able to look up and down.<br>
- Call of Rizlona now has casting text for the person that procs this spell.<br><br>


** Alternate Advancement **<br><br>

- Monk discipline Resistance should increase resistances properly now.<br>
- The Shaman AA ability Spirit Call should now finish casting if you regain concentration after interruption.<br>
- Corrected a problem where right-clicking on an AA hotkey would highlight the wrong ability on the list in the window.<br>
- There will now be a confirmation window available when spending AA points. There is a new selection in the Options menu called Fast AA Purchase for toggling this confirmation.<br><br>


** Items **<br><br>

- Spirit of Snow and Spirit of Flame will be dropping more frequently now.<br>
- Merchant's Crate of Supplies will now fit into containers that can hold giant-sized items.<br>
- Removed Paladin and Ranger from the list of characters that could use the Hateful Balanced Zweihander. It is only usable by worshippers of Innoruuk, and was never meant to be used by these classes.<br>
- The Resplendent War Maul now has a more appropriate inventory icon.<br>
- Crypt Master's Conjuring Stone is now more valuable to NPC vendors, and they will not sell it as cheaply as they did in the past.<br><br>


** Quests **<br><br>

- Killing Kazen Fecae is no longer a viable path to the completion of the Necromancer Epic quest.<br>
- Tibrinn Ember now gives a faction modifier for the completion of his quest.<br>
- Hanns Krieghor will no longer grant faction increases just by talking to him.<br>
- There are now a few Iksar in the Plane of Knowledge that are interested in your Iksar racial armor.<br><br>


** Bazaar **<br><br>

- Corrected a bug in the Bazaar that caused price changes made by traders to only affect one stack of the same item.<br>
- Target Group Buff and the AA ability Mass Group Buff can no longer be used with levitate spells to push traders out of their stalls in the Bazaar.<br><br>


** NPCs **<br><br>

- The specters and shades in Velketor should no longer be dropping cloth armor.<br>
- Centi Dators should no longer spawn inside walls.<br>
- Oozing Flesh in the Tower of Frozen Shadow should no longer drop Sabretooth hides. It was determined that these creatures are too slow to catch a Sabretooth, and that they do not have the ability to skin them nor the desire to wear (or eat) their hides.<br>
- Elder Spiritualist Grawleh will now respond properly to hails.<br>
- Fittorin Bladespur will now respond properly to hails.<br>

- Corrected the models for elementals in the Plane of Earth.<br>
- NPCs in the "pit" area of Plane of Tactics will now respawn properly.<br>
- Removed Sarnak Slaves from Nurga, since they had no models there to use and looked like the base model human (Doug).<br><br>


** Character Appearance **<br><br>

- The bald head can now be selected during character creation by clicking the left arrow button (was only available by clicking the right arrow).<br>
- Beard color selection now works for dark elf male, high elf male, half elf male, and dwarf female during the creation of new characters. Note: Dwarf female only has one style of beard.<br>
- The ability to pick a wode is now available at character creation for Barbarians.<br>
- Choosing the "random" button at character creation will now randomly choose a face rather than always using the initial selection.<br>

The Legacy of Ykesha
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
The Legacy of Ykesha will be the first download-only extension for EverQuest. This product will not be available in stores. This extension will include some great new gameplay features, as well as new zones for characters ranging from level 35 up to level 60. Legacy of Ykesha Features include: A new playable race: Frogloks, Enhanced Looking For Group Tool, New Cartography System, New Magic Item slot: Charms, Armor Dyes, Dozens of new creatures, Expanded bank capacity, New zones, New spells. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.legacyofykesha.com" target="new">www.legacyofykesha.com</a>. Along with introducing this upcoming expansion, the patch today included a new "story window" and fixed a pile of bugs as usual :) To see the full message click below.
</div>



<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="7" width="7"><br>
<div align="justify">
** Gameplay/Features **<br><br>

- With our last patch and the patch today, we've significantly reduced the amount of bandwidth that EverQuest needs to use, even in large raid or extremely-crowded-zone situations.<br>
- Fixed a problem with tints not properly updating when armor is removed.<br>
- Fixed a bug with character faces displaying incorrectly to other players when you zone in after them.<br>
- Fixed resurrection timer that was counting down against the 3 hour limit when player was not logged in.<br>
- Corrected a problem with health and movement updates being delayed.<br><br>


** Spells **<br><br>

- NPCs will now notice Druid and Shaman Percentage Heal spells in a manner similar to traditional healing spells.<br>
- Removed the chance for slow spells to be reversed from the 17 NPCs that had this ability.<br>
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Curses, Diseases, and Poisons from being removed.<br>
- Raised all recast times below 2.25 seconds up to 2.25 seconds. This is a change in the spell data as the first part of a two-part change needed to correct the "Recast time not met" problem. More information is available at the Developer's Corner at www.everquest.com.<br><br>


** Alternate Advancement/Special Abilities **<br><br>

- The range on the Bard Ability "Boastful Bellow" has been increased slightly.<br>
- Fixed a bug with Harm Touch that was not allowing it to increase the standard amount per level over level 60.<br><br>


** User Interface **<br><br>

- Fixed a bug with effects in the Songs window. They were not getting removed on the client when the bard was dispelled.<br>
- Introduced new Story window. The purpose of this window is to provide story updates in a readily available location. ALT-N toggles the window. You can select to have the window pop up when new story elements are added if you wish.<br>
- Item Links are once again creatable from Items and from other Item Links. Please do not attempt to "mine" the servers for undiscovered items. Links now have a built-in mechanism to prevent those who would go on fishing expeditions by sending up many bad links in an attempt to discover new items. These invalid links are logged, as are the accounts of those who create them.<br>
- Added an optional confirmation box before spending AA points. To turn on this confirmation box, please check the Options window.<br><br>


** Miscellaneous **<br><br>

- Sage Quests in Plane of Knowledge have been fixed.<br>
- The event to fight Bertoxxulous in the Crypt of Decay will reset 4 to 6 hours after the event is failed. It will respawn normally if the event is won.<br><br>


** New/Changed Interface Files **<br><br>

- EQUI_StoryWnd.xml (actually added with the Jan. 9th patch)<br>
- EQUI_OptionsWnd.xml

Today's Patch Message
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
Lots of downtime today for the scheduled patch, but looks like it may be well worth it :) The game can now be played in window format (previously a bannable offense), allowing for some multi-tasking while playing. This has obliterated the use of EQ's classic interface however, for those who still preferred it. A song buff box has been added in, which allows players a max of 21 effects (up to 15 regular buffs, 6 songs). Drop rates on parchments and runes in third tier planes have been significantly increased. Most other changes revolve around minor fixes and addressing flag progression. Click the link below to see the full message.
</div>



<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="7" width="7"><br>
<div align="justify">
** Demise of the Classic/Velious Interface **<br><br>

Over the last six months we have been keeping the Classic EverQuest interface as well as the Velious interface working through all of the features that we have added (built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, enhanced /bug reporting tool, and others). However, with the release of some of the new features in this patch, such as running EQ in a window, we must now say goodbye to the older interfaces. They have been disabled as of today.<br><br>

They served us well.<br><br>

** EQ in a Window **<br><br>

EverQuest can now be run in a window. To place EverQuest in a window, simply press Alt-Enter. You can also switch out of EverQuest to another program by using the familiar Alt-Tab. It is important that you do not do this until you are in-game, do not do this during the login process.<br><br>

It is important to note a few things. Running the game in a window may reduce game performance a bit. And, as always, the more programs you have running at the same time the more resources they use.<br><br>

At this time, due to some changes that need to be made on the front end, it is not possible to run two instances of EverQuest. We will be working to make the necessary changes over the next few weeks.<br><br>

** Songs Window **<br><br>

We have added a new window to the interface along with new game functionality. The Songs window is a new buff window that holds up to 6 bard song buffs. This increases the potential maximum effects that a character can have to 21 (15 standard and the 6 new ones). The new window only holds certain bard songs (generally the 3-tick songs). Only beneficial songs will qualify for the new buff box, and not all of those. Any buff in the new Songs window is considered temporary and will not be saved when you zone.<br><br>

Songs that qualify to go into the new window will go into that window first. Any qualifying songs over six will be rerouted to the main Effects window. Cancel Magic effects will see these new buff slots as buff slots #16-21.<br><br>

Note for User Interface skin creators: The Label EQTypes 80-85 are the Songs window song names.<br><br>

- Some magical effects on Planar class armor have been altered. In most cases the effects were upgraded, but a few items were given weaker effects that were more in line with the difficulty of obtaining them.<br>
- Fixed a bug that was causing a few Planes of Power NPCs to take too long to respawn.<br>
- Wu's Attack should now work correctly.<br>
- Incoming damage now interacts with Wrath of the Wild and other rune-type spells in their proper order.<br>
- Pact of Shadow and Shadow Compact will once again heal player characters.<br>
- Charmed Pets will no longer remain charmed after the owner dies.<br>
- Sending special characters (such as < and ") via EQIM will no longer freeze the game.<br>
- Hitting Autoattack when in explore mode at Character Select will no longer cause the game to crash.<br>
- The Loadskin window will now load skins other than the default properly.<br>
- Fixed and issue that caused some NPC's text to be cut short.<br>
- Fixed (but did not rename) the Broken Golem. He should no longer be hated in Fear, just feared...<br>
- Lowered the duration of calm-type spells that effect creatures level 50 and over.<br><br>

** Zones **<br><br>

- Spectral Parchments, Ethereal Parchments, and Glyphed Rune word drops have been increased significantly in the third tier Planes of Power zones.<br>
- The trials within the Halls of Honor have been changed slightly. Please proceed with caution.<br>
- Several Planes of Power NPCs are no longer angered quite as badly when they notice a healing spell being cast on a player they are angry with.<br>
- Made improvements to the Planes of Power quest armors.<br>
- Assorted quest, item, and dialogue fixes.<br><br>

** Planes of Power Zone Progression **<br><br>

As most know, progressing through Planes of Power zones requires that certain tasks be performed. In many cases, one of the tasks required involves being on a raid that defeats a particularly powerful foe.<br><br>

One side effect of this progress is that if the tasks were not accomplished in a particular order, a person on a raid may not gain the flag for completing the event, as they did not complete the prerequisite tasks.<br><br>

The majority of "zone boss" style encounters in the first three tiers of Planes of Power zones have been changed to alleviate this problem of completing tasks out of order.<br><br>

As of today, if you defeat one of these foes and do not have all of the prerequisites completed to receive the flag at the end of the event, you will be able to go back and complete the tasks that you have not yet performed.<br><br>

Once you've done that, you may speak with the Seer in the Plane of Knowledge who will make sure that you are then able to progress as if you had performed the tasks in their proper order.

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
Wow, December was a busy month for me. I started raiding again and working on long key camps, leaving little time to make updates. On the bright side, this motivated me to add one of those painful key quests to the listing here :) I think that my next task will be to expand the spell information to include mana cost, casting time, etc. But we'll see how quickly that happens :P
