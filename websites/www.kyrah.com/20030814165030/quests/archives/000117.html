This quest begins in Akheva, bring a group with you. Just past Itraer Vius' room is a large gate (hard to miss, look for the bars). Pull the shade on the right side, then hug the right wall, clearing any mobs along the way till you stand before a set of steps. Go up and kill the 4 mobs, then drop down to a small platform below. You are looking for a "Shimmering Presence" but if it's not up, start killing the "Sacrificed Remains" until it pops.<br><br>

A shimmering presence's voice invades your mind.<br>
"Shadows can not exist without light. Bring me a wisp stone so that my balance can be righted by their soft glow."<br><br>

Wisp stones are a level 4 item summoned by mages. Hand it in to the Shimmering Presence and The Spirit of Akelha`Ra will spawn.<br><br>

You say, "Hail, The Spirit of Akelha`Ra"<br>
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra 's hollow eyes look up at you. You have the distinct impression that she can see right into the darkest shadows of your soul. She opens her mouth to speak but the sounds you hear come from inside your mind. "Greetings mortal, thank you for releasing me from my [tormented prison]."<br><br>

You say, "what tormented prison?"<br>
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra appears to be fading in and out of existence as you speak to her. The spirit's voice fills your mind. "I am Akelha`Ra, once high priestess of Luclin and leader of the Akheva. This form you see before you now is a fading remnant of my former existence. The storm was the cause of my imprisonment in the world of undying [spirits]."<br><br>

You say, "what spirits?"<br>
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says, "We Akheva are immortal entities placed in this plane by the mistrees of shadow. We are her most perfect creation. Death has no meaning to us, as even in death we find rebirth through the power of the mistress. My imprisonment was caused by my seperation from the power of the mistress by [Atenha`Ra]. It was she who sent the storm to destroy me and all that followed me."<br><br>

You say, "who is Atenha`Ra?"<br> 
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says, "It is more then a little ironic that Atenha`Ra is a reflection of myself. An entity created from my own consciousness, a reflection of a shadow. She now holds the seat of grand power in [Vex Thal], and I have not the power to gain entry to the city, let alone face her. You must find my scepter that was lost in the storm to gain entry to Vex Thal. The scepter has likely lost much of it's power from being shattered. Once it is reassembled you will need to merge a Orb of Luclinite with a source of celestial power inside the scepter. The spirits whisper that the emperor of the Shissar holds the power to manipulate such energy. Be weary of him, he is heralded as the slayer of gods, the defiler of realities."<br><br>

You say, "what is Vex Thal?"<br>
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra says, "Vex Thal is the sacred home of the Akheva. The place where Luclin's power directly touches this world...ungh... I can not summon the frame of my scepter in my current weakened state. I need a soul to regain my pow..." As she speaks you can see her slowly fade out of existence. You wonder how long her spirit will stay with this world. She seems entirely unable to speak to you now, and can only muster the strength to point at the ground at Kyrah's feet. Kyrah reaches down a picks up a small emerald off the ground, but it disappears silently into the shadows. Akelha`ra looks as if she is trying to speak again.<br><br>

Akelha`ra needs an Essence Emerald (necro rez component). Hand it to her to receive the Scepter Frame (container).<br><br>

You say, "what frame of your scepter?"<br>
The Spirit of Akelha`Ra opens her mouth to speak, but the voice in your head is no longer audible. You reach forward to touch the fading shadow of a creature and draw back in horror as your hand disrupts the spirit before you. She evaporates into the shadows once more.<br><br>

You will now need 10 lucid shards from all over Luclin.<br><br>

1) Acrylia -- Drops from Grimling Skullcrackers and Runed  Skullcrackers at the city gates<br><br>

2) Ahkeva -- Drops from various MoBs (mainly rocks and shrouded types) near Va'Dyn and Itraer Vius rooms<br><br>

3) Dawnshroud -- Drops from Rockhoppers and Sambatas in their cave<br><br>

4) The Deep -- Drops from various Thought Horrors and Leeches past the bridge<br><br>

5) Fungus Grove -- Drops from the Shik`Nar Warriors and Royals in their cave (back of zone)<br><br>

6) The Grey -- Drops from Sun Reverants (northeastern corner around pond) and named Rockfiends<br><br>

7) Maiden's Eye -- Drops from named Goranga (rarest shard)<br><br>

8) Sanctus Seru -- Drops from Legionnaires most commonly on the skywalk (teleport pad up to it)<br><br>

9) Scarlet Desert -- Drops from Sun Reverants or Reavers, most commonly on the plateau camp<br><br>

10) Ssraeshza Temple -- Drops from skeletons in the mine area<br><br>

Combine all 10 together in the Scepter Frame. Your reassembled scepter will still be a container, but now with only 2 slots. The final combine requires a "Glowing Orb of Luclinite" from any Luclin boss mob and a "Celestial Rift" which is acquired by killing the MoBs that spawn upon Emperor Ssraeshza's death (this means, you first need your Shissar Key). The combined result will be "The Sceptor of Shadows" which is your key into Vex Thal.
