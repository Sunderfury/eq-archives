	As you can see the site has a new format for better organization and navigation. The spell listing has been updated and corrected, the flowing thought listings are now current, and a few of the other older sections have been changed around.

	A couple more quests added to the menu regarding the Planes of Power ornate molds. By the way, couldn't find the stats for the Elemental BP anywhere, so I'd appreciate an email if anyone happens to know!

 &nbsp;--&nbsp; Pile of Updates!
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
	Today's patch implimented the ability for any caster with the research skill to also be able to research priest spells (ones that would normally be MoB dropped only), as also explained at <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=54405" target="new">this link</a> from the developer corner on EQ's official website. I have added a chart to the library section with recipes for these combines. Also added to the library is a listing of cleric VT loot (maybe this should be under equip? but I didn't feel like rearranging!). A few more quests have been added, including the second cleric spell quest for Pure Blood. Lastly, a few more levels are now included in the updated spell database. If you'd like to see the full patch message for today, skip down to the more link below updated pages :)

 &nbsp;--&nbsp; Spell Section Updates
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
	Continuing to work on the new spell listing, added a new section to the library on spell components, and improving the forum (which now has a new layout since I lost the first). Information on LoY seems to be trickling in pretty slowly, charms especially are still quite an enigma to most.

 &nbsp;--&nbsp; New Spell Quest Found
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
	Posted quest information for the new level 44 cleric spell Temperance. I have a few additional notes to mention however. Firstly, the NPC will -only- respond to clerics, which is good since the spell is -no drop- :) This is a buff spell, offering an additional 800 hp and 48 ac to your target. The mana cost is 550 per cast, and lasts 1 hour and 40 minutes. These specifics will be added into the spell listing soon. I am currently re-formatting the spell section, which you can check out below (only up to lvl 24 prepared so far).

 &nbsp;--&nbsp; Today's Tiny Update
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
	I looked over my quest listing and wondered how I could have left out the J-Boots quest. Perhaps some bad memories of that eternal camp? :P Well they aren't as sought now that alternative advancement includes a similiar enhancement, but J-Boots are still quite an asset to those under 51.

 &nbsp;--&nbsp; New Spells? New Forum!
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
	There's been some buzzing around the cleric community of new researched cleric spells, combined by necros, though I haven't seen anything comfirmed yet. Soon as I do, information will be added in! Apparently there are a couple new quested spells as well, which I'm currently looking into. In my spare time I have also configured a new forum system... which will require all old members to sign up again. Sorry bout that, but this board seems a lot more customizable which I was desperately seeking! The link to the new URL is up top in the menu.
