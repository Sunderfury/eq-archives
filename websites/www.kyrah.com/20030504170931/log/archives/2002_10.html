New PoP Focus Spells
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
Two new spells have been added for level 19 and 39 clerics, both found in the Plane of Knowledge. These are "focus" spells that speed up casting by 10% with a few exceptions, such as the obvious, Complete Healing :\ I've added these to the spell listing and also expanded the library section of the site with more game commands. There's getting to be quite a lot to remember!

Planes of Power Live
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
The Planes of Power expansion is officially available in stores today, though some say it hasn't been easy to find. I'll be updating the spell listing tonight for over level 60. The raid commands have also been introduced, you can view them all by clicking the link below. PoP *IS* required to use the raid commands.
</div>



<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="7" width="7"><br>
<div align="justify">
<b>Planes of Power is now Live</b><br><br>

Welcome to the Planes of Power. Of course, if you haven't purchased the expansion you can do so at our online store at www.everquest.com. If you have, prepare for adventure beyond Norrath and into the realm of the gods. We hope you have fun.<br><br>

One of the new features included in the Planes of Power is a new way for NPCs deal with Player Characters. It allows NPCs to recognize certain actions taken by player characters. This may mean that an NPC will not be interested in talking to you until you've accomplished a certain task or until certain events have occurred. So some NPCs may not have much to say to you upon your first meeting, but might be more talkative later. This can also apply to events and locations that might react differently to a character that has accomplished a task than to one that has not.<br><br>

<b>Important Notice about unspent Alternate Advancement points</b><br><br>

With this patch any character with more than 30 unspent AA points will have those points deleted when they log in.<br><br>

<b>Patch Information</b><br><br>

Reduced the maximum NPC level that Harmony can affect<br>
Fixed a bug with the bard epic effect and singing stacking<br><br>
 
<b>Raids</b><br><br>

The Raid functionality has been added. Here is a brief overview of the Raid system.<br><br>

In the past, experience on raids would generally go to a single group or a few groups. The group doing the most damage would get the experience on any given kill. But, that has been changed by a new Raid feature.<br><br>

The Raid system is intended to aid in the formation and organizing raids and make looting on raids a little more manageable. It allows a certain amount of experience to be shared among all members of a raid. The basics of the system work very much like grouping has always worked. The Raid Leader is the leader of all the raid groups and the group leaders remain leaders of their individual groups.<br><br>

Alt-R or /raidwindow will toggle the new Raid Window. This window works much like the group window. You can invite people to the raid (if you are the raid leader) and see a list of the folks in your raid, along with the status of those members (Raid Leader, Group Leader or raid member - which shows with no rank). It also shows you the group number of the individual members.<br><br>

Only Raid Leaders and Raid Group Leaders can invite people to a raid. This is done with the Invite button on the raid window.<br><br>

If a Raid Leader invites an individual (someone not in a group), that person joins the raid as a Raid Group Leader. If the Raid Leader invites a member of a group, the entire group joins the raid, and their group leader becomes a Raid Group Leader.<br><br>

A Raid Group Leader can invite people to their group, thus inviting them to join the raid group as well.<br><br>

Only a Raid Leader can remove someone from the raid. He or she does so simply by clicking on the character's name in the raid window and clicking the Disband button (also in the raid window).<br><br>

Being removed from your group (using the normal grouping features) will not remove you from the raid.<br><br>

You can remove yourself from the raid just by clicking the Disband button in the raid window.<br><br>

Just like groups, raids have their own chat channel. /rsay works for the raid just as /gsay does for groups. Just like group chat, you can set this to be your default channel for a given chat window by choosing it from the right-click Default Channel context menu.<br><br>

Experience for killing NPCs will be distributed to all members of the raid that are within range. However, the experience given will be smaller than the experience that would be earned by a single group. Generally, unless you are fighting NPCs that require a raid, you will still be better off earning experience with the old fashioned six-person group.<br><br>

Raids will definitely allow for larger than traditional groups, however, much of EverQuest is designed with the six-person group in mind. Adding a small number of people to a given group will allow this "oversized" group to gain experience. However, we recommend that once a "raid" of ten or more people forms, a second, traditional group split off and adventure on their own.<br><br>

The Raid Leader determines the looting permissions for any NPC killed by the raid. There are three types of looting that the leader can choose from (though the Raid Leader can always loot NPCs killed by the raid).<br><br>

1. Only the raid leader can loot until the corpse opens up for all<br><br>

2. Only the raid leader and raid group leaders can loot until the corpse opens up<br><br>

3. Raid leader chooses up to 9 other raid members that can loot until the corpse opens up<br><br>

Please note that altering loot permissions only applies to NPCs that are killed after changing this setting. See the command list below for more information about setting raid loot permissions.<br><br>

When an item is looted by a raid member, a loot message is sent to all members of the raid.<br><br>

<b>Summary of Raid Commands:</b><br><br>

- /raidwindow - toggles the raid window<br><br>

- /makeraidleader [name]- reassigns raid leadership - Optional argument, name of raid member to be new leader, or you can just target them. If you type a person's name, that name is used instead of your current raid window target.<br><br>

- /raidinvite - invites the current target to the raid<br><br>

- /raidaccept - accepts an invitation to a raid<br><br>

- /raiddecline - declines an invitation to a raid<br><br>

- /raidremove - removed the current raid target from the raid<br><br>

- /setloottype <#> - sets the raid loot type - Takes one number argument: 1, 2, 3<br><br>

- /addraidlooter - adds a raid member as an early looter to all future corpses - Target a raid member in raid window<br><br>

- /removeraidlooter - removes a raid member as a possible looter from all future corpses - Target a raid member in raid window<br><br>

- /rsay - Sends a message to all members of the raid

Today's Patch Message
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
Due to a few AA alterations, Verant has refunded some AAXP skills. Those that may affect clerics are Innate Regeneration and Mental Clarity, so when you log on make sure to re-spend those points if you still want these abilities. The Divine Ressurrection skill timer has changed from 72 hour recast to 36 hours. The Complete Heal change to 7.5k HP is now in effect. Mod Rod spell changed to a AOE type of spell, giving rods to all players within range of the magician. They still have 3 charges but can only be cast once per 5 minutes. In an attempt to balance encounters with the new Mod Rods, Verant has shortened the length of some Luclin fights. Alarm Cloak feature integrated with new UI, once set it will go off regardless of character or server you may switch to during your session. For the complete patch message, click the link below!

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="7" width="7"><br>
<div align="justify">
** Odd New Objects in the Land **<br><br>

Folks across Norrath and on Luclin have reported seeing odd new objects in various locations.  They appear to be some sort of magical portal, though local spell casters have yet to discover how they arrived or exactly what their purpose is.  They have determined, however, that these objects are slowly building in power.  Attempting to use these portals at this time can have unexpected results.  Experts recommend that adventurers avoid these objects until they know more.  For more information on these odd devices, visit <a href="http://www.planesofpower.com" target="new">www.planesofpower.com</a><br><br>


** Important Notice Regarding Alternate Advancement Reimbursement **<br><br>

Due to the changes made to Manaburn, Rods of Mystical Transvergence and a previous change to Innate Regeneration, we are reimbursing several Alternate Advancement (AA) abilities. <br><br>

Once you log in today, if you have any of these abilities, please check your AA window immediately!   If you have more than 30 unspent points, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT that you make certain that your character has 30 or fewer AA points before  The Planes of Power launches on October 21st! The return of these AA points may put your total number of unspent points over the 30 point maximum. Your pool will be reduced to 30 the first time you log in after the launch of Planes of Power on October 21st.<br><br>

We will be refunding all Alternate Advancement points in the following abilities:<br><br>

Innate Regeneration<br>
Manaburn<br>
Mental Clarity<br>
Quick Summoning<br><br>

Refunded Alternate Advancement points may be spent in any way you choose.  None of these abilities is being removed, and of them only Manaburn is changing.<br><br>

NOTE:  Cannibalization, Gather Mana, and Mind and Body Rejuvenation will not function if you do not have the necessary prerequisite, Mental Clarity 3.<br><br>


** Alternate Advancement **<br><br>

- Mana Burn will only land any given target only once every minute.  If a cast of Mana Burn is unable to land, the timer will not be used.<br>
- Spell Casting Mastery once again works in the same manner that it did before the previous patch<br>
- Spell Casting Fury and Soul Abrasion will now stack<br>
- Illusion Tree and Minor Illusion will no longer be affected by Permanent Illusion<br>
- Fixed Purify Soul.  It should now cure poison, disease, damage over time spells as initially intended<br>
- Reduced the reuse timer on Divine Resurrection from 72 hours to 36 hours<br>
- Reduced the reuse timer on Mend Companion from 144 minutes to 36 minutes<br>
- Reduced the reuse timer of Warcry from 72 minutes to 36 minutes.  Increased its duration from 5 seconds per rank of the ability to 10 seconds per rank of the ability<br><br>


** Defensive Changes **<br><br>

- Decreased Monks' ability to mitigate damage (please see the Developer's Update on www.everquestlive.com for more details)<br>
- Improved the ability of Paladins, Shadowknights, Warriors and Bards to mitigate damage in some situations<br>
- Upgraded Warrior dodge cap to 190<br>
- Upgraded Paladin, Shadowknight and Bard dodge cap to 170<br>
- Upgraded Ranger and Beastlord dodge to 170 and defense to 240<br><br>


** Spells **<br><br>

- Complete Healing will now heal a maximum of 7,500 hit points<br>
- The Rod of Mystical Transvergence spell has been altered.  The spell has been renamed to "Mass Mystical Transvergence".  When cast, this spell summons a Rod of Mystical Transvergence for everyone within 300 feet.  This rod is no drop and contains 3 charges of Mystical Transvergence.  Each charge restores 360 mana at the cost of 450 health.  A player may only use a charge from the rod once every 5 minutes.<br>
- Additionally, there is a new "Rod of Mystical Transvergence" spell for sale in the Bazaar.  This is a single target spell that summons a rod with 3 charges of Mystical Transvergence.  This rod has the same abilities and restrictions listed above.  This spell is a targeted summon that costs 400 points of mana to cast.<br>
- Changed the way Focus stacks with other strength and dexterity buffs<br>
- Circle of Seasons will overwrite Resist Cold<br>
- Dance of the Blade should now stack with McVaxius's Rousing Rondo<br>
- Harness of Spirit and Rage should now stack properly<br>
- Fufil's Curtailing Chant should now stack with Occlusion of Sound<br>
- Protection of the Glades should now overwrite Blessed Armor of the Risen<br>
- Blessed Armor of the Risen should now stack with Lunar Whispers<br>
- Fixed a bug that was causing some applications of spells and ranged attacks from great distance to go unnoticed by NPCs<br>
- Contact Innates (such as Boon of the Garou) should now be working for bards<br>
- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause helmets and sometimes hair to disappear after an illusion was cast<br>
- Bard songs should now blink on recipients other than the bard<br><br>


** Encounters **<br><br>

Due to the number of Luclin encounters requiring original Rods of Transvergence to be defeated by a reasonably sized force, a number of those encounters have been be re-tuned to shorten their duration.<br><br>


** Interface **<br><br>

- New Alarm feature added.  When you first log in you will see a pop up asking if you wish to set an alarm and if so for how long.  There is also an option to choose to never see that pop up again.  If you choose this option you will need to set ShowAlarmWindow=TRUE in your eqclient.ini file in order to see the pop up again.  The alarm will trigger after the time you set has elapsed, no matter what character you are playing on whatever server, up until the moment you log out.<br>
- /played now displays how long you have been playing this session and, if an alarm has been set, how long until that alarm sounds.<br>
- /pet sit down should now work on charmed NPCs<br>
- Added 3 new context menu options for chat windows: Reply To, Tell a friend, Tell a Raidmember (for future use).  Each of which has a submenu containing the list of Reply targets, Friends, or Raidmembers, as appropriate.  Clicking on the player's name will place "/tell <name>" on the chat entry line, and move the focus there, closing the menu.<br>
- Changed /loadskin.  It now brings up a window that will allow you to select a skin from a list, determine whether to use the INI or not, then load the skin.<br><br>


** Beastlords **<br><br>

In order to allow us to better tune warders, we have made changes to the way that these pets work.  Previously a Beastlord would summon a pet using an ability button and then use level-appropriate buff spells to increase the pet's level.  Because of the way this mechanic works, it was very difficult to tune these pets.   Hopefully this will have the side benefit of making things a little easier on Beastlords by reducing the number of steps required to cast the pet.<br><br>

Beastlords will now summon their pets using spells rather than an ability.  The series of spells that was previously used to buff the pets will now simply summon the appropriate pet.<br><br>

Unfortunately, these pets will no longer zone with the Beastlord, and will need to be resummoned (instead of rebuffed) after zoning.<br><br>

We have made some adjustments to these pets already.<br><br>

- Added the casting time reduction that is already in place for Paladins, Rangers and Shadowknights to Beastlords<br><br>


** Items **<br><br>

- Merchants now highly value the Staff of Forbidden Rites and will only sell them at an extremely high price.<br>
- Dance of the Blade should once again stack with Nature's Melody and Song of the Deep Seas<br><br>


** Trade Skills **<br><br>

- Made it slightly easier to get skill increases while doing Tailoring, Tinkering, Smithing, Baking, Brewing and Alchemy.  Made it slightly more difficult to get skill increases with Pottery and Fletching<br><br>


** Miscellaneous **<br><br>

- Fixed an issue that was causing zones to crash in some circumstances<br>
- Fixed an issue that was causing merchants to behave erratically while handling certain quantities of items<br>
- Player Character corpses with no items will decay in 3 real life hours, not 7 days<br>
- Fixed a bug that was causing Lay Hands to not heal enough damage<br>
- Zoning while on a horse on a boat will no longer cause you to appear on the other side in the water<br>
- /face (face picker) will no longer work while under the effects of an illusion<br>
- Taunt should be more effective and more dependent on the level of the Taunt skill for PC's and NPC's below level 60.<br>
- Levitation can no longer be cast on Traders in the Bazaar<br><br>

Some Upcoming Changes
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
Starting October 16th, corpses with no items on them will only remain for 3 hours (in game or out). This is to discourage people from "spamming" their corpses in an area. So make sure to get rezzes quickly when needed, or remember to put something on yourself if facing the possibility of dying on a CR. Another interesting bit of news is that the test server now includes an Alarm with the interface. Seems like this will aid in timing buffs, camps, rezzes, or real life obligations. Lastly I'd like to note that this site is still being shifted around a bit as I am continuing to edit the coding for efficiency and cross-browser compatibility.

Complete Heal Downgrade
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
Obviously there will be many changes with the upcoming release of Planes of Power, though some of the announcements regarding old abilities are a bit surprising and upsetting even. A new <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=52118" target="new">article</a> has been posted on the official EQ website, stating that the 10k max of complete heal is being downgraded to 7.5k. This may not seem so significant at lower levels, but will most likely create an impact on the cleric raiding community and their abilities as HP totals continue to rise.
