Go to Lake Rathetear and find Shmendrik Lavawalker at +3600, 0. If you are coming from the South Karana zone, follow the wall to the left. He stands on the hill near a cabin.<br><br>
 
You say, "Hail, Shmendrik Lavawalker"<br>
Shmendrik Lavawalker says, "Hail, good Kyrah!! Be wary near the waters of Lake Rathe! The Riptide goblin king, Lord Bergurgle has been commanding his minions to murder and rob all who come near it! I am here seeking his death but I am afraid I am no match for all of his subjects. I shall reward you greatly for the death of Lord Bergurgle. I simply ask that you bring me his crown as proof."<br><br>

Lord Bergurgle spawns in an underwater cavern, so you'll need some form of enduring breath. Head to the island with 3 aviak guards (straight across from SK zone). Swim down to the underwater entrance located at +2830, -910, -220. Make your way through the tunnel until you reach an open area with a small tower. Swim up to the second floor and you'll see 3 goblins plus a dark elf named Deep. Don't worry about Deep, she will be indifferent and is not a part of the cleric epic. However, you will need to be careful not to attack her, since she packs quite a punch! The place holder and Lord Bergurgle spawn directly above Deep on a 28 minute timer. The regular goblins are around level 40, and the Lord cons blue to a level 60 player. Low 50s should bring a few friends to help out, mid-50s can solo if careful but would be best with a partner, and a level 60 could easily take care of the camp. Once Lord Bergurgle spawns, take him down quickly before he gets to CH himself. Loot "Lord Bergurgle's Crown" from the corpse and head back to Shmendrik.<br><br>

Hand Shmendrik the crown and you'll see the following message:<br>
Shmendrik Lavawalker shoves the crown into a scorch marked leather satchel and cackles uncontrollably as madness twists his features and flames dance in his eyes. You, Yumanea, have reduced the Riptides into chaos! Without a king to keep them in control they will ravage the settlements surrounding this lake! After the slaughter I shall return and easily burn the remainder of the villages and fishing shanties to the ground! None shall escape the fires of the Tyrant!!<br>
You gain party experience!!<br><br>

Natasha Whitewater shouts, "The Triumvirate of Water has decreed your fate, Shmendrik Lavawalker!! I am here to deliver said fate!!"<br><br>

Shmendrik Lavawalker says, "I'll slay you like I slaughtered your fellow missionaries! The Triumvirate can not decide the fate of a follower of the Tyrant!!"<br><br>

Natasha Whitewater says, "Enough!! Your existence has come to an end!"<br><br>

Shmendrik Lavawalker is overcome with madness and rage.<br><br>

Natasha Whitewater says, "This conflict has been destined by the waters of the Triumvirate!"<br><br>

Natasha will attack Shmendrik. Let her kill him, once dead the Spirit of Flame will spawn. Kill the Spirit. Natasha may or may not join in, but if she does you'll have to nuke fast. Loot a "Damaged Goblin Crown" from the Spirit's corpse and hand it to Natasha.<br><br> 

Natasha Whitewater says, "I will have this crown returned to the Riptide Goblins immediately! Should you ever come across an Erudite name Omat Vastsea give him this sea shell. The waters of Norrath shimmer with awareness of your deeds here today!"<br><br>

She will hand you an "Ornate Sea Shell".<br><br>

Go to Timorous Deep and find the "hidden" island. You will need to locate two underwater tunnels to get there. The first is located at -11530, -3725. The second tunnel is located at -11340, -1300. Omat Vastsea will be next to the inn.<br><br>
 
You say, "Hail, Omat Vastsea"<br>
Omat Vastsea bows deeply, "I have been expecting you, Kyrah. The waters have foretold your arrival. I am High Priest Omat Vastsea of the Triumvirate missionaries. Please feel free to enjoy the quiet solitude of this inn."<br><br>

Give Omat the Ornate Sea Shell from Natasha.<br><br>

Omat Vastsea says, "So, you are a friend of Natasha's? That is good to see. She is a very wise and gifted woman. The Riptide goblins have adopted a new king but are still in a vulnerable state until his subjects accept his rule. The Plasmatic Priesthood is aware of the weakened state of the Riptides and has convinced the Fire Peak goblins to strike against them. Although I do not agree with the mannerisms or actions of any goblin clan, such a war would be detrimental to all who are caught in its path. Lord Gimblox of the Fire Peak clan has been meeting with a member of the Plasmatic Priesthood in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Locate the Plasmatic Priest, hand him this statue to hinder his powers, then eliminate him and bring me his robe."<br><br>

Omat will give you a "Coral Statue of Tarew".<br><br>

Go to the Temple of Solusek Ro with a couple groups of 50+ players. You are looking for a male "seeker" who spawns at 9am and despawns at 9pm game time. He is located +325, +40 on the second floor. Give him the Coral Statue and get ready to run back to your fighters (who normally set up at the zoneline to avoid conflict with other NPCs).<br><br>

You will see the following text:<br> 
A seeker shakes violently as his hand closes on the coral statue and flames dance in the depths of his eyes! The statue begins to emit a reddish glow then shatters in a burst of a fire and smoke! The flames in the plasmatic priest's eyes vanish with the explosion and only madness remains! "The Triumvirate thinks that destroying my spirit of flame will stop me?!! I will kill you all now, the goblins will continue to war, and when my spirit is restored I will ensure that Ixiblat Fer consumes all of Norrath in his flames!!"<br><br>

The seeker will transform into the Plasmatic Priest, who is very aggressive and level 55. His abilities are those of a cleric (pointing out the obvious here!). Kill him with your team and loot the "Blood Soaked Plasmatic Robe".<br><br>

Now you're off to Solusek A to kill another goblin, by the name of Lord Gimblox. He can be found at -800, -370 and is level 30, usually no problem for a 40+ player to solo. His place holders are a Large Fire Goblin or a Fire Goblin Shaman, on a timer of 19 minutes. Loot "Lord Grimblox's Signet Ring".<br><br> 

Go back to Omat Vastsea in Timorous Deep and hand him the "Blood Soaked Plasmatic Robe".<br><br>

Omat Vastsea says, "You have proven yourself to be one who is willing to take responsibility for his own actions. Such a trait is desired by all deities to be present in their faithful. I pray that you had the wisdom to slay Lord Gimblox as well as the Plasmatic Priest in order to prevent further advancement of the incursion against the Riptides. Priestess Natasha awaits inside the inn for Lord Gimblox's ring, make haste for she is a busy woman and will soon depart."<br><br>

He will give you the "Orb of Frozen Water" and Natasha Whitewater will spawn. Give Natasha "Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring" and give you another "Ornate Sea Shell" along with information on obtaining the second orb.<br><br>

Natasha Whitewater says, "Thank you, Kyrah, for your services thus far. The Triumvirate missionaries are, so far, impressed. However, there is yet another threat rising from the Plasmatic Priesthood that may have dire effects on all of Norrath if it is not stopped. An Iksar member of the Triumvirate missionaries has discovered that the Plasmatic Priesthood has somehow convinced the sarnak summoners of Chardok to assist them in summoning Ixiblat Fer to Norrath. Take this shell to Naxot Deepwater in the Burning Woods so that she knows I have sent you. We ask that you return with the Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer as well as evidence to show that the Plasmatic Priesthood is dealing with the sarnaks. High Priest Omat will await your return. I must depart for now. I pray for your success."

On lord Bergle, you can swim up to the top of the tower and perch on the top of the wall, looking down into room. from there pacify the room and pluck out only the center goblin.  That is the one that is PH. that way you are only having to fight the one mob. The self heal would make it very tough to keep all cleared solo. I was two boxing with my chanter and we sat on opposite corners to have full view of room. Cleric opened with nuke then chanter to ping-pong between the two. Even with thier efforts to self heal they died quickly.  The other 2 didn't add. When bergle popped I put chanter on follow and after opening nuke we swam out and down to floor to make sure there were no adds in the longer fight with him, but after all three mana drain spells were cast by chanter he never CH'd self and died almost as quick as the others. I also got the damaged crown first, but for whatever reason the npc made no effort to fight the spirit and had to take it out again by myself so they may have changed it so she wont KS.

I did the first part of this quest and I would like to recommend another way to do it. When you arrive in Lake rathe go straight to kill Shmendrik then the spirit of flame and loot the Damaged goblin crown then you can go to the tower to camp the Lord Bergurgle.  As the pop time for the Lord is around 6 to 7 hours and the one of Shmendrik only 3 hours the second one will be back before you will get the Lord Bergurgle's Crown and you will be able to give him and to finish this part safely. I did once using the normal way and I had the bad surprise to see Shmendrik running in the water at the end of the fight with Natasha and then the Spirit popped and me and my friends was not able to kill him before Natasha then I had to restart the Lord Camp for another 7 hours. By this second way you do not have to care of the fight with Natasha as you have already the Damaged goblin crown to give to her. Nevertheless the second time I rooted Shmendrik before he runs in the water then we was able to kill him before Natasha and a second cleric which joined our group to see how to do could loot the Damaged Goblin Crown for his Epic.

About the lord camp be informed that most of the Deepwater goblins have a own heal, not a CH but a heal for about 30 to 50% of their life and they can cast it very often. My advice about to camp it is to go on the top of the tower looking under you to the second floor and kill all goblins as soon as they pop as fast as you can. As Cleric 56 with Judgement I was not able to keep this spot alone because casting time of Judgement is too long even with Reckonning and Sound of force (I do not have yet Stun command) some of these goblins could be difficult to kill. I was helped by some friends casters and I pulled with my Judgement doing around 50% of damage of these goblins then the second caster (Wiz in my case) finished with his DD.

Be sure when you start this camp to be able to stay the 7 hours necessary to get the Lord because I think that if you leave the camp you will have to restart for a new 7 hours Camp.

That how I did and I hope it will help.

After this second camp I went to SOL A to kill Lord Grimblox but this is really easier than the first Lord.
