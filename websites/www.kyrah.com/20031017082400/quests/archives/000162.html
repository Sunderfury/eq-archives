Go to Greater Faydark and find Seana Marsinger by the spires.<br><br>

You say, "Hail, Seana Marsinger"<br>
Seana Marsinger says, "Hello, my name is Seana Marsinger. I am here representing my loyalty to the League of Antonican Bards. It matters not to me whether you support the League or loathe it propaganda is not my objective. Everyone must find their own truths in this life path, so says Quellious. To business then, are you [familiar with the Plane of Hate?]"<br><br>

You say, "I am familiar with the Plane of Hate"<br>
Seana Marsinger says, "Good, I need someone that has a bit of an eye for how things should look up there. My brother and I have been studying Innoruuk and his intricate dealings for years. Being raised in New Tanaan may lend us certain neutrality towards all people, yet the values our parents have instilled in us do not allow us to let him go unwatched. In fact, I have begun to believe that my paranoia may prove useful not only to the League, but to the Citizens of Tranquility and New Tanaan itself as well. We have received a simple [piece of intelligence] that may conceivably upset the entire balance of the Pantheon and have most dire repercussions here in Norrath."<br><br>

You say, "what piece of intelligence?"<br>
Seana Marsinger says, "An old friend of our father's in Qeynos, Jusean Evanesque, has been very busy sorting out the information that is coming to him in droves. The first clue came from Kardin Nillic in Gunthak, and then in bits and pieces from many travelers moving through Qeynos. Piracy on the seas has grown, and somehow the Broken Skull Clan has gained power that should have been out of their grasp. Our informants there say that it can only come from Innoruuk. I am afraid that the Plane itself has shifted with this power. I do not believe that we will be able to uncover all that we need [alone] in time to warn people of the dangers."<br><br>

You say, "why are you alone?"<br>
Seana Marsinger says, "Our parents are back in Qeynos assisting Jusean with all that needs to be verified and ensuring that the League's network contacts are all still viable. They will need to stay there in case we must get the word out quickly. I do not believe that any of the residents of Tanaan would approve of our little quest, and would view it as biased. Thus we are here alone. Does this type of project [interest] you?"<br><br>

You say, "yes it interests me"<br>
Seana Marsinger says, "I believe it is safest if you study those who have similar interests as yourself. Travel to the Plane of Hate and observe those that call themselves clerics of hate and spite golems. My interaction with these creatures has been mostly at a distance, and I am not as familiar with them as I would like. If you survive long enough to uncover a minor signet that shows you have indeed studied the priests, and truly wish to aid with this cause, bring it to me along with some vampire dust and a diamond. I can craft you protective item and may have some further work for you to do."<br><br>

You will need to venture into the Plane of Hate with a team of companions and loot the following no drop items:<br><br>

1) Minor Signet of the Dark Priest<br><br>

2) Vampire Dust<br><br>

3) Diamond<br><br>

Hand the three items to Seana Marsinger to receive your reward.

This quest was way too easy to complete. Took a couple of hours in hate killing in North end with a single group.  This Gem replaces the unidentifiable pulp as my ranged item of choice. Nice line of quests for those who are casual players. The Hate revamp was by far long over due. I recommend this quest to any and every cleric.  - Dennli Trueheart: Tribunal
