You must first have the Orb of Frozen Water and Orb of Clear Water to begin part three. You should also have a Shimmering Pearl from Natasha Whitewater. Bring this to Nagafen's Lair (Sol B). You are looking for a human-form Zordak Ragefire who spawns right outside the Fire Giant castle (-1380, -350) on a ledge, under a greenish yellow banner with a 24 hour respawn time. You may or may not want to bring company with you, depending on your strategy. If you're going solo though, having DA and DB memmed is a good idea. Give Zorak the pearl and you'll receive a "Swirling Pearl" and "Zordak's Box of Binding" (container, have a general inventory slot open) along with the following text:<br><br>

Zordak Ragefire stares at Kyrah with unblinking eyes. A wide grin crosses Zordak's face and flames flicker in the depths of his eyes. "Welcome to the new fortress of the Plasmatic Priesthood! It's a shame about Lord Nagafen's untimely death, really it is! Such a powerful and noble creature should not perish at the hands of mortals."<br><br>

Now head over to Skyfire Mountains and speak with Warder Cecilia (+3000, -3200). NOTE: If you did the previous turn-in before the quest changes, Cecilia will give you the box needed.<br><br>

Kyrah says, "Hail, Warder Cecilia"<br>
Warder Cecilia says, "Greetings, you have made excellent time. We received word that Zordak was gathering his power here, and we still have little knowledge of his true intentions. Scattered throughout these mountains there are small Pearlescent Shards, binding four of these shards together within a Box of Binding should allow me to create a Seal. This seal, when fused with a Swirling Pearl inside Zordak's heart should allow our seers to divine his true intentions, even after he has been slain. Once you have the seal I will release Zordak, make haste I will not be able to hold him for long."<br><br>

Gather a hunting party and start killing mobs in the zone. Reports indicate that the pearlescent fragments have a 1% chance of dropping from any type or level of mob in Skyfire. You may also want to make your interest known publicly so that soloing players can point you in the right direction should one drop from their mob. Once you have 4 "Pearlescent Fragments" combine them in the Box of Binding. This will result in "An Assembled Pearlescent Shard".<br><br>

Gather a raiding force near the Warder and hand in the assembled pearl. She will return "Pearlescent Seal" and spawn the human Ragefire (lvl 55, aggroes right away). Kill him and the dragon form will spawn (level 60). Loot "Impure Heart of Zordak Ragefire" (container, make sure you have a general inventory slot). Combine the Swirling Pearl and Pearlescent Seal in the box to create "Zorak Ragefire's Heart".<br><br>

Time to pay a final visit to your old friend Omat Vastsea in Timorous Deep's hidden oasis. Hand him the heart to receive the "Orb of Vapor".<br><br>

Omat Vastsea says, "I see now that Zordak Ragefire and the exiled elder dragon Zordakalicus were the same being. That explains how he resisted our attempts to divine his affairs and past. Each of these orbs I have granted you represents one of the Triumvirate. Jhassad Oceanson awaits on the shore below to perform the ritual that will merge the orbs into a single Orb of the Triumvirate and summon an avatar from the Plane of Water. Present the Orb of the Triumvirate to the Avatar of Water when it arrives and allow your destiny to be unraveled."

This was fixed with the 3/13 patch. Ragefire will now only drop one heart as intended!

Just an information:
It seems that lately there are sometimes dropping 2 hearts of Ragefire.
So joining a RF Raid as Cleric might be sometimes rewarded pretty well when you havent done that part yet ; )
