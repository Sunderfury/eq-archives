Find Mallius Darkwater near the water's edge in the Gulf of Gunthak.<br><br>

You say, "Hail, Mallius Darkwater"<br>
Mallius Darkwater lifts his sword out of the water at his feet and scans his eyes across you. "Hello, Kyrah. The waters stir angrily today. Prexus is not pleased at the tarnishing of his waters by the spawn of Innoruuk. The Deepwater Knights have been trying to locate this [place] for many years."<br><br>

You say, "what place?"<br>
Mallius Darkwater says, "The legends of Broken Skull Rock have been whispered for years. Indeed several of our greatest vessels were lost while in search of this island. Many of our [knights] died trying to clease Prexus' waters of this great Evil."<br><br>

You say, "what knights?"<br>
Mallius Darkwater says, "Most recently a Cavalier named Chester Steelblade went in search of the legend. He was gone at sea for months before we recieved word from him. The letter we received spoke of a map that he'd found as well as a somewhat cryptic reference to having found the [key] to Broken Skull Rock. One of our [clerics] took a small group out in search of him, but we have received no news from either group."<br><br>

You say, "what clerics?"<br>
Mallius Darkwater says, "The cleric that went in search of Chester's crew is called Alina Crystalia and she was barely more than a student when she left. We didn't want to let her go, but ultimately we had little say in the matter. She was always very fond of Chester. She may have in fact found him, although I suspect too late to save either of them. Clerics of Prexus are required to carry with them a Deepwater Emblem to identify them, if nothing else I hope to find Alinia's Emblem to return it to Erudin."<br><br>

The "Deepwater Emblem" drops from various MoBs, most commonly the pirates in Harbor of Dulak's ships. Bring it back to Mallius.<br><br>

Millius Darkwater bows his head quietly as his eyes bring recognition to his mind. "Alina at least has met a bitter end. Her spirit surely lingers nearby. Find her and free her from her burden, Kyrah. Her quest goes unfinished." <br><br>

He will hand "Alina's Ring" to you. You are seeking "an Erudite Spirit" in the Gulf of Gunthak (-850, -670). You may need to kill several placeholders, which spawn on a 20 minute cycle. Give the ring to the spirit.<br><br>

"an erudite spirit is surrounded by a warm glow as the ring touches her ethereal form. Her lips curl into a smile as she begins to fade away into the mist. You hear something fall to the ground. You notice a wet scroll half burried in the sand. You reach down and pick it up."

If you go to Dulak, many people will /ooc the Deep Water Emblem for someone to pick up.  The hardest part of the quest I found was getting the Erudite Spirit(Female) to spawn.  It didn't take me long to get her to spawn, but when I was helping a friend we waited 4-5hrs before she spawned again.  The thing I can suggest is kill every undead mob there, even the one in the half sunken ship on the shore line.  The more undead you kill the better chance you have to getting her to spawn.  It's an easy quest to do but can be very tedious.  Good luck on it and take care

I looted the scroll in Gunthak. Swim to the south from him to the beach. Follow the right wall to the tunnel. Have someone with you to cast invis or have invis potions. Some of the mobs see invis, so be careful. Follow the tunnel, until the fork. Take the first fork to the raider village. There seem to be more of the dark old world races at this village, but when we were there, it was heavily camped. We killed mobs at the entrance for about 30 minutes. XP was slow. One deepwater emblem dropped during that time.
