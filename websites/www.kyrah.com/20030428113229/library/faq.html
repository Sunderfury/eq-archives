<a name="stats"><b>Which stat should I focus on most when starting out?</b></a><br>
Opinions vary quite a bit in this area. Obviously, you'll want a decent amount of wisdom so that you'll have mana to heal. There are other factors to consider as well however. Since clerics can gain aggro from their healing spells AC, HP, and STA are important. A cleric shouldn't have to waste many heals on themself. You may want some STR items too, since clerics typically have very low STR yet have to carry around heavy equipment. This will also help if you choose to work on your melee skills a bit. And lastly, there are a lot of pure mana items available which may be more of a gain than wisdom, especially once over 200 wis.<p>

<a name="money"><b>How do I make money as a newbie to buy spells and equipment?</b></a><br>
It's usually rough the first time around if you just started playing Everquest. Some players collect stacks of batwings and bone chips to sell to other classes who use them for spell components. You may also want to consider taking up a trade skill, especially if you find yourself encountering the ingredients along the way. Some simple recipes such as Fishrolls (Baking skill) and Leather Padding (Tailoring skill) are very useful to other players. For armor, you should try talking to NPCs for simple quests. The best place to start is in your home guild hall.<p>

<a name="weapon"><b>What kind of weapon should a cleric use?</b></a><br>
Not all clerics carry a weapon since meleeing is not the main purpose of a cleric, but at lower levels you will probably find yourself tanking a bit. Clerics are limited to the 1hb and 2hb skills. Weapons using these skills are normally maces, hammers, clubs, and staves. A 2hb weapon will typically hit harder but slower, and the benefit of a 1hb weapon is hitting faster and being able to carry an item in your secondary slot.<p>

<a name="train"><b>Which skills do I have to train in to use?</b></a><br>
Meditate at lvl 8, Dodge at lvl 15, Specialization at lvl 30.<p>

<a name="specialize"><b>What is specialization? And what should I specialize in?</b></a><br>
At level 30 clerics gain the ability to train points into specialization. With specialization, you may reduce the possiblity of fizzling and use less mana. A caster can specialize in all magical areas up to 50. They may max out only one to 200. For a cleric, alteration is normally the hands down choice since it allows for more efficient healing.<p>

<a name="oops"><b>What if I screwed up and want to change my specialization?</b></a><br>
You may change your specialization once through a quest in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Look for Ostorm, he will ask for a ruby and 50 gp.<p>

<a name="timer"><b>How much time do I have to rez a person after their death?</b></a><br>
Currently the limit is 3 hours while in game. The person may log out and come back later for their rez, as long as they do not remain logged in for more than 3 hours. You can consider corpses to see how much time is left to perform a rez on the player.<p>

<a name="celestial"><b>What are Celestial heals?</b></a><br>
Clerics receive a line of heals, each beginning with the word "celestial". These are Heals Over Time, basicly the opposite of a DoT. So why use them over regular instant heals? Well 1) They require less mana to cast and 2) they produce much less aggro. These are great for healing if the target is not nearing immediate death. They also a nice cushion before casting a larger heal with a long casting time.<p>

<a name="chain"><b>What is a CH (Complete Heal) Chain?</b></a><br>
This is a special healing tactic used on raids to keep the Main Tank (MT) alive while battling a difficult mob. A handful of clerics will form an order to cast CH consecutively.<p>

<a name="assist"><b>What does assist healing mean?</b></a><br>
Assist healing is used a lot while raiding. You target the MoB being fought, and hit your /assist key. This will return the player who currently has aggro, and you'll be able to see if they need a heal. If aggro seems to be bouncing around, you may have to repeat the process many times.<p>

<a name="hotkey"><b>How do I make a hotkey for my heals?</b></a><br>
Each spell is numbered 1-8, from top to bottom (using default interface). So if the spell you wish to cast is in the first slot, you would use the command "/cast 1". To add text, you go down to the next line of your hotkey and type what you'd like to say while casting the spell. You will most likely need to use the target command. Where you'd like to see the name of your target, type "%t". Below is an example:
<blockquote>
&nbsp; /cast 1<br>
&nbsp; /g Casting Complete Heal on %t
</blockquote>
Another command you will eventually need to become familiar with is the pause command. This leaves a period of time between your hotkey command. Here's the formula: /pause 100 = 10 seconds. Example:
<blockquote>
&nbsp; /cast 1<br>
&nbsp; /rs Casting Complete Heal on %t<br>
&nbsp; /pause 30<br>
&nbsp; /rs Next cleric cast now!
</blockquote>

<a name="targets"><b>What are the % commands used for returning target values?</b></a><br>
The listing can be found on the <a href="emotes.html">Emote Page</a>.<p>

<a name="root"><b>Which root spell is best for a cleric?</b></a><br>
That is up to the individual since so many clerics have different opinions and preferences. Each root spell has a unique casting time, mana amount, average length, and resistance. Try experimenting and see which you prefer :)<p>

<a name="aaxp"><b>When can I start training AAXP (alternative advancement experience)?</b></a><br>
At level 51 you may start gaining AAXP. There are 6 levels of advancement: General Archetypes (trainable at lvl 51), Priest Archetypes (trainable at lvl 55), Cleric Archetypes (trainable at lvl 59), Planar Advancement (trainable at lvl 61), Priest Planar Abilities (trainable at 61), and Cleric Planar Abilities (trainable at 63).<p>

<a name="reclvl"><b>What are recommended level items?</b></a><br>
Some items have a recommended level for usage listed on its stats which may mean two things: 1) You won't get the full stats until stated level or 2) You won't be able to equip the item at all until the stated level. There's really no way to tell beforehand other than knowledge passed among players.<p>

<a name="planes"><b>At what level will I gain access to the planes?</b></a><br>
Anyone may access the Plane of Knowledge, but all the others require a minimum level of 46 to enter. Once you have obtained the 46th level, you will be able to zone into the old world planes (Plane of Fear, Hate, Air, Growth) along with the 1st tier planes that belong to the Planes of Power expansion (Plane of Tranquility, Nightmare, Innovation, Disease, Justice). To continue onto higher tier planes you will need to perform special tasks to gain flags.
