Head over to Skyshrine and find Commander Luez (a drake).<br><br>

You say, "Hail Commander Leuz"<br>
Commander Leuz says, "Hello Kyrah, I'm the new commander of the Sky Shrine Militia. This group of Shrine residents and newly aligned outlanders are given various tasks to do for the benefit of the Shrine. Are you here to request a task?"<br><br>

You say, "I am here to request a task"<br>
Commander Leuz says 'We have had recent news from one of our scouts in Western Wastes that there have been Storm Giants wandering the coastal area. We have not heard back from this scout in some time. What we need is a volunteer to go deliver some tools so the scout can accurately communicate what is happening back to us."<br><br>

You say, "I will volunteer"<br>
Commander Leuz says, "Very good! Take this to the scout and wait for them to return the report"<br><br>

He hands you Scout Tools which you must bring to Scout Charisa, a human female who spawns just south of Siren's Grotto. Give her the tools and she will respond:<br><br>

Scout Charisa says, "Great! I was wondering when they would send someone out to give me these. In my haste and excitement of this new assignment I forgot these. This scout business is great I must say. It sure beats setting in Southern Ro studying the ruins. I've been following these Storm Giants for days. They've been wandering up and down the coast looking for something."<br><br>

You gain faction with Claws of Veeshan and Yelinak, you lose faction with the Kromzek.<br><br>

This triggers 8 giants who spawn near the shoreline to the south. Seven Kromzek Warriors and one Kromzek Captain. Harmony the seven warriors so that the Captain can be single pulled. Kill him with a group or two and loot the Broken Disk.<br><br>

Give the disk to Scout Charisa, and in return she will give you a Scout's Note for Commander Leuz and a Robe of Benevolence. Give her the robe back, and you will receive a Bracer of Benevolence. Give the bracer back, and you will receive a Talisman of Benevolence.
