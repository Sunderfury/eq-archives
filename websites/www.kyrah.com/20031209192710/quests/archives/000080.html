Find Garadain Glacierbane in Eastern Wastes. Each of these quests will increase faction with the Coldain, and decrease faction with the Kromrif and Kromzek.<br><br>

1) Copper Coldain Insignia Ring<br>
Garadain Glacierbane of Thurgadin asks you to make him a blanket to keep warm. You'll need two high quality tundra kodiak pelts and two high quality snow cougar pelts. Combine them in a sewing kit (tailoring  trivial of 82) and give the result to Garadain for the 1st Coldain Insignia ring.<br><br>

2) Silver Coldain Insignia Ring<br>
Garadain Glacierbane requests that you bring an axe to his nephew, Boridain. Find Boridain and hand him the axe. He will start to wander looking for a rabid kodiak. Follow him around and keep him from dying along the way. Once you see the rabid kodiak, kill it and loot the rabid pelt. Hand this to Boridain immediately (before he despawns) and he will give you a broken axe. This is your proof that you completed Garadain's requested task. Hand the broken axe and the copper ring from the first quest to Garadain to receive the 2nd ring.<br><br>

3) Gold Coldain Insignia Ring<br>
Garadain Glacierbane wants you to make a knife for him. You'll need a high quality walrus hide (from walruses), a wooly rhino horn (from rhinos), and a skinning rock (ground spawn). Combine these items together in a forge (smithing trivial of 65). Give the knife to Garadain along with the silver ring and you'll be rewarded with the 3rd ring.<br><br>

4) Platinum Coldain Insignia Ring<br>
Garadain Glacierbane would like to smith the knife from the last quest, and needs a hammer. He gives you a note for Tain Hammerfrost, who spawns near the dragon bridge. Handing him the note isn't really necessary, if you speak with him you'll see that he's a bit busy running from some giants. Four giants will spawn and try to kill him, try to keep him safe and loot the vial from the named giant. Give the vial to Tain right away and you'll receive a Coldain Smithing Hammer. Bring this along with the gold ring to Garadain for the 4th ring.<br><br>

5) Obsidian Coldain Insignia Ring<br>
Garadain Glacierbane needs your help to intercept a ry'gorr messanger who carries invasion plans. Find the messanger and loot the invasion plans. Hand them to the coldain lookout near Garadain. Several ry'gorr orcs will now spawn, your main focus is the leader who is named Scarbrow and make sure the dwarves at the camp survive. Loot the head from Scarbrow's corpse and give it to Garadain with the platinum ring. You'll now receive the 5th ring.<br><br>

6) Mithril Coldain Insignia Ring<br>
Garadain Glacierbane is wondering what happened to a Coldain force that never returned from an attack on the giants. He wants proof of their demise along with proof of the demise of their killers. You'll need to find an undead coldain named Korrigan and speak to him. He'll explain that it was actually the ry'gorr who killed them, by charming the coldain's own wolves against them. A named wolf at the camp, Icefang, will spawn (or will respawn as a higher version if he was already there). He may aggro on you so try to keep clear. You want to follow him as he runs to an orc camp near the dragon bridge and make sure nothing kills him along the way. At the orc camp, Poxbreath Yellowfang will spawn with 4 oracles. Kill them and loot the note from Poxbreath. Now head to the orc fort near the entrance to Crystal Caverns. A ry'gorr emissary will eventually spawn, don't kill him though. After a few minutes Rodrick will spawn next to him. You will need to kill Rodrick and loot his head. Go back to Garadain and hand in the note, head, and obsidian ring to receive the 6th ring.<br><br>

7) Adamantium Coldain Insignia Ring<br>
Garadain Glacierbane needs you to rescue Corbin Blackwell who is guarded by a giant named Warden Bruke. Kill the Warden for a shackle key, then give the key and your mithril ring to Corbin. He will hand back the ring and make his escape but you're not done protecting him. You must make sure he gets to Dobbin Crossaxe. You'll encounter 4 ry'gorr orcs and 4 giants (one of which is named). Kill them to keep Corbin safe. Once you reach Dobbin, he offers to give you a note as proof if you show him your ring, so hand in the ring. He'll then hand you the note which goes back to Garadain in return for the 7th ring.<br><br>

8) Velium Coldain Insignia Ring<br>
Garadain Glacierbane is preparing for battle against the ry'gorr in the nearby fort. You must give him your adamantium ring to begin, and if you do not complete the quest it will be lost. You will need a decent force on your side, since the battle involves at least 30 orcs. You'll need to keep an eye on Garadain's safety, and kill Chief Ry'Gorr for his head. Give the chief's head to Garadain for the 8th ring.

I've heard of several people MQing the rings so it should be possible. If you perform the last turn-in, you should receive the ring. Personally, I never trust MQs 100% but if your friend is deleting, it's worth a shot!

I have a question.  My friend has the 6th ring and is deleting that character.  She offered to MQ the 7th ring for me but we were wondering if it was possible.  If I can get the no drop shackle key it appears that it can be.  My friend hands her 6th ring in to Corbin Blackwell and then I give Corbin the shackle key.  Would Corbin then hand the 6th ring back to my friend who had it in the first place or to me who completed that part of the quest by handing in the key after she handed him the ring?  Basically is the 7th ring multi-questable or not?  Thank you
