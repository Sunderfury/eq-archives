Revamped Quest Section
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
Been doing a lot of work with the quest section. Changed the look and added comment forms in case some information was missed. Also added in quite a few quests which I plan to continue working on!

Clerics Have Competition
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
Today's patch may change the importance of clerics in grouping situations, because now druids and shaman have a heal comparable to CH. There has been a lot of controversy ever since these spells showed up on test, I guess we'll just have to wait and see what this means to the cleric class. Also added today are the new spell effects, though they do not effect all game spells.

New Forum Online Now

I decided that ezBoard has waaayyy too many advertisements and gave phpBB a try. It's a really nice system from what I can tell and after some manipulation I managed to find an agreeable template for it. Feel free to toss me some feedback :)

News of the Moment
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
The <a href="lucy.fnord.net" target="new">Lucy Database</a>, which tosses out the latest EQ spell info, briefly listed some new spells suggesting a max level increase to 65 with the Planes of Power. This has been confirmed <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/articles.jsp?id=51678" target="new">here</a> on the official EQ site.

In other news, players across servers have been laughing their asses off over a <a href="http://pub126.ezboard.com/fbrellrantsfrm13.showMessage?topicID=917.topic" target="new">thread</a> found on Brell's rant board. It follows the tale of a scammer who would have been better off if he kept his mouth shut :P Also be sure to view Woody's <a href="http://www.gucomics.com/sonofabitch.html" target="new">funny comic</a> illustrating the typical reaction of those who read the scammer thread :)

More Cleric Hammers
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
Two more summoned hammer spells have been added for clerics to increase their soloing ability. Lvl 58 Hammer of Divinity and Lvl 60 Hammer of Souls are both NPC drops in Luclin. So far the scrolls have reportedly dropped of Rhags in Ssraeshzra Temple and Doomshade in The Umbral Plains.

Epic Quest Changes
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
The last patch introduced a new system for getting Ragefire to spawn. You still need to head over to Skyfire Mountains, but instead of sitting and waiting at the dragon statue, you'll be doing a bit of work. First find Warder Cecilia, hailing her will give you the "Box of Binding". Now start killing everything you can until you have obtained 4 pearlescent fragments. Combine these fragments in the box and hand it to Warder Cecilia. You will receive a Seal, and the human form of Ragefire will spawn. Complete according to the original instructions (found in the quest section of this website).
