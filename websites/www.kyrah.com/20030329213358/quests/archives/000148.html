Find Taxonomist Darwin Grisk in West Freeport.<br><br>

You say, "Hail, Taxonomist Darwin Grisk"<br>
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says, "Have you come to [help]? If not, be gone! I will not have my time wasted."<br><br> 

You say, "I have time to help"<br>
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says, "Recently rumors have surfaced that a new race, the Luggalds, walks the land. I suspect that some evil force is involved in their appearance. Are you [willing] to risk unknown dangers to help me find out?"<br><br>

You say, "I am willing"<br>
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says, "Good. I have not been able to confirm the existence of these beings. I will need definite proof if the rest of the members of the Academy are to believe me. Take this Warded Satchel and retrieve three examples of Luggald Flesh."<br><br>

Go to Dulak's Harbor and kill Luggalds until you have 3 pieces of their flesh. Combine them in the bag given by Grisk and hand it back to him.<br><br>

Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says, "Very good. This will no doubt convince the others. However, we don't have time to wait for their consensus. Deep in the uncovered Crypt of Nadox the Luggalds seem to be at work. This can mean nothing good for the mortal world. You must provide further [aid]."<br><br>

You say, "what aid?"<br>
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says, "Travel to the Crypt of Nadox and slay as many of the Luggalds there as you can. This will slow their plans, but to truly damage their efforts I will need more information. Bring me three more samples of their fecund flesh so that I can compare them with the other examples. Combine them in this Warded Chest."<br><br>

Now head to the Crypt of Nadox and kill Luggalds until you have 3 fecund flesh. Combine them in the box and return it to Grisk.<br><br>

Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says, "Alas, it all becomes clear! The Luggalds seek to spread their vile race. I had received word of a dark elf performing arcane rites on the shores of Toxxulia Forest. Now I know she must be attempting to summon other Luggalds. She is expecting an agent of the enemy. Talk with her. Then deal with her and any evil she creates."<br><br>

Find Assistant T'os on the beach of Toxxulia Forest.<br><br>

You say, "Hail, Assistant T'os"<br>
Assistant T'os says, "Hmm. You aren't familiar. . .no matter. All is ready. Perpare yourself. Who knows what may happen. . ."<br><br>

Assistant T'os will summon a giant skeleton, which is capable of being slain by a group of 50+ players. Loot the cursed heart from the corpse and return to Freeport.<br><br>

You say, "Hail, Taxonomist Darwin Grisk"<br>
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says, "Thank the gods, you have returned safely! We had heard tell of your battle. Did you by chance find anything of informational value?"<br><br>

Give him the cursed heart.<br>
Taxonomist Darwin Grisk says, "Well done. I can only imagine the evil you averted. Here. Take this a token of my personal thanks. May we all continue to benefit from your valor."
