This quest begins in North Qeynos. In Crow's Tavern you will find an Erudite named Umvera Dekash.<br><br>

You say, "Hail Umvera Dekash"<br>
Umvera Dekash says, "What, Kyrah? Do I look like a merchant to you? Just because all these merchants are in my library, it doesn't mean that I am one. If you are interested in something other than spell scrolls, then, we can talk."<br><br>

You say, "I am interested"<br>
Umvera Dekash says, "Ah, so you do have half a wit about you! Very well. As you can clearly see, I am the librarian here. I keep track of all of the mystic tomes that enter this divine building. I also take care of all of the purchasing. Have you something to offer?"<br><br>

You say, "I have something to offer"<br>
Umvera Dekash says, "Excellent! You have no idea how difficult it is to get good help these days. Do you think you would have the time to gather some information for me?"<br><br>

You say, "I will help you gather information"<br>
Umvera Dekash say, "Even better! Well, it has been some time since the Tesch Val gnolls moved in on the Split Paw. That being said, we still know little to nothing of their origins. If you can bring me back the four scrolls that our diviners speak of, I believe I can reward you well."<br><br>

The scrolls you need are considerably easy for a 22+ player to aquire by killing the gnolls which spawn in the Splitpaw dungeon as well as right outside at the spires of South Karana. These gnolls drop two different kinds of tanned split paw skins, you need to keep an eye out for the ones that appear rolled up and are LORE rather than the scrolls that appear as unscribed spells. There are 4 different scrolls that you will need and if you open them, you'll notice a number near the beginning of the text (aside from the number itself, you will be unable to read the text so it should be obvious).<br><br>

Once you have aquired all 4 scrolls go back to Qeynos and hand them to Umvera Dekash in Crow's Tavern. You will then receive a book of the translated split paw skins which he will instruct you to bring to Jheron Felkis to be properly bound. You can find Jheron Felkis in East Freeport. He is in an upstairs room of Velith & Bardo's shop. Give him the book and he will return the bound result, A Paw Book.<br><br>

The book must be brought back to Umvera Dekash in Crow's Tavern. He will give you a sealed letter to bring to Durkis Battlemore, who can be found in the Butcherblock Mountains within a hut near Kaladim. Upon giving the letter to Durkis, you will finally be rewarded for your work with a pair of Gem Inlaid Guantlets.
