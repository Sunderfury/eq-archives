Yet Another Epic Guide
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
The way I see it, you can never have too many epic guides! Why? Because the cleric epic is an extremely useful item, one that continues to be relevant even if the primary slot is upgraded. However the quest happens to be a very frustrating one, requiring a lot of time, assistance, and of course - organization! So I put together my own version of a checklist, with the intention of being printer-friendly (the other walkthrough includes comments). In addition, the item effects page in the library is mostly complete now. I intend to continue updating as more effects are revealed, and as I get information on the ones I missed!

Patch & Site Additions
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
The following is a part of today's patch. Click the "more" link at the end of this update to see the full message.<br><br>
In the depths of the Lavastorm Mountains there is only one ruler. But even his burning breath and power have their limits. Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach. These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden. Some say that he's already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value. Other say that he couldn't have carried it all off by himself. But most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted. Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories? This new adventure zone will only be around for a while, so you may want to visit soon.<br><br>
Another official announcement of interest explains that new items from the Lost Dungeons expansion will be able to modify the effects of other equipment, possibly increasing their value to your character. The article can be found at <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/lostdungeons/new_items.jsp" target="new">this link</a>!<br><br>
Updates for this site include a listing of various item effects. There is still more to add, hopefully by the end of the week. In the equipment section there are three new types of armor, these are Elemental plate pieces that are created through tradeskills.

Note: Some internal data restructuring created a delay in the introduction of the new platinum slot in the shared bank and the new text filters. We will bring those to the Live servers as soon as we can. <br><br>


** New Adventure in Lavastorm! ** <br><br>

In the depths of the Lavastorm Mountains there is only one ruler. But even his burning breath and power have their limits. Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach. These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden. Some say that he's already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value. Other say that he couldn't have carried it all off by himself. But most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted. Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories? <br><br>

This new adventure zone will only be around for a while, so you may want to visit soon. <br><br>


** Spells ** <br><br>

- Summoned Burning Affliction focus items added - Mages have four new spells, Summon Wooden Bracelet, Summon Stone Bracelet, Summon Iron Bracelet, and Summon Steel Bracelet. The bracelets summoned provide the Burning Affliction effect for DoT spells. <br><br>

- Summoned container spells updated - The Quiver of Marr, Bandoleer of Luclin and the Pouch of Quellious now appear filled with the appropriate item (for example, the Quiver of Marr now appears with six stacks of arrows). Also, these items should all be exactly the same, so the quiver function should work properly. <br><br>

- Mass Enchant spells corrected - The mass enchant spells for Adamantite, Brellium, Mithril and Steel now create the 5 enchanted blocks that they should. <br><br>

- Illusion: Guktan is available - This is an illusion spell for the new Froglok models. <br><br>

- Illusion: Scaled Wolf is available - This is an illusion spell for the Scaled Wolf seen in Kunark. <br><br>

- Tiny Companion - The spell scroll for this spell is no longer No Drop. <br><br>

- Dooming Darkness no longer overwrites Cascading Darkness. <br><br>


** Items ** <br><br>

- Moss Covered Hood - This item can now be equipped by all classes. <br><br>

- Silk String - This item is now stackable. <br><br>


** Trade Skills ** <br><br>

- New Fletching recipes added - We've added several new Karana-only fletching recipes to help round out that skill. <br><br>


** Quests and Zones ** <br><br>

- Halls of Betrayal - Corrected an error with some of the quest item drops in this zone. <br><br>

- Plane of Time - The events in Plane of Time B now remember the progress your raid has made through the zone when you leave and will restore you to the same state when you return. <br><br>

- Kagazz will respond when you ask him about fasteners. <br><br>

- Experience in city zones updated - Some time around the release of Planes of Power we reduced the experience gain in some city zones. Tthe experience gained from quests in those zone has been increased. <br><br>

- Ogre newbie quests - Added a weapon quest for young ogres. <br><br>

- Iksar Necromancer Spell Vendors - The Iksar necromancer spell vendors have moved and are a lot closer to the necromancer guild. This should make it easier for new necromancers to find these vendors and will hopefully boost their sales. <br><br>



** Miscellaneous ** <br><br>

- Spell book bug - Corrected a bug that was causing characters to be randomly forced to stand up when in their spell book. <br><br>

- Client crash information - If your game crashes on the client side, a dialogue box will come up asking if you'd like to send us the information about the crash. This information may help us pinpoint problems and make it easier to fix them. Only information relevant to the crash, your character name, server name and the zone you were in will be sent. <br><br>


** Fan Faire ** <br><br>

Chicago Fan Faire is sneaking up on us! The Chicago event will be held September 26-28th, and the last day to guarantee your spot at the event by pre-registering is September 8th. To reserve your spot and pre-register, or to simply get more information, please go to www.everquest.com/fanfaire. See you in Chicago!

Quest Listing Enhancement
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
Finally got around to organizing the quest section. You may now choose to sort by level, which isn't an exact science, but it gives a general idea. You can also sort quests by the expansion era to which it pertains. Lastly, a link is now included to new quests. This will display the 10 most recent entries added to the database.
