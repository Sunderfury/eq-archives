Find Yeolarn Bronzeleaf in the Felwithe cleric guild.<br><br>

You say, "Hail, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf."<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says, "Hail, Kyrah! We of Tunare are charged with protecting the Great Mother from the forces of Innoruuk. Even now, the evil minions of this foul deity are despoiling our great forest. Will you help us [protect the Mother]?"<br><br>

You say, "I will protect the Mother."<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says, "Just outside the gates of Felwithe, the forces of Innoruuk gather in the guise of decaying skeletons. Bring me four sets of bone chips as proof of your vigilance. I assure you, your faith shall not go unrewarded."<br><br>

Hand him the 4 bone chips, unstacked.<br><br>

Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says, "Praise Tunare! I knew you would be victorious. I reward you with this spell, and pray that it will help you in your fight against the unholy forces of Innoruk. When you are ready you will make a fine [Initiate of Tunare]."<br><br>

Faction standing with Clerics of Tunare, King Tearis Thex, and Anti-Mage increases.<br><br>

You say, "What Initiate of Tunare?"<br>
Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says, "The Teir'Dal behind the undead plague in our forest have discovered a means of creating a terrible undead called a Ghast. These Ghasts have been sighted in the Lesser Faydark and must be destroyed. Bring me four of the vile creatures hearts."<br><br>

It is said that these Ghasts are rare night spawns, and best sought with a tracker. Another help is to use the "Sense Undead" spell.<br><br>

Once you have aquired the four Putrescent Hearts, hand them to Yeolarn.<br><br>

Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says, "Praise Tunare!! You have done well young Initiate. Here the symbol of your station within our faith. Return to me when you are ready to [slay the necromancer] that has been creating the undead."<br><br>

Faction standing with Clerics of Tunare, King Tearis Thex, and Anti-Mage increases. You receive the first talisman and experience.

A little more information about the reward.  The necklace must be worn and its effect is clickable.  It casts an extremely brief self-only haste buff.  It lasts literally less time than Yaulp.  No mana is used.  Not very valuable unless you are completing the two quests to which this a prerequisite.

I just completed this quest.  I'm level 37, so the MoBs weren't much of a challenge.  Here's exactly what I did.  Every game night starting at 9 p.m. I entered the zone and began casting Sense Undead.  I would then immediately run to the closest undead and kill it.  The highest level creature encountered was about level 12. 

I figured tracking would work better than sense, but it didn't.  I had a Druid with me one night and she could only track about 40% of the zone.  Using sense, I could pick up creatures on the opposite end of the zone.

I killed every undead hoping they were place holders for the rancorous ghasts, butt I don't think it worked.  On nights I found the ghasts, I'd find several very easily.  Other nights, I'd get zero hits.  Never in between, so I suspect that these creatures spawn all at once, possibly every other night or so.

I killed 12 or 14 to gather four hearts.  I spent about 6 hours in the zone.  You could get lucky and get them all quickly, but I could see it taking several hours longer than I spent as well.

There is an undead obelisk just southeast of the center of the zone.  I killed everything here many times and never saw a ghast. I still killed them because they would trigger my Sense Undead spell.  Eliminating them helps you search the zone.

I shouted for help too.  One person killed a ghast and sent me a location for the heart.  It's easy to get across the zone in time.  I offered 20 platinum for the loot.

Dangers: Brownie Scouts don't sell cookies in this zone!  They are yellow and red at 37.  They wander the Eastern half of the zone.  I trained them to Steamfont.  They run fast, so you'll need SoW to out run them.

A Pained Unicorn is amiable to worshipers of Tunare but KoS to many others and Red at level 42.
