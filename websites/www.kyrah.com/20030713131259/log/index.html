 &nbsp;--&nbsp; Today's Patch Message
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
	Ooh! Lots of interesting changes in this patch! To start with, the updated version of the Plane of Hate is now live on all servers! Verant claims they kept the old zone charm while improving the geometry and some encounters such as Innoruuk (no longer a joke to fight against, they say!). Veeshan's Peak has also seen some changes, making it possible to enjoy with small raid forces. The gate restriction has been removed from the zone as well (previously, one could not gate out). A new and highly anticipated dungeon zone, Veksar, is now open on Stormhammer. The entrance to this ancient Iksar city can be found in the Lake of Ill Omen (and I do mean, in the lake!). Hopefully it will hit all servers very soon.<br><br>

<font color="#8876A2">Some cleric highlights from official patch report:</font color="#8876A2"><br><br>

Divine Intervention Fix - Players have been reporting that Divine Intervention was not updating the hit points for the character every time when cast, causing characters to die even though the spell seemed to have saved them. We have been unable to reproduce the issue specifically, but we have made some changes that should fix the problem. Please use /bug with details of the incident if you continue to see this problem.<br><br>

Healing Messages now include the name of the healer - In order to make it clearer who has healed you, we have changed the message that you receive when healed. It will now include the name of the character casting the healing spell: "Bob has healed you for 300 points of damage”.<br><br>

Mark of Kings upgrade - In order to make this spell more appealing then its lower level counterpart, Mark of Karn, we have: increased the duration from 3.5 to 4 minutes, reduced the casting time from 3 to 2 seconds, reduced the mana cost from 170 to 75 and made the spell slightly less resistible.<br><br>

Mana from Buffs - We have increased the maximum amount of mana that can be gained through the use of buff spells.<br><br>

 &nbsp;--&nbsp; Your Own EQ Army
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
	Some may have noticed that the official Everquest website has been "teasing" us over the past 24 hours. Today an announcement has been made for yet another addition to the EQ library of games. Sony plans to release <a href="http://lordsofeverquest.station.sony.com" target="new">Lords of Everquest</a> later this year. LoE is a strategy game that appears to be quite similiar to Warcraft -- using armies to build and conquer. The game will allow solo play as well as online interaction. As usual, this site will not stray from the course of EQ1, but thought this info was worth mentioning!

<div align="justify">
	According to today's patch message, it will now be easier to complete the alternative quests for entering flagged areas in PoP. Also, flags will be awarded to all members of the group upon turn in. The updated Plane of Hate has gone live on the Legends server, it is assumed that this will also be available on the other servers soon. Lots of minor changes and fixes, full message below.

	As you can see the site has a new format for better organization and navigation. The spell listing has been updated and corrected, the flowing thought listings are now current, and a few of the other older sections have been changed around.

 &nbsp;--&nbsp; PoP Armor Quests
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>

	A couple more quests added to the menu regarding the Planes of Power ornate molds. By the way, couldn't find the stats for the Elemental BP anywhere, so I'd appreciate an email if anyone happens to know!

 &nbsp;--&nbsp; Pile of Updates!
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
	Today's patch implimented the ability for any caster with the research skill to also be able to research priest spells (ones that would normally be MoB dropped only), as also explained at <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=54405" target="new">this link</a> from the developer corner on EQ's official website. I have added a chart to the library section with recipes for these combines. Also added to the library is a listing of cleric VT loot (maybe this should be under equip? but I didn't feel like rearranging!). A few more quests have been added, including the second cleric spell quest for Pure Blood. Lastly, a few more levels are now included in the updated spell database. If you'd like to see the full patch message for today, skip down to the more link below updated pages :)

 &nbsp;--&nbsp; Spell Section Updates
</div>

<img src="blank.gif" alt="" height="5" width="5"><br>
<div align="justify">
	Continuing to work on the new spell listing, added a new section to the library on spell components, and improving the forum (which now has a new layout since I lost the first). Information on LoY seems to be trickling in pretty slowly, charms especially are still quite an enigma to most.
