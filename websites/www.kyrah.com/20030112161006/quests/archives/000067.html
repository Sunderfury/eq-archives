Look for Priestess Tarafol in the mutant caves of Echo Caverns.<br><br>

You say, "Hail, Priestess Tarafol"<br>
Priestess Tarafol says, "Oh, these poor forsaken souls. We must do whatever we can to help them. So far I've been unable to find anything that can cure their afflictions. I'm not even certain there is a cure. The least I've been able to do is ease some of their suffering."<br><br>

You say, "what cure?"<br>
Priestess Tarafol says, "I'm not certain what causes the disease that inflicts most of these people. I believe it's from living down in these caverns for so long. It seems most people have a natural immunity, but the few who are stricken are cursed to slowly rot to death. A most horrible and painful way to die. I wish I could do more than just ease their pain."<br><br>

You say, "I want to help you"<br>
Priestess Tarafol says, "You would be willing to do that? That would be great! I've heard of the possible curative powers of many things here on Luclin. I've been so busy here that I haven't been able to go out and search for any of the needed compounds. If you would be so kind as to collect some things for me I would be very appreciative."<br><br>

You say, "collect what things?"<br>
Priestess Tarafol says, "Ok, I need you to find these things... Underbulk Bile, Razorfungus Spores, and Saprophyte Spores. You should be able to be find them within the nearby cavern systems. Please return to me once you have acquired all the ingredients. Thank you very much for assisting. Good luck."<br><br>

1) Underbulk Bile drops from Underbulks<br><br>

2) Razorfungus Spores drops from Fungal Fiends <br><br>

3) Saprophyte Spores drop from The Great Saprophyte<br><br>

All of these mobs are around level 35. Make sure you don't consume the Underbulk Bile or Razorfungus Spores! Once you have everything, bring the items back to Tarafol.<br><br>

Priestess Tarafol says, "Thank you so much!! These will help so much in trying to find a cure for these people. Here take this as a token of my gratitude."<br><br>

The token she gives you is Tarafol's Pendant.
