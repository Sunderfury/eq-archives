Find the Fish Ale pub in South Qeynos. You will need to talk to Micc Koter, who will request some brandy to get more information. He'll tell you that someone named Caninel went looking for the Paw of Opolla in the Plains of Karana.<br><br>

Go to West Karana and look for Caninel along the mountains near North Karana. He will be with two named gnolls. He'll ask for 3 gems, a Moonstone, a Bloodstone, and a Star Rose Quartz. Upon handing them to him, he will tell you the story of when humans in Everfrost first met the Blackburrow Gnolls. Shaman Opolla greeted the humans warmly, but the sentiment was not returned when Gynok Molter cut off her hand. Opolla cursed his family as revenge. The last descendant, Vin Molter, can be found in Qeynos. He will give you more information if you ask about the Paw and the rings on the Paw.<br><br>

When you speak with Vin, he will demand 3 bottles of Khalish and a rat meat pie in exchange for the Paw, but claims to know nothing of the rings. He says that perhaps his father sold them during his travels in Odus.<br><br>

To make the pie, you will need to combine 1 giant rat ear -OR- 2 regular rat ears, flour, and baking spirits in a mixing bowl (baking trivial 28). The unfinished result must be baked in an oven or spit to make the pie (baking trivial 142).<br><br>

Once you hand in the rat ear pie and 3 bottles of Khalish, Vin will give you a Paw container. You can also opt to kill Vin for the container, but will take a negative faction hit with the Qeynos Guards. Now it's time to search for those 4 rings...<br><br>

1) Copper Ring -- This is part of a subquest. Melixis, a cat on Kerra Island at +525, +180, will give you the copper ring if you hand her Bracket Mildew. This is dropped by the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk (+610, +250). It is a rare item and no drop. The Mutant also drops Degenerated Guk Weed, which is needed for the gold ring.<br><br>

2) Gold Ring -- Once again you'll need to talk to Melixis, who will give you the gold ring if you hand her Degenerated Guk Weed which is dropped by the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk.<br><br>

3) Silver Ring -- There are two ways to get this ring. The easy way, is to swim down to the bottom of the pit in Blackburrow and look for a bag around +40, -60. The hard way is to camp the Fungus Mutant in Upper Guk until you see Faerix Spores drop. Give these to Melixis on Kerra Island for the Silver Ring.<br><br>

4) Platinum Ring -- This ring drops from a mummy named Gynok Moltor in Befallen. He spawns near the zone in, and has several placeholders.<br><br>

Now open the Paw container, place the 4 rings inside, and hit combine. You should now have the Paw of Opolla.
