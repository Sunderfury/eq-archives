              soloing guide for Rangers</b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well 
              get used to traveling first off, and second you have to be able 
              to memorize the environment. The main thing that helps me is I can 
              learn a place and set it vaguely to memory the first time I go, 
              and the second time I go I pretty much have it set in my memory. 
              The first key is to know twist turn and spawn place in your surondings. 
              That being said here is where I went and when. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">14-17, 
              22-24: paw - I cannot remember exactly what lvls stuff was in here. 
              I belive that at first the guards would give me exp and are fairly 
              easy to get one at a time. There is also a shaman that spawns by 
              himself that should give exp. There is a gap because at 22 you can 
              pull the bosses and solo them rather than the trash types. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">17-19: 
              Lavastorm - Rock derv's are good exp, as are the lava crawlers, 
              and drakes. Be sure to fight at the zone line though, keep your 
              fire res spell up and save some mana to snare a wandering fire ele 
              if they happen to float by so you can run. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">19-31: 
              Upper Guk - Probably one of the most versitile places out there. 
              It is hard at 19, but you should be able to pull a few Tuk's solo 
              and get good exp. Then move up to gaz, and once the gaz warriors 
              stop attacking you can go on to the special npc locations and get 
              exp that way. This place you REALLY have to know well though to 
              know where the solo spawns are. If you have to fight 2 at a time, 
              snare one and run the other back to the entrance. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">25-31: 
              Cazic Thule - Trains are real nasty but with your cammo on you should 
              be able to pull defenders, warders, and sent's from the maze fairly 
              easy. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">30-31: 
              Runnyeye - The warlord room is a nice place to solo and get exp 
              and decent loot. You have to learn how to break up the spawn though. 
              Pull two out by snareing one and fight the WL and zone. then come 
              back and finish the trash. This might be done at 29 but I think 
              my damage shield tiped the scales. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">25-31: 
              Najena - plenty of stuff in here to solo. TT's, Ogre's, and my favorite 
              is BoneCracker. Just remember to keep them snared. You won't be 
              able to do BC till lvl 30 or so, that is when you can pull him without 
              his friends. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">22-25: 
              Nektulos forest - I like pulling the Dark elf guards and guardians 
              to the zone to lavastorm and fighting them. Not real great exp but 
              there is that revenge factor from all those deaths from Dvinn and 
              Dorn. This is all I can think of right now. There is prolly more 
              but I am sleepy and it is a monday. The limits are at 31 cuase that 
              is where i am and i don't know if it will be easier or harder at 
              32. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This 
              is mainly what I did, it might not work for everyone. Dag(soloist 
              at heart as well) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Oh 
              and to give you an idea, I made one bub exp in four hours at najena 
              the other day. I think mathin said it takes him 3 hours per bub 
              in a good group. Not too bad I don't think. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
              got 16 to 22 in East Karanas starting with carrion spiders,chasm 
              crawlers then moving to gorge hounds,dark stalkers,gnoll reavers, 
              and finally undead reavers to get 22.This was soloing. I suggest 
              getting a partner about 16 or 17 and doing gorge hounds the loot 
              isnt the best but it is good xp.Hunt by the gorge entrance to beholder 
              by the cottages and draw the solo targets close to a wall so not 
              to attract other nasties in mid fight.</font></p>
