              and well met my fellow Ranger! 'Tis an exciting time in the land 
              of Norrath as we unfold the destiny that Tunare has placed before

              choose to share with our kin the adventures, quests and experience

              We're finally moving! :) As I stated a couple of weeks ago, we are 
              moving to a new site. This site is none other than the Soerbaird 
              network. You may have heard of the infamous bards throughout Norrath, 
              and one of its affiliates, the Shamans Crucible. All of these sites 
              are very high caliber and I'm sure you will all be pleased with 
              the new look and feel of The Glade, not to mention being able to 
              print much better *grin*</font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">So, 
              I invite you to take a look at our new home while I am in the process 
              of moving things over. You can find us at <a href="http://soerbaird.com/ranger">http://soerbaird.com/ranger</a></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">As 
              of now, the skills section is finally done, and as many of you requested, 
              it shows what level we get our skills and what they max at. The 
              spells section is up and revised, but has some tweaking remained 
              to be done. One great feature though is the message boards, they 
              are much more streamlined and easier to use than our current boards. 
              Another thing I am developing in the near future is the ability 
              to have, store, and edit Ranger profiles. I have had many requests 
              for this, so stay tuned for this exciting feature coming up!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Thanks 
              again all my Brothers and Sisters as we continue to forge into new 
              and exciting times with The Rangers Glade!</font></p>

              I finally went through 2 weeks of email and posted *lots* of new 
              things today. You'll fine more <a href="/stories">stories</a>, a 
              very nice in character guide to the <a href="/quests">Trueshot Bow 
              quest</a>, more personal Ranger pages in the <a href="/links">links</a> 
              section, a couple of new <a href="/maps">maps</a> and of course 
              more Ranger <a href="/pics">pictures</a> :) I also posted the much 
              anticipated guide to <a href="/misc">Ranger wieldable weapons</a>. 
              This list is geared to mid to upper levels right now, but I am in 
              the process of adding almost 300 items to the Ranger armor and weapon 
              guides, so bear with me.</font></font></p>

              Ok.. back in the swing of things here. Revised the layout of the 
              new Ranger-wearable armor page, added a few more pictures to the 
              <a href="/pics">profiles</a> section, added another <a href="/quests">quest</a> 
              and was sent a rather interesting <a href="/skills">comparison</a> 
              between dual-wielding (2) 1HS weapons as opposed to a 2HS weapon. 
              Maybe now we can end this debate of 1HS vs. 2HS.</font></font></p>

              Yes, it has been slow updating. I am truly sorry, but we are in 
              the process of moving over to the new site. When we do I assure 
              you you will see a *ton* of new stuff. However, to whet your appetite 
              as to the kind of things you will see, check out this amazing guide 
              to <a href="/misc/">Ranger-wearable armor</a> that Cattibree sent 
              me. It is mainly a higher level list, however many of these items 
              are attainable in your mid levels. I really would like people to 
              submit the lower level items, however mundane you think they may 
              be. For example, the Orc Banded vest, or patchwork tunic, so we 
              can give all Rangers a chance to outfit themselves how they see 
              fit. Be warned, however, this guide contains possible spoiler locations 
              to some of the items, but not exact locations. Also, the formatting 
              of it will change tomorrow, so it'll look a little nicer. I can 
              barely contain the excitement of this new site that will be coming. 
              If you thing you like the Glade now, just wait :)</font></font><font size="2" color="#FFFFFF" face="arial">
