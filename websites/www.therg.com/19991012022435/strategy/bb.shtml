            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
              BlackBurrow “Beacon” </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Ok 
              Ranger, you want to go gnoll hunting for a bit eh? Well, you better 
              be at least level 6 if you want to come back out. The first thing 
              about BlackBurrow is the trains. For those who have not heard the 
              term, trains are when more than one gnoll, or any unfriendly, gives 
              chase after a PC. In BlackBurrow, trains are a common site due to 
              the given aspects of this zone. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.The 
              gnolls range from levels 3 up to 16. Some poor sods accidently picks 
              on the wrong gnoll Other gnolls join in and the victim runs for… 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2. 
              ..the nearest zone. There are ONLY 2 zones borders and they are 
              very close to each other. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">3. 
              Last, the zone is very vertically designed and complex. It took 
              me about a dozen visits till I got an idea of where everything is. 
              With gnolls spawning in various spots, and a victim in hysterics 
              because he/she is lost, it doesn’t take much to form a train. So, 
              if you are venturing into this zone at level 6, I’d first recommend 
              taking on the gnolls that lead to BlackBurrow first. One the Qeynos 
              Hills side, take the gnoll that spawns to the right of the cave 
              entrance. If from the Everfrost zone, take on a guard. If you can 
              beat them with relative ease, move on to BlackBurrow. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">6 
              to 10 level strategy: I think the best experience move is to become 
              part of the “Derailment Squad”. Stay near the zone border, mainly 
              the Qeynos Hills border as most trains end here. As the train nears, 
              make sure you don’t see a burly, elite, gaurdsman or commander. 
              If you do, back off! They will make gnoll food of you. Pick one 
              of the gnolls near the end of the train. Feel free to grab one up 
              front if you’re of a higher level and think you can take the heat. 
              If things get bad, run for the border. There are usually others 
              of the squad nearby, so don’t worry too much. If things are quiet, 
              go ahead and pick on the scrawny gnolls that around the top area 
              there. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">11 
              to 14 level strategy: Ok, it should be somewhat safe to roam around 
              a bit. Remember the way out! Learn the caverns bit by bit, and where 
              the nasties spawn. Avoid the elites and commanders as they will 
              use your femurs and tibias to play “Fetch the Stick”. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">15 
              to 18 level strategy: Alright! You’re ready to rock. There are certain 
              area you will want to camp, but be nice and share with others. In 
              the main area, deep in BlackBorrow, there is a ledge that over looks 
              some pools. Single elites spawn there. In a room with two doors, 
              below the ledge, is a stool. Anything from an elite, commander, 
              and shaman appear there. Now in the upper part of the carvens, there 
              are two good spots. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
              Elite Room has 4-5 elites, and 1 commander that appear. Sometimes 
              a shaman or even a high shaman. This is near the spike pit, and 
              closer to what looks like a small bleacher stand. The entry is very 
              narrow and curves right. Be careful when entering as you may have 
              a full house of elite gnolls. Can you say, “Oops, time for a new 
              train.”? In a little further to the caverns from the spike pit, 
              on the left hand side, is a set of 3 alcoves. Two commanders tend 
              to spawn here with an elite and gaurdsman. Good fighting here too. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Even 
              at level 18, when a train of elites and commanders is on me, I’m 
              deadmeat for the most part. All you can do is run for the top and 
              zone. But, here’s what I do to help distance myself from the train 
              when I’m near the Elite Room… </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Sy’s 
              Escape: When suddenly realizing in the Elite Room or the Commanders’ 
              Alcoves, “Oops”, I’ve found an escape that seems to work 100% of 
              the time. From the Elite Room, run along the left wall till you 
              reach the Commanders’ Alcove. Don’t run into the alcove, you’re 
              in enough trouble already! Instead of a left into the alcove, AND 
              instead of going through the door ahead, make a right. You’ll wind 
              up shortly at another door with a gaurdsman near it. Open it and 
              jump off the ledge! Weeee, about a 100ft drop into the water. Swim 
              to the only water level exit, and, congrats, the gnolls do not jump 
              in after you. Still, don’t stop moving as they are up top looking 
              for a way down other than jumping. But, you’re already ½ way home. 
              From the water level exit, cross the short bridge to the door, do 
              NOT go through the door. Make a right and follow the shore line. 
              You’ll soon recognize the way up to the top from there. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Now 
              if I remember right, by the time you make it the zone from the Elite 
              Room, you may have 4 elites, 1 commander, 5 gaurdsmen, 8 regular 
              gnolls, 6 scrawny, and a gnoll pup on your case. This depends on 
              your level – the higher your level, the lesser gnolls leave you 
              alone. Otherwise, 25 gnolls after one prey! This will surprise the 
              Derailement Squad!!! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">That’s 
              about it. Some good experience and some descent loot, but no unique 
              loot that I’m aware of. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Good 
              luck and happy hunting, </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Sy,
