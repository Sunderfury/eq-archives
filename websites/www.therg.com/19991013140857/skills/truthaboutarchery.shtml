            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">First 
              off, let me quantify my qualifications: I am an archer and fletcher 
              in RL. At this point in my life I would also consider myself a master 
              archer, fletcher, and hunter. I have been involved in archery for 
              over 15 years (we are talking practice everyday for at least 2 hours), 
              have won many tournaments, slain many a mighty beast, and only use 
              arrows that I build myself. I am also have a Masters of Science 
              in mechanical engineering and have studied deeply the actual physics 
              behind archery. Now you are all thinking, wow, he is tooting his 
              horn pretty loud, but I am only trying to show you that I have alot 
              of experience with how bows and arrows work. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Let's 
              look at archery in the real world and in EQ. Many will say 'but 
              EQ is not the real world!' But EQ should closely follow the physics 
              of how archery works (ok, I can hear you thinking it, what about 
              the physics of magic? I won't touch that one ;) Anyhow, here goes: 
              Cheap arrow and a cheap bow--this combination as one would imagine, 
              will produce poor results. A sub-par arrow shaft will not be true 
              (perfectly straight) and thus when launched from the bow will spend 
              much of its energy into flexing and wobbling instead of propelling 
              itself forward at a high velocity, thus limiting its range and force 
              upon impact. A bow made of inferior components will also suffer 
              the same way, energy will not be effectively imparted to the arrow 
              because the defects in the bow will cause energy to be lost. If 
              the quality of the arrow and the bow are increased, the main result 
              is that energy is more effectively moved from the archer's muscles, 
              to the bow limbs, to the bow string, and into the arrow. This causes 
              the arrow to exit the bow at a higher velocity. Now anyone who has 
              had any kind of high school physics knows that more velocity equals 
              more energy equals more damage when the arrow strikes the target. 
              (if you want to understand exactly why, say so and I will explain 
              how kinetic energy and arrow velocity and energy work) Cams: these 
              little wonders were invented so that when an archer pulls the bow 
              back, a peak weight is reached (maximum draw weight) and then is 
              reduced at full draw. This is possible because of how a cam works; 
              by creating a lever arm (kind of like using a fulcrum) to help the 
              archer hold the full weight. Therefore the bow still has all the 
              energy of the peak draw weight stored in the limbs, yet the archer 
              can more easily hold the string back. This creates a couple of advantages: 
              the archer can hold the bow back for a longer period and thus take 
              more time to carefully aim before releasing. Generally speaking, 
              and archer using a cammed bow can also pull a bow having a higher 
              peak weight than if he/she were pulling a recurve bow; once again 
              adding more energy and range to the bow. The drawback to cams? Well, 
              a cammed bow is slower to shoot. Therefore we have the trade off 
              of (in EQ terms) damage versus delay. But, the damage more than 
              makes up for the delay and a more efficient arrow is shot. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Now 
              let's look at range a little since this seems to be debated quite 
              a bit. The overall range that an arrow will reach is determine by 
              both the quality of the arrow and the quality of the bow. Better 
              arrow plus better bow equals more range. Thus in my opinion, and 
              if we are trying to reflect true archery, the ranges should be additive, 
              i.e. range of the arrow plus range of the bow equals total range 
              that the arrow will fly. With my real life high quality bow and 
              arrows, it is not unrealistic for me to hit a target the size of 
              pop can at 50 yards consistently. Remember back to the previous 
              paragraph, a cammed, high quality bow will produce more energy and 
              fling an arrow farther. Thus, the highest quality bow with cams 
              will have the longest range and highest damages, BUT a longer delay. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">I 
              would also like to say that I would sure rather have a swordsman 
              take a whack at me than to have a skilled archer put an arrow into 
              my body. It is guaranteed that one well placed arrow will do more 
              that enough damgage to end your life (of course if the swordsman 
              swings across your neck and decapitates you, that will most likely 
              end your life also). But overall, and I would bet good money on 
              this, a single arrow is going to do a hell of a lot more damage 
              than a single swing of a hand to hand weapon. Not to mention that 
              armor is much more susceptible to penetration by a very small, pointy 
              object going at a very high velocity. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Everything 
              stated above is real world FACT. I have left out a grundle of details 
              that could fill a whole book but will spare you all the pain of 
              reading it. If you would however like more detail about a specific 
              aspect, I will more than gladly do my best to answer any questions. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Now, 
              MY OPINION regarding EQ: a single shot from a very high quality 
              bow with a high quality arrow should do more damage per round than 
              any other weapon in the game and have a better range. OUTRAGE!! 
              many will call. But remember, you will most likely only be flinging 
              one, two, maybe 3 (if you are very lucky) arrows at a target while 
              you will be swinging your sword at the same target many times. Thus 
              in the overall picture, the bow should do more damage per round, 
              but more damage overall should be done hand to hand. There should 
              be a good reason to spend a fortune to fletch up a steel shafted, 
              vaned, bladed arrow and shoot it through a very expensive, cammed 
              darkwood bow. This arrow should be doing damage on par with a decent 
              mage spell (which remember, cost only mana). Now I don't think that 
              arrow should be doing 200+ damage, but something on the scale of 
              50-70 is not unreasonable for an archer with 120+ skill. Not to 
              mention that this would be a great way to get money out of players 
              hands and back into the NPCs hands and take it out of circulation. 
              If you want a fast bow at the sacrifice of damage, you should be 
              using a recurve. If you want more damage and range at the expense 
              of speed (delay), than you should use a compound. This is NOT how 
              it works in EQ right now as cams produce less damage and more speed 
              WHICH IS DEAD WRONG if you are to model a real bow. I am not advocating 
              that archery become some God-like skill, but rather it be made more 
              reasonable to when compared to actual archery. I also love the idea 
              of questing or hunting for special components (both bow and arrow) 
              and being able to have enchanted arrows to be able to hit magic-only 
              creatures (thus creating the need for enchanters and rangers to 
              work together). So far this is my view on how the physics of doing 
              damage with archery should work; I will tackle the fletching skill 
              problems later. I have probably ranted more than my share here, 
              and will probably have more to say in the future so I will just 
              shut up for now ;) Please reply with constructive criticism and 
              other viewpoints. </font></p>
