              impromptu armor guide for Rangers</b> </font></p>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Well 
              here&#39;s a couple points on the different types of armor listed, 
              in order of ability to obtain. <br>
              <br>
              Well you have your plain ol&#39; banded, available from any smith. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Next we have blackened iron. This has the aperance of black chain 
              type armor. It has the same AC as chain, but weighs more. So it&#39;s 
              something like ring armor. You should be able to get this from the 
              home of the goblins near Rivervale around lvl 20. <br>
              <br>
              Then there&#39;s Blood Stained armor. This has the appearance of 
              red chain. There&#39;s only the tunic and mantle&#40;shoulders&#41; 
              available. The tunic is 13AC &#43;4WIS &#43;4AGI and the mantle 
              is &#43;3STR &#43;10SV Magic and weighs about the same as banded 
              I think. You should be able to get this in your mid 20&#39;s with 
              a good group. It&#39;s in an area of undead on Faydwer. <br>
              <br>
              Then we have rubicite. Prolly the first plate armor you&#39;ll be 
              getting. It has the same AC as normal store bought steel plate I 
              think, and is red in color. The brestplate has an effect called 
              rubicite auora which is supposed to double HP regen rate. You should 
              ba able to start getting this in your high 20&#39;s all the way 
              up to mid 30&#39;s for the brestplate. Be prepared to deal with 
              the crowds and Kill stealers in the area. You can find in in the 
              home of the lizzards on antonica. <br>
              <br>
              Now next we have silvered plate. Looks just like normal steel plate. 
              So far all I know of are the bracers&#40;7AC and I think &#43;7SV 
              Poision&#41; and the greaves&#40;stats unknown, but more ac than 
              the rubi greaves and some &#43; stats&#41; I&#39;m assumming you 
              can get a full set of silvered plate, but have no idea. You can 
              find it in the home of the froglocks on Antonica. And you&#39;ll 
              need to be in your 30&#39;s to 40&#39;s to get it <br>
              <br>
              Now the next stuff is vaguly heard of, and I&#39;m guessing on a 
              bit of it. There&#39;s a black enamelled brestplate, EQlizer states 
              that it has 25AC, but I have seen one before, it has the appearance 
              of black plate. Then there&#39;s blackened mail gloves&#40;&#43;5STA 
              and &#43;50mana&#41; Now these would be great for a Ranger, with 
              50 more mana, that&#39;s another Ignite and a half there. I think 
              these are supposed to show up as black, but it didn&#39;t look like 
              it on the person I saw them on. Green splinted plate mail is prolly 
              the best armor in the game, on one knows where it is, or what it&#39;s 
              stats are. <br>
              <br>
              Hope this helps <br>
