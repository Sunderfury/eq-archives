<b>Food trade “falls off a cliff” in central London</font></b></font></p>
<p valign="top" align="justify">Andrew Guy, the chief executive of City Centre Restaurants, claims that the food trade in central London has “fallen off a cliff” since the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September. City Centre, which operates the Garfunkel’s, Caffe Uno and Chiquito’s brands, has 26 restaurants in central London and has seen a 15 per cent drop in business in the past fortnight. Guy told <I>The Guardian</I>: “The problem is not just the big drop in foreign tourists, it is the fact that people seem to be sticking closer to home. They are not coming into the West End at all so casual, drop-in trade has been horrendous.”  <BR>
<BR>
Confirmation of the extent of the downturn in London has come from the St Martin’s Lane and Sanderson Hotel, where Americans make up 50 per cent of all guests. There was “an immediate downturn in bookings and a big run of cancellations” immediately after the attacks, according to Mark Allvey, sales and marketing director for both hotels. “We are in a crisis management situation. We are just trying to counteract the drop in overseas guests by concentrating on the domestic market. All we can really do is to attempt to stand still.”

<p valign="top" align="justify"><p>The British Institute of Innkeeping (BII) has revealed the details of its new Barperson's National Certificate (BNC) for staff across England and Wales.</p>

<p>The voluntary test covers all aspects of licensing law, including recent changes to the Criminal Justice and Police Act concerning bar staff's responsibilities with regards to serving alcohol, underage customers, drugs and dealing with the drunk and disorderly.</p>

<p>Bar staff are to be given a workbook to work through and, once they are confident of its content, will sit a 30 minute telephone assessment. If successful, they will receive an official, nationally recognised certificate.</p>

<p>The cost to licensees will be just £20 per bar worker. This amount was chosen because it was thought some employers would have been reluctant to enrol staff on a more expensive course. BII believe that licensees will be happy for bar staff to take the exam as it will impact on raising standards in their premises.</p>

<p>The BNC is intended to be the first module of a forthcoming Professional Barperson's Qualification. Two new modules associated with the professional role of bar staff will be available in the New Year.</p>

<b>Business briefs - Friday</font></b></font></p>
<p valign="top" align="justify">Fuller Smith and Turner is calling time on its late-night bars after deciding it is too expensive to keep up with the ever-changing youth market. The real ale brewer wants to sell its seven Boardwalk pubs and two late-night bars after investing £7 million in the concepts over the last three years. The outlets have failed to achieve an acceptable return on investment and management feel the capital would be better spent on its core brewing business. The company is already in talks with interested parties. London-based Fuller’s also warned that year-end profits would suffer because of a drop in demand for its hotel bedrooms because of the New York outrages. The company has also been hit by eight-week delays to the opening of new flagship hotels in London and Bristol. <BR>
<BR>
Wolverhampton & Dudley has revealed it cost £9 million to defend itself from the year-long hostile campaign to buy it. The majority of the money was split between Wolves’ financial adviser NM Rothschild and its joint broker ABN Amro and HSBC. “That’s what it costs to defend a company of this size,“ said Ralph Findlay, Wolves’ chief executive. The company said current trading was in line with forecasts and the company had seen no significant impact after the terrorist attacks in the US.

<b>Internet café chain teeters on the brink</font></b></font></p>
<p valign="top" align="justify">Stelios Haji-Ioannou saved the Easyeverything internet café chain from going bust yesterday with an investment of £15 million. The company had simply run out of money after burning through £40 million since the first outlet was opened in London in June 1999. The injection of cash, for which Haji-Ioannou receives 1.5 billion new shares worth a penny each, means the company is worth just one per cent of its original value. The bail-out will mean that some branches abroad and some in the UK will close. In-store concessions for coffee and food, printing and copying will be ended and staff may be replaced by ticket machines.<BR>
<BR>
The chain, which has 22 outlets, is expected to concentrate on London, New York and Paris and will focus on a no-frills internet service. “We get 22 million customers annually who spend an average of an hour,” Haji-Ioannou said. But the costs of dealing with those customers were higher than the £1 they paid for that hour. His objective now was to cut cost to 90p for every £1 of income. The £15 million investment values the company at just £15.8 million – a huge reduction in its value from 1999. It is thought that fresh investment may be needed in the next couple of months to keep the company afloat. “It’s another roll of the dice. It’s double or quits,“ said Haji-Ioannou.

A bed and breakfast in Ambleside, Cumbria, which successfully revamped its bedrooms to occupy a niche area in the market has been sold for an undisclosed price. The owners of Ambleside Lodge, Nigel and Jackie Gorton, converted the building into a “boutique bed and breakfast” offering Jacuzzi spas in many of the bedrooms. The new owners, Bernard Houssin and Sabrina Davies, from Fakenham, Norfolk, successfully ran a similar operation in Brighton. Substantial offers were invited on the business and several “underbidders” were disappointed.

<b>Stockwatch - Friday</font></b></font></p>
<p valign="top" align="justify">The FTSE 100 enjoyed its third consecutive day of increases yesterday, advancing 67.5 points to 4,763.6 as investors shrugged off the latest gloomy news from America to go bargain hunting among the stocks most likely to prove resilient in a recession. Equity salesmen were kept busy with 2.6 billion shares changing hands  <BR>
<BR>
The restaurant, pub and brewery sector enjoyed a healthy 3.48 per cent rise in value. <b>Allied Domecq</b> and <b>Diageo</b> both attracted investors because of their impressive range of spirits brands, which continue to gain market share in the UK and elsewhere. Allied Domecq added 14.5p to end a 368.5p while Diageo rose 15p to finish on 705p. Buyers showed a healthy appetite for <b>Compass</b>, the world’s largest contract caterer, adding 37p for a finish of 453p. The rise was linked to an expected trading statement from Compass that would reassure the City about its reliable earnings in times of recession. Its shares nosedived after investors grew concerned that a recession in the US would mean corporate contracts dry up. But analysts insist that Compass is well placed to weather any storm in the US.<BR>
<BR>
<b>Fullers</b> dropped 35p to 390p after forecasts for full-year profits were slashed by £2 million. <b>PizzaExpress</b> edged up 7.5p to 740p while <b>Luminar</b> ticked up 5p to finish on 725p. <b>Six Continents</b> fell away 12p to end on 602p after more gloomy news from the hotel sector. <b>Wolverhampton & Dudley</b> rose 6p to end on 478p after shareholders were told that the company was on target to meet full-year profit figures.

<b>The Cavern car park inspires fashion and food</font></b></font></p>
<p valign="top" align="justify"><p>A £2m retail development will be built on a famous car park in Liverpool's Matthew Street.</p>

<p>When work gets underway on the project, later this year, builders will be constructing the new project on the site where the original Cavern Club is believed to have stood - the venue famed for many of the Beatles' first gigs.</p>

<p>The four-storey glass-fronted building will feature a glass lift on the outside and, although the names of prospective tenants have yet to be named, developers Iliad Group are looking to foster a burgeoning fashion quarter around Matthew Street by attracting some of the biggest names in retail style.</p>

<p>"Our plan is to have all four levels plus a basement selling fashion," said a spokesman for Iliad. "Young professionals looking for designer clothes are sometimes forced to look beyond Liverpool. We feel there's a need for more of these kinds of shops in the city."</p>

<p>It is likely the 13,000 sq ft building will also house cafes and offices above the shops, for which planning permission has been agreed. Paul Falconer, a partner in Liverpool architects Falconer Chester, in charge of the project, believes the development represents "part of the new mood in the city", though he is less convinced of the authenticity of the site's history: "It's in a great location but I am not so sure it's the original home of the Cavern," he said. "We'd heard all the tales too, but a Matthew Street address is still one of the most famous in the world."</p>
