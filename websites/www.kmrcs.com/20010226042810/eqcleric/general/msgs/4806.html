You shouldnt worry, life gets better at 19th.  In addition, there are good places for you to solo safely if you wish.  Around your level you can fight in East Karana, gorge hounds are great exp, or the gnoll camp in Lake Rathe which spawns undead at night.  <p>All this talk about slow leveling and no groups makes no sense to me.  I went from 20 to 30 with no difficulty.<p>Meet some friends that play the same hours and form your own little group.  If you have only soloed up to here you need to focus on grouping going forward.
