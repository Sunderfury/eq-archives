If they are rare, then a farmer can make a route that lets him pick up several pieces with perfect timing as they spawn.  Then he auctiosn them off for 500 plat each.<p>Bad idea. Just make them spawn every 5 min like the ice comet quest pieces that appear on the ground.<p><p>: Sure the ARMOR can be No Drop. But the ingots and icons..
