We were unbeatable!<p>One thing I've noticed is that the PURE classes such as pure tanks (monk/warrior), pure casters (wizzies/enchanters/necros), and pure healers (clerics) can be very effective, if not more effective than several hybrids.  However, you have to have at least a few of each for the group to work.  Hybrids are great when you don't have enough pures or to round out the party (can't be those shaman buffs for example).<p>The monk was telling me that he was with 5 casters in the Upper Throne Room in Cazic!
