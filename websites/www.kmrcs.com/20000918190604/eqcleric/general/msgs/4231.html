Just like to point out, that there are places in the higher level dungons, solusek B for example, where even fully dressed, well organized and prepaired it can take more then 2 hours to get there the first time.

: Just like to point out, that there are places in the higher level dungons, solusek B for example, where even fully dressed, well organized and prepaired it can take more then 2 hours to get there the first time. Now if something then goes wrong, it is not hard to infer that it would take more then 2 hours to get to the corpse there even with another fully dressed group of friends you were able to call to help.

: I'd also like to point out in case you dont know, no invsibility spell works in this dungon.

: For many zones, lowerguk for example, it is feasable to get a corpse from anywhere in the zone within 2 hours, since you can just invis (if you feel lucky) run in and drag it back out, but since there are some places in some zones where there is no realiztic chance of one getting their corpse within 2 hours, perhapse the limit should be different for that zone or perhapse based upon the deadperson or cleric's level.
