ammended, sorry...Yeah i noticed that too, its really discouraging that there is such blatent bias against Dark Elf Clerics, here is another one, Lynuga's quest not really a quest but Dwarf Clerics that would be KoS to her can use the Mid-Night Mallet but not Dark Elves its suppose to be an evil quest I thought and now this with the armor it really sucks, and a massive amount of frustration knowing that there isn't much to look forward to.<p>
