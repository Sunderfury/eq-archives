It affects our mezmerize line.  It may affect our mem blur line.  It also effects our charm spells.<p>It affects the corresponding bard charm and mez songs.<p>It will not affect you as a cleric. HOWEVER, if he casts Tashan/Tashani/Tashania on the mob before hand it will lower the magic resist of them mob.  ALL cleric spells go against magic resist for resists.  As do ALL enchanter spells.  Spells such as root, lightning, blade, all go against magic resist as well.
