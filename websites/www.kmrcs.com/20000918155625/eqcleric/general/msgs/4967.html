: Just picking up on this point.

: : Of the 4 abilities that aid in shortening a combat or running away:
: : (DOT, Debuffs, SOW, and Dmg Shields) a cleric has none and a Shaman or Druid has 3 of the 4...

: These are not the only ones,other ones (Cleric specific)

: Root- buys you time to run ,(Druids have snare line shamen also have root)removes a mob from battle for a while

: Fear- Makes the mob run from you

: Lull- reduce battle odds

: Buffs-increases the amount of time you can remain in battle,and thus the chances of winning.

: Flash of light-blinds mob buys time to run

: Stun-Most effective against casters but also good against hard hitting mobs.

: DD- Comparable efficiency at some levels.

: Guess the formula just changed ;)

: But at the end of the day what matters is that the person playing knows how to use the strenghts and abilities of their class to the best advantage for the group.
