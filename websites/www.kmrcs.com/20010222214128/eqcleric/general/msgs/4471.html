: I really thought our petition went in the wrong direction in a number of areas.  I posted before the petition was sent that the 'stun' aspect of DA was to prevent it from being a complete 'get out of jail' card.  I think GZ had a similar view.

: Issues I really thought need addressing;

: The Holy Armor line is inefficient and compares very poorly to the valor line.
: Spell delays on some spells are very strange, what's up with the 10 second delay on Resist Magic?
: Revive line has really been nerfed yet it still cost a bundle to cast.
: I think we should get regen but I saw the reasoning on not giving it.
: Group buff spells.

: I only disagree with you on the Undead spells for one reason.  There are very few good clerics, many clerics like to make the most of their damage capabilities and fail to focus on why ever group wants them.   On a whole, the cleric players are getting better as the servers mature but it seems to take them awhile to learn that a 300 point heal will cause more damage to the MOB than a 300 point DD spell.
