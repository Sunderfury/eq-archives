I haven't been there in a long time, but there is a small island just off the dock where all the Kerrans hang out (this is actually in the kerra ridge zone).  There were 2 necros standing around doing... who knows what.  You might want to check and see if they have replaced these generic npc necros with the one you are looking for.  Good Luck.<p>: I know I saw this info the other day, but I seem to have forgotten where I saw it.  For the part of Penitent where you need to kill Erudite heretic Maugarim, which island is the actual Kerra Ridge.  I, like many others, have not spent a lot of time on this boring side of the world.  I thought that the person the mentioned it also said that the npc spawns once an hour, on the shore.  I have forgotten though.  Any info on this is appreciated.  Thanks.<p>: Lunara Silvermoon<br>: Quellious<p>
