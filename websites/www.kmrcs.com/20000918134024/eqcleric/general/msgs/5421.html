You are wrong on the str, it is -9, but you are dead right on the rest.

This armor debacle has me so angry, I can't concentrate.  <p>: I just can't fekkin believe we've been hosed over like this. <p>: They actually expect us to pay bars of platinum (cost to me, 113pp) to wear armor that's marginally better than the bronze most of us adorne.<p>: All the while, other classes like Bards, Rangers, Shamans, hell ALL of them, even Wizards,, are out there cranking out thier new armor pieces like an assembly line.  <p>: A ranger guildmate of mine already has both his new bracers!  <p>: To make matter worse, I read a post on EQVault, concerning the named Aqua Goblin that spawns in Dagnor's Cauldron.  It drops a totem that has the following stats (-6 str, +18 wis)  Str may be off, but the +18 is definately right on the money.  So, as a result, OUR named Aqua Goblin is currently being GANG camped by every 40+ Shaman & Druid in the game. <p>: Verant, I'm about to give up.
