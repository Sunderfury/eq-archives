I agree, the stats blow, but I want all gold and my black Basalt Carapace BP (yeah I know i am cheap but gold and black will look pimp).  People will be like wow, nice armor.  Working on the legs currently.  Thankfully stumpwatching is not so bad on our server I guess since not a lot of clerics on Quellious read this server.<p>: Who cares about the stats? The only reason I'm getting all the pieces is so that I look different than all the other players out there. Can't you see verant is trying to color-code all the classes? <G><p>: : Might I now point it out to everyone that these boots suck. 9 AC and 6 Vs Disease? Dwarven Workboots are better than these, and Bronze is damn close. Stop the stumpwatching already it just isn't worth it.<p>: : Same goes for the Penitent, I was thinking about trying to complete that quest again (failed the first time), but then I realized that it would useless because the Greaves of the Penitent are 5 int and 5 Vs Poison.<p>: : Yes I know, we've been over how badly most of the stats suck, I just can't figure out why everyone is still stumpwatching for the Crappiest Boots in Norrath.<p><br>
