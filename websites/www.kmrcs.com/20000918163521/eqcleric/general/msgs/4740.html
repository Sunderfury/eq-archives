Other than the pricing, I'd say you have the right idea about charging for resurrecting.<p>For the 29th level spell, I treat it like a teleport.  Most wizzies charge 10 plat to <br>get to where they want to go, so I do too.  I limit it to 10 plat even if I have to go to <br>them, cause even wizards have to take time out of their play to serve as a taxi.<p>For the 39th level spell  (which I can't cast yet), I intend to charge 10 plat for the <br>transporting of the person to his soul and another 10 to save some experience.<p>For the 49th level spell, I'll charge far more than 20, but undecided at this point.<p>Regarding being pestered after you tell them your price, my advice is to use Ignore.
