Once you have ensured that you will have enough saved up or have already purchased your next rank of spells, you can make a choice to start purchasing new equipment.  Obviously the items that will be the most beneficial with be the +wis increasing items (ears, rings & items that are held).  As far as other items like boots sleeves BP's that kinda stuff, it is up to the individual to decide what they can afford and if they want to buy it.  I myself have been looking to buy a silver ruby veil (+4 str +4 wis) but haven't found one that is in my price range.  99% of the time they are selling for 200-250 plat.  After having just purchased my level 24 spells not long ago, I find myself with about 150 plat left over - not nearly enough to buy a silver ruby veil.  There are a lot of nice equipment/armor pieces out there but it is up to you to decide what you want to purchase and so forth.  Weapon wise, I wouldn't spend very much.  Typically we don't spend a lot of time meleeing so if you have a decent weapon, stick with it and don't shell out the big bucks for a really nice weapon until you can afford it.  I happened to have a little extra and went ahead and purchased a glowing wooden crook - cost me 140 plat but it's a good 2h blunt weapon that should last until I have enough or am able to do the observer staff quest.  Not knowing exactly what you have for equipment, I would look to invest in minimum of 2 +3 wis ears, and 2 +wis rings (however much you can afford to buy).  If you go to the areas where some of the nice items are dropped, it's possible that you can pick up items fairly cheaply.  Blackened iron medalion is nice also - +3 wis +3 int.  If you want to make some serious cash, you can hunt wisps.  If you want more details about this feel free to post a email and I will reply to you on what to do.<p>Good luck<p><br>: <br>:  <p>
