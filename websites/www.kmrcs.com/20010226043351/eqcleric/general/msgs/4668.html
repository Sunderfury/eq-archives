: LOL now this is funny.

: Ya say all we can do is heal which isn't true.  Ya ever see a cleric who stuns (with stackables) to interrupt casters, mass fears for evacs, roots runners, buffs (best HP/AC buffs in the game), heals, the list goes on.

: Now if ya wanna talk about dueling, you definately aren't one to talk.

: Warriors by far are the easiest pickins, hell I'll say Warriors are easier to kill than finding foraged food.

: Apparently you must of only dueled those clerics ya like i.e just heal LOL.

: Hah so easy.

: Stun/blind, DD move...
: Holy Might/blind DD move...
: Force/blind, DD move...

: And if ya get to close and ya got bad breath, theres always sending ya off a cliff with fear.

: Rinse and repeat = 1 dead warrior, 1 triumphant cleric.

: : : The fact he didn't tell us his name and server states that in fact he finds clerics VERY important.

: : There ya go buddy......
: : Never find me needing a cleric since druids/shamans heal fine and can add more to the group..
: : actually, there are few clerics there that understand their job is to heal and be quiet.. Those mules are great.. they can come

: : So if find me, what do I care??  and if you try to duel me, you will die
