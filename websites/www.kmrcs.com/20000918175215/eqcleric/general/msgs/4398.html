: Snare is SO cool. Yes, if they bitch it will most likely get nerfed.  It will not be upgraded.  Just like the root series.

: Root
: Enstill - Root possibly twice as long
: Next one - root but quicker
: next one - Root possibly 4 times as long

: Duration or casting time would be upgraded.  But you will have a trade off.  The longer lasting use more mana and take longer to cast. The quicker casting has same effect for more mana.

: After charm breaks the mob attacks them? Hehe...ask an enchanter about when charm breaks. It will not taunt off ever..and we don't have the AC to handle that nor the HP. We do have memory blur...but not snare or sow.

: Um...doubt dot's will go back the way they were unless verant makes a special druid server. Kiting was unbalancing and not intended. They spent a LONG time thinking about that before they put it in...they would stick with it even if it was chock full of bugs that cause you to lose all your equipment if a DoT was cast on you in a duel.  They are that committed to that change.

: These druids can be laughable at times. =p

: Best of luck to them though.  Everytime an enchanter asks for something reasonable we get 5 nerfs in return.  Hate to see what they do when they see this =p

: Actually I know what they will do.  They will post it by the soda machine and take turns laughing at it. It's what I would do.
