I know tons of level 50s that have a lot of practice points left, but really no use for them other than to start trade skills.  Many are waiting for the expansion pack to see if new skills will become available- or a trade skill that gets fixes to make something worthwhile.<p>The best place to use them is to make sure you get the specialization that you want, once that becomes avaialable to you, and trade skills.  All the rest go up nicely on their own after spending one point in them.  Heck, even my conjuration skill is up there now (after I sat around and summond about 1000 food and water for some peeps in w comm tunnel to n ro)<br>
