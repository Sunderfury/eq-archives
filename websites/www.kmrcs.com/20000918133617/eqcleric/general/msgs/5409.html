I have a theory about why some people seem to lose their connection at least once every time they play (like me) and why others almost never lose their connection (like my brother).<p>My brother and I both play on the Fennin Ro server out of Qeynos.  He is a Monk and I am--obviously--a Cleric.  I carry a bunch a gear with me at all times.  I have spells, a weapon, shield, food, bags, armor, etc.  The point is I am always carrying a ton of items at all times.  I tend to lose my connection to EQ at least one to three times every time I play EQ.  It never fails; it ALWAYS happens.<p>My brother, who is a Monk, carries almost nothing with him.  He has only food, milk, and a  fire beetle eye--that's it.  He has lost his connection, as a Monk, to EQ a grand total of TWO times.  Both on seperate occasions and both far apart.  He can go long stretchs and connection losses are never a problem.  <p>We both use the SAME computer, SAME Cable Modem, SAME EQ account, and the SAME ISP provider.<p>So why do we have such very very different EQ experiences?  I think it's tied into how much your character is carrying!  I think the less your character carries the less likely you are to lose your connection.  Why this is I still haven't figured out, but from what I've seen, using myself and my brother as test subjects, this is the answer I've come across.  <p>Any comments?  :)

: I have a theory about why some people seem to lose their connection at least once every time they play (like me) and why others almost never lose their connection (like my brother).

: My brother and I both play on the Fennin Ro server out of Qeynos.  He is a Monk and I am--obviously--a Cleric.  I carry a bunch a gear with me at all times.  I have spells, a weapon, shield, food, bags, armor, etc.  The point is I am always carrying a ton of items at all times.  I tend to lose my connection to EQ at least one to three times every time I play EQ.  It never fails; it ALWAYS happens.

: My brother, who is a Monk, carries almost nothing with him.  He has only food, milk, and a  fire beetle eye--that's it.  He has lost his connection, as a Monk, to EQ a grand total of TWO times.  Both on seperate occasions and both far apart.  He can go long stretchs and connection losses are never a problem.  

: We both use the SAME computer, SAME Cable Modem, SAME EQ account, and the SAME ISP provider.

: So why do we have such very very different EQ experiences?  I think it's tied into how much your character is carrying!  I think the less your character carries the less likely you are to lose your connection.  Why this is I still haven't figured out, but from what I've seen, using myself and my brother as test subjects, this is the answer I've come across.
