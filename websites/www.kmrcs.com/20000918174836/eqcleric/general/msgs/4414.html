In Reply to: <a href="4400.html">Re: Some druids are petitioning</a> posted by Druid on October 06, 1999 at 14:25:50:<p>
Having played a cleric and a druid to high levels, I honestly feel that the druid has very little to complain about.  They are one of the sweetest classes out there and it truly does pay to be a druid.  As far as these petitions, these are my thoughts.<p><br>: : Their complaints are:<p>: : <li>The spells after Snare are not as good, so they want them upgraded<p>: Druid Response :<br>: Incorrect. I believe that the petition was that we have spell upgrades that are useless.  (Snare is later upgraded to ensnare.  However, ensnare is not as good as snare, which makes it a useless upgrade.  Our root spells also go up ensnaring roots, grasping roots, etc.  These also are not effective upgrades.  They cost a LOT more mana then the basic root, do pitiful damage, and do not last ANY longer then the basic root (which is not very long).<p>Snare is one of the best spells in the game, without a doubt.  Much better than root and much more reliable when it takes hold.  Snare wasn't even nerfed in pvp unlike the overrated root.  I don't see how this spell could possibly be upgraded since it is already overpowered in my opinion.<p><br>: : <li>Evidently they get attacked by a charmed animal after the charm wears off.  No comment</li><p>: Druid Response :<br>: Yes we do.  It is annoying for us to get charm spells and yet not have the CHA or whatever to make them last for longer then 45 seconds.  It ends up that these spells are used for novalty and bordom rather then as a tactic in battle.  If these spells actually lasted a minumum of say 2 minutes (with the same random length after that), they would then become useful as a tactic.. even if they were made to be resisted twice as hard as they are now.<p>Personally I think GZ has a real thing for enchanters and guards them jealously.  That's why they get the constant upgrades and that's why they get so much special treatment by the development team including daily updates from GZ himself to the Enchanter Message Board.  That's why I think Necros and shaman lost charm and why Charm Animal was nerfed hard.  Personally, though, I think Druids are powerful enough without getting pet griffins to toy with even if it is only for 2 minutes.<p>: <br>: : <li>They want their DoTs restored to the previous behavior and damage.</li><p>: Yes.  Why do you ask.  Simple.  Because the "extra tick of damage" is NOT implemented.  We do NOT get more damage standing still.  This has been tested MANY TIMES.  If we cast it on a creature where the HPS are known and stand there and let the mob hit us, it now does 2/3 the damage it used to.  So yes, we want it back the way it was.. because it is obvious they lied.<br>: -----------------<p>I really wish they'd have just left things alone.  Druids being able to kite to 50th quickly really doesn't bother me.  I think they're cheating themselves actually.  Brad and GZ are just too egotistical to see their game played in a way they didn't intitially envision.  Add that to the fact that clerics get bent over in about every patch, and I pretty much think they both suck.<p>: Other druids want things that ARE unreasonable, like permanent wolf pets for example.<p>: I would actually like to see a few druid changes myself:<p>: 1> A ring Surefall Glade (teleport) and a Circle Surefall Glade (group teleport)<p>This would be nice.  Of course, they won't add it.<p>: 2> A Succor Affinity spell (Group emergency teleport to the Druid's bind spot)<p>I think this would be a nice addition too, but I think you'd get the typical moron response from GZ and Brad, "it would affect game balance."  Translation: it would make the game less tedious and we don't like that for some reason.<p>: 3> A Werewolf Form at high levels (It is obvious that the graphics are in place for this since enchanters get a werewolf illusion.. so we druids would like it VERY MUCH)<p>Have to disagree in a big way here.  I think this would be a big roleplaying faux pas.  Druids are the guardians of nature, hence their affinity with wolves.  Werewolves seem more like an abomination of nature that druids would shun.  Lycanthropy seems to be the result of some unnatural magic in my opinion so druids would be horrified at taking the form of a werewolf.  Besides...wolf form is much cooler than werewolf form.<p>: 4> A 44th level Heal Spell (call it Nature's Gift or something that gives 550hp for 300 mana. - Making it less mana efficient then superior healing, at a higher level, and gives us druids the ability to save your cleric's butt when the fit hits the shan.)<p>No.  They should not get this.  Clerics don't get regeneration, druids should not get a form of superior healing.  They would be ridiculously powerful.  Clerics are already pissed off enough that Skin Like Nature is better than any buff they can produce.  Very sore point =|<p>: <br>: But to tell you the truth, I like my druid fine the way he is.  Even as a human druid (yes I get teased by the halflings a lot :P).<p>You should...Druids just plain rock.  FYI, Wood Elves are the true druids, halflings are just a bad imitation thereof....so don't let them give you any guff.<p>: Too bad on your petition I think that the divine aura SHOULD NOT be stunned (or at least the higher level version should not).  Oh well...<p>Amen to that.  But as I explained before, GZ is a closed minded twit who seems only to be interested in improving enchanters.<p>: This is a lurking Druid,<p>: Bidding adieu.<p>
