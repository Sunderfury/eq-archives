: Ok, the spell line lull -> soothe -> calm, etc is supposed to let you pull one mob from a group of mobs, correct?  Well every single time I try that it doesn't work and they all end up coming after me.<p>: Example:  I see a room with 3 elite goblin guards.  I calm two of them sucessfully (they look less aggerssive it says) so then I smite the 3rd (I also tried walking up to the 3rd and attacking it) and every time they ALL come after me.<p>: What am I doing wrong?<p>Waiting too long, I would suppose.  I think the<br>Lull line has a fairly short duration to it.  I've<br>seen at lower levels that I could successfully lull<br>one mob, but trying to lull two or more usually<br>results in a mass rush.  I think that by the time<br>you recover, cast another, recover from that, then<br>pull, the Lulls have worn off.  If anyone has any<br>definitive timing info on this, I bet everyone<br>would be eager to see it.<p>Gorgrim<p>: Thanks,<br>: Vinlaen of Rallos Zek (lvl 20)<p>
