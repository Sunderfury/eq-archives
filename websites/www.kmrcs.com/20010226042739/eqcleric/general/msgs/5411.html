You have the right lense, but you have to get really drunk in real life and give 500pp to Bandayd Woundmender who stands in a burnt down house 6 hours a day and give him the evil eye lense.  You will receive a Cracked Staff and your faction increases with "Bandayd Woundmender and the Slayers of Slaw".  Then you walk up to the Gnome in Steamfont and click on him and press 'A' with the cracked staff in your hand.  He will award you with some Exp loss and a teleport back to your bind point.  You will then have the observer's staff.<p>: Ello der, Oi jus kilt ol Borxx da udder night, an looted an Evil Eye Lens off a him. I know where oi gots take da lens to ta get an observer staff, but oi'm worried it aint da right lens. Does Borxx drop a lens called "Borxx Lens" or is the one oi looted from him, called "Evil Eye Lens", da right one?<p>: <br>: Tank Ye!!<p>: Vetch Holyale<br>: Drunken Dwarven Cleric :-D<p>
