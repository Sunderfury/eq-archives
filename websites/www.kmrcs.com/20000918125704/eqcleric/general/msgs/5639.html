Well I had a.....discussion on guildchat last night about this subject, so I thought I would post my ideas and see what all of the other clerics out there think.<p>A member of my noble guild mentioned how he hated &#8216;bad clerics&#8217; because a cleric is the clothespin that keeps a group attached to string of life. I responded with &#8220;Well I don&#8217;t mind bad clerics, because I make it a point to steer clear of them. What bothers me are one-sided clerics who use a single strategy all of the time.&#8221; Then a cleric in my guild said that he only heals all of the time and asked whether or not I had a problem with that. Needless to say, this discussion continued. Unfortunately, we were not able to arrive at a consensus.<p>My major arguments boiled down to this. For me, the two greatest aspects of being a cleric are &#8220;being the hero&#8221; and the variety of roles that you play depending on the situation. A cleric is in the unique (in certain situations other classes can achieve this as well) of being able to heal, blast and tank. But to use his or her abilities to their utmost, the cleric must adapt his use of them to fit his party and/or situation.<p>I have been in groups where I&#8217;ve been the best blaster and I&#8217;ve been in groups where I&#8217;ve been the best tank. A good cleric&#8217;s strategy depends on the monsters he or she fights and the abilities of his or her group. Now some might think this truth to be self-evident. It is obvious that every member of a group should know the abilities of other classes and the peculiarities of the specific people in his or her group. One must know everyone else to properly put oneself into a role. But I argue that this is doubly important for a cleric because of the adaptability of the class. If the life and well-being of the party is a cleric&#8217;s responsibility (I do not know about any of you, but my character assumes this), then a cleric should know when to hold em, know when to fold em, know when to walk away and know when to run. If you&#8217;re fighting a festering hag or a ghoul wizard, &#8220;expeling&#8221; it might protect the party a bit better than waiting for it to blast a party member so you can heal him or her.<p>Now all of this is coming from the perspective of a human cleric. It might very well be the case that a high elf or a halfling is much more limited in his or her ability to be effective in different capacities. Furthermore, one&#8217;s equipment might make a certain strategy more efficient in most situations. Both of these things are quite possible. However, being a human cleric with a well-balanced set of armor and weapons, I make it a point to be flexible. There is always something to learn that will help me be a better cleric. Versatility allows betterment and excludes boredom: how a cleric can think himself a cleric if all he does is stand/heal/sit over and over again is beyond me.<p>-Erasmus Gotterdammerung: Humble Servant of the Twins, Hall of Truth (Tarew Marr Server)<br>
