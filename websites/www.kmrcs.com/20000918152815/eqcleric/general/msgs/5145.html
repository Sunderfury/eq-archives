I have had several different guilds over the last 4 months because many of the people that I used to group with are no longer playing their characters.  You do get a reputation as being a good or bad cleric.  This can really help or really hurt your chances of getting a good group.  It can also get you invited on a lot more Giant or Dragon runs, which are a blast IMO.  <p>I've seen clerics who, just like any other class, jump up and blame someone else when it all goes wrong, and that gets them in trouble too.  When a druid targetted the wrong thing and decided to cast on an Efreeti run, it got 15 people killed.  He was very sorry, and told everyone- no hard feelings, but another druid who wanted a chance at the boots wanted to go with the next party that came for corpse recovery.  It was agreed that the new team would go for the Efretti after reviving/ressing the rest of our team, but this guy just wouldn't let it drop.  He hasn't been back since, and maybe never will.<p>You can always start a new character, but you really have a hard time repairing a reputation- be a nice person and do a good job and you'll always have a spot open.<br>
