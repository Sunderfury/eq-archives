Okay.... last night I was in my spot in East Karana and was fighting lion patriarch/matriarch, carrion spiders and carrion snakes (all blue to me).  I had cast a DD spell at a carrion spider and really wasn't paying much attention to the crag spider near by.<p>I started pulling the spider over to the out of the way spot I hunt and I noticed that the crag spider changed directions and was hauling butt towards me!<p>Ummmmm..... Oh Oh!<p>So I started casting gate as fast as I could switch hot keys and on the 4th attempt was able to gate away (with both spiders whomping on me).<p>So my question is.... are spiders linked?  I remember fighting them in Misty Thickets and East/West Commons but don't remember if one would come to the other's aide...<p>So I calm down, heal and med up and wander back over to the hunting site.   The crag is still in the area and I con'ed it (red..ready to attack..tombstone).  So I'm looking for something blue and I see the friendly Hill Giant wander over the rise, so I back away from that direction and towards the crag and it charges me and beats me up again.<p>Another question... if I kill enough carrion spiders will the carrion and crag start attacking me on sight?<p>Please advise<br>Callin
