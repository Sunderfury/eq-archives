: Hiya,

: Here is my take on the armor/quests and what we might do:

: The quests are both frustrating and time consuming for established clerics past level 25 or so. If these quests had been in place from day one, we'd all have compleated them as we'd progressed in levels. We'd likely have collected the items as we'd gone along, rather than all trying to hunt the same creatures that give none of us XP anymore. The stats in the armor are better than bronze, a little better than plate, but not better than the magic items we'd find in the Sol dungeons or Lower Guk or obviously Plane of Fear. While the price is pretty high, I think we could 

: If you do want to see things changed, I don't think Verant will respond to a &quot;Petition&quot;. GZ already hinted that Verant hates that term, since it comes across as a demand. I think we'd be better off with sending feedback discussing how we're dissapointed. Here is an example of what I mean:

: &quot;The new cleric armor quests suck! The Armor sucks! Fix this!&quot;

: I think anyone from Verant will stop reading when they encounter this kind of language. And if you start cussing them out, threatening to leave or protest, its even more likely they'll stop listening. Instead, try:

: This is just my opinion. I would like to believe that the people at Verant genuinely care about the quality of their game. I certainly hope that if enough of us express dissapointment in the quests they will listen and make some sort of adjustment or at least discuss the subject with us.

: I believe we have to take the high road on this as a group. We must make are desires known through the channels Verant provides us. Getting upset is understandable, we just shouldn't show it.

: My opinion of course, I could be wrong. :)
