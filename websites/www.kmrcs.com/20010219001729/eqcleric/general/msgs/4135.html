You may also want to consider helping put one or two of the mobs down quickly by throwing in a few nukes. If you can reduce the number of mobs in play before you need to heal, you get a lot less mobs getting mad at you.<p>Also keep both DA and DB memorized. The anti tougnt effect and the few seconds of inv has kept me in the battle quite a few times, and on a couple of occations I have had to use both in one fight. Try to heal you tanks up as much as poss before using it though unless you have a backup healer (not being able to heal your tanks becouse you can't cast isnt a situation you want to get into unless there is no altenative). Also set up a hot key to let your party know that you can't cast and can't be cast on.
