For xp, fight mino's in Beholder. For loot, fight undead<br>in Unrest. But you really have a lot of options... Spend<br>a few days just exporing different zones til you find one <br>you like.<p><br>: I know this question has been beaten to death and I appologize for once again asking it... but where is the best spots for a lvl 20 cleric to fight for exp and where is the best spot for loot?  I've been fighting in high hold with the orcs and gnolls but now they are almost all green to me.  But instead of soloing I'd much rather go to a much harder place and group up and get decent exp and good loot.  I remember hearing some good things east karana, but I have never been there so I'm not too familiar with the zone.<p>: Thanks again,<br>: Vinlaen of Rallos Zek (lvl 20)<p>
