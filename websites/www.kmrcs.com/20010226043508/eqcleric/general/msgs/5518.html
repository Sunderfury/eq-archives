Let's see.. last low character I had at level 5 I went to the Everfrost side of Blackburrow and killed the little guards at the top.  Even with another level 5 rogue with my little level 5 warrior, we gained level 6 in an hour or 2.  Every gnoll would move the exerience bar.  You should be able to take all 4 without too much trouble or much of a rest.  By the time they respawn, you should have mana again.  You should be able to melee the gnolls fine and save mana for healing, not blasting.  There's a barb warrior that might help you (if he's there and not killing spiders or something).<p>At level 6, head back inside again and take out the scrawnies for a level or 2.  <p>At level 7 or 8, head down to the bridge and hang out under it or on top of the rock.<p>At level 9 or 10, you can start heading up to the snakes but be careful of the guardmen.  Some of them are pretty big.<p>At level 10, take out guardsmen near the snake pit (the spikey place) or move on to West Karana.<p>At level 12 move to North Karana.<p>At level 15 move to East Karana until you're either bored out of your wits or about 22-23.<p>This whole process should take about 3-4 hours per level until 15.  Then things start slowing a bit but not by a huge amount.  It mainly depends on your source of monsters and how many other people are hunting them.<p>Whatever you do, DON'T DIE!  You waste so much time by dying that it's not worth it.  I haven't died in 3 levels and then 10 levels before that.  Keep Divine Aura memorized and use it to run away to the zone.  Shout train if you have to but don't worry about turning tail and getting out of there.
