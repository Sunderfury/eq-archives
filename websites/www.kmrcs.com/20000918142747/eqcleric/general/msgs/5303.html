Did you tell him the Testament is a no drop too.. and that he is wasting his time?<p>: Don't worry - he's an easy kill...<p>: The real problem is that he is camped 24 hours a day. I came by the other day, as I always do when I am in the neighbourhood, only to find the spawn camped as always but this time by a Erudite Necromancer (?). I asked how long he had waited. The answer was 5 1/2 hours. 5 1/2 hour long wait for a quest item that his class can't even use...<p>: He probably had another hour to go before that spawn finally did come... folllowed by perhaps 20 seconds of fighting...<p>: I am getting SO FED UP with this constant camping for stuff!<p>: <br>: Pirmin<p>
