Int is enough to max all skills by the 2nd bub of exp in a new level ( assuming they are worked evenly) and Charisma although important early on to make the most coin and to establish faction in some quest/city area , it can be overcome but smart playing (killing the right mobs to balance the faction issue)<br>There is much more to say on this topic but the New Quests call me into Norrath...If you wanted a more detailed view just send me a tell in game and we can arrange something.
