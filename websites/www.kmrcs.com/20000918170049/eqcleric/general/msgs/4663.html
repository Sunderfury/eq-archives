: : You are healers!!!  A crusader is called a paladin!!

: Paladin's are called paladins....Healers who go berserk and kill things in the name of thier god.  Well I call them crusaders.  Clerics CAN solo.  Easily solo undead. And solo live stuff with some difficulty.  Only thing is after they win they half half the down time a warrior has.

: : Why, cause they can melee.... clerics can not.. end of story

: Clerics CAN melee for half the game. The rangers next to me at lvl 21 hit for about the same amount of melee.  Actually maybe less since even before I cast any spells the mob turns around to hit me. All depends on the weapon they hold. I am happy to have it turn on me...I have more HP and AC then they do anyway. It means less healing.

: It is not too uncommon for me to melee a blue without magic at lvl 21. Athough sometimes I will cast root and use 2 bubs of mana to heal myself to full near the end.

: At lvl 21 I solo aviaks and elephants (full size) easily (but some are green) without using mana.  While my warrior friend said...no you don't...yep a little 21 halfling cleric killing something 50x his size solo.

: I do have to use all my mana on a white these days....

: I used to solo blues 2 at a time....sometimes 10 in a row....before resting for 2 mins. Which is why I reached lvl 20 in less then 5 days played time SOLO without my friends hanging around to lvl me.

: : Crusaders??  try that solo
