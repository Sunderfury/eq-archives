armors for you. Verant has made it a point to NEVER give out hints when people complain about not getting this or cant wear that (well cept that one time about the medium bronze in Permafrost).

As I uncross <br>: my eyes, I notice Dwarves can!  Gah.  <p>: In fact 3 specific cleric races are left out.  DE, gnomes and halflings.  Since <br>: size isn't a factor, dwarves not being medium size, what is the qualifying <br>: criteria for a fancy piece of armor that provides wisdom to the naturally unwise <br>: and mana-retentiveless gnomes like myself?<p>
