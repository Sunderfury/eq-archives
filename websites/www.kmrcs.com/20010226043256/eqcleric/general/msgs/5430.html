Tried doing one of the quests, to obtain one of the pieces of the new cleric armor.  Got the information for the reverent valor piece of the armor.  You run down to the Rathe mountaints, and talk to Lianna, who is in the gypse camp(not too far away from the rathe lake zone).  I asked her  "What happen to Regis?", and her reply was that Regis was kill in North Karanna,  close to the northern treeline to the east, and was slained by Zahal the slayer.   When you kill Zahal Regis' body is suppose to come up, where he died at, and should have Lianna's flute on it.  You are suppose to get the Flute and take it back to Lianna, and I think she will give you the icon and ingot for the reverent.  Which with those two pieces and three enchanted platium bars you trade in for a piece of the cleric armor.<p>My problem is I, nor anyone I talked on in the North karanna zone, has ever seen Zahal. (I had a few 30ish Rangers try to track him for me with no luck)  I do not know when or where he spawns, nor what level he is.   Any info to this clue will be most helpful to myself, and fellow brothers of the cloth :)<p>Thanks,<br>Daladur
