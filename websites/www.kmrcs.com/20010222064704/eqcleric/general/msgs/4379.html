I asked several guides and GMs on the Tarew Marr server last night that said it was technically impossible to do.  Don't know if this is REALLY true.  I'm trying to get an answer from tech support today, so I'll post the answer later on.<p>They do sometimes bump players up in levels, but this hasn't been done in awhile.  I did find out that they may be doing this soon, as the Paineel, The Hole, Plane of Hate & Plane of Air are all being worked on.  They will definately need more clerics.  Just to take a look at it last night, I signed on and did a /who all cleric 30 50....  Only 3, all level 30-32.  The other character I told myself I would start next would be an enchanter (wanted to be sought after for gruoping, but not go thruogh the cleric hell years), so I looked at those next- 4 above 40 (2 of them 50).  Either the clerics are anon (which no other class seems to do) or there are VERY few of them.<p>The thought of going through all those early levels, knowing the end result, just seems so painful again.<p>
