Man im getting tired of all the crying DEs. Suck it up and continue on (like the DE clerics i know).<br>You are crying for class AND race specific quest/armor/weapons. Hmm..list all the dwarven race AND class specific quest/armor/items for clerics. <br>*waiting*. Get off the BB hammer already it is a unique GM quest item. Do you know all the unique GM quest items that are avaliable?  No you dont. I guess when the GM hands out a unique barbarian-only frost sword, or a dark elf-only wizard staff we can expect to hear crying from the "cheated" races as well eh?<br>A DE cleric now can obtain EVERYTHING i am wearing/wielding at 47th level (and i think im pretty well equiped). So thats not good enough for you? You think you deserve something better?...BAH!.<br>Quest are lame, both item and exps wise. Guess how many this dwarven cleric has done?...ZERO!. Why?  Because by the time i was high enough to do the quest i already had a better item obtained by just standard adventuring.<br>If you are playing Everquest to quest then you are in for a rude awakening. <br>The one point i can agree on is the DE mask. I think there should be a "good" race mask somewhere out there. But who says there isnt? Just because no ones found one doesnt mean its not out there.<p>: Ok, listen...<p>: It's obvious that dwarves are the only race they think about when adding new equipment. It's not an coincident that they forgot about dark elves when they made that new armor or added this new weapon.<p>: They just don't think of the whole situation the dark elf clerics are in... Yes, we know, that was a typo bla bla bla. But this happened all the same time as they finally added a weapon which clerics can use to the game and made so that most races but the dark elves...<p>: The whole picture here is like this, as a dark elf cleric<p>: - we can not do cleric quests (bullsmasher for example)<br>: - we can not use cleric equipment (butcherblock hammer for example)<br>: - we can not alter faction by using a mask, like all other clerics can to come to our city (which could help them in their quests in our city, if we had any quests that is *smiles*)<p>: ...And now they "forgot" about us when making new cleric armor??? well excuse me but it seems like they totally forgot that there even ARE dark elf clerics in their game.........<p>: /Patz<p>
