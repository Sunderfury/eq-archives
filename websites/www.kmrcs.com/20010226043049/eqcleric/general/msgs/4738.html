1.   I love Clerics. If anything, they are THE most crucial part of a smooth adventure (even if we don't get a variety of items suited to our class)<p>2.   I only ressurect ppl when it's not really inconvenient. I'll go a bit out of my way, but not so much that I myself miss out on adventuring. I also always tell them it will cost 20 plat. I don't always take it tho, depends on who and how it's asked.<p>3.   A cleric's responsibility is EXACTLY the same as ANY OTHER CLASS. And that responsibility is to TO HIS OWN PARTY ONLY. Period. This isn't an opinion, its an absolute undisputable fact that I dont mind telling people. If anyone thinks otherwise, I'll put them on a permanant ignore list because they obviously are retarded or so stupid as to make them seem as such.<br>I don't think I need to go into any examples as to why this is true.<p>4.   I genuinely love to help people. And to get the most enjoyment out of this class, you have to feel the same way. And I don't just help with Res's: I help with advice, I help with excitement, I help with positive thinking, I help with encouragement. All of these things come from the heart - not from the game, and both the adults and kids who play realize this even if they don't know they do.<p>5.   I AM my character. Ebay will never get a shot at it. Once you go that route, your soul is sold and you might as well quit playing altogether because you'll never truely enjoy the game again.<p>Think about it...<p>Thanks for reading.<p>Psomm, the Mentalist...<br>
