: I've used Resescitate on myself, after loosing close to a full bub of exp at 42.  It moved my exp bar from about 4/5 of the way to the thrid bub to just under the second bub.  When I res'd myself I had just barely over the second bub, so unless the 39 spell is supposed to do about 10% (I thought it was around 38%), then it was variable.  I also recast it once I had the mana, and I got some more experience back.  Not too sure if THAT was supposed to happen either.<p>
