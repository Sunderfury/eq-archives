Your post is confusing to me.  I have a cleric as my main character (currently level 23) and a barb warrior as a 2nd character to let my friends catch up a bit, and yes it is true a warrior spends a lot of time sitting if he isn't in a group with a cleric, but the downtime isn't that bad unless you are trying to fight stuff that is above your level.  I just hit 16 last night and I can fight 4-5 different blue criters before I really have to sit down and rest - granted I have dual wield & double attack and have a Polished Granite Tomahawk (effect of beserker str) as one of my weapons so that helps a lot, but it's no different than other stuff.  You just have to realize that there is a disadvantage of playing each class.<p><p><br>: If you want to get bored, try developing a Warrior character, just to see what the other side is like. I did this and thought it would be fun at he raised to lvl 15 and got dual wield and double hit abilities. However, I found out very quickly that it was really boring to sit and heal yourself at a warrior as you levels increase and the amount of hp you have does. Cleric heal up 3-5 time faster with med and use of spells. I found I was better able to solo melee with my cleric than an equal level warrior, since I could also cast furor in between hits and heal up much faster so I could kill the next mob. Hope this helps you. You never know how good you have it sometimes til you see the other side. Without clerics, a warrior spends all his time trying to heal slowly.<p>: Karaf<br>: 19th Order Dwarf Cleric<p>
