I agree 100% with what has been said.

No weapon.  I had Healing and LH, Stun, Holy Might, Root, Blinding Flash or Cancel Magic (depending on upcoming MOB), Smite and DA memorized.  It worked great!<p>Only once did we have to run, and that was when both of our roots were resisted twice, and my smite only did 4 damage (wee!), and the gob ran off and grabbed 4 more friends after we just killed a train of 5, with one red to the 20 SK.<p>If the two cleric had meleed and burned, we would not have killed 3 of them total, and would have died.  Also, by staying outside of the fight, you can see if more 'friends' come into the fight.  The tanks don't always notice that 2 more are beating on them when 3 already are.<p>One more tip for the night.  When you know you are going up against casters that can heal, make sure that you have 2 stuns memorized.  When you see that blue come out of their hands, stun them!  Nothing is worse than seeing a MOB get off a G Heal in a huge melee.

: I agree 100% with what has been said.  I am currently just a few kills away from lvl 20 (must resist urge to solo in Permafrost!) and have been fighting in Permafrost for the last level or 2.

: Our main group consists of a lvl 20 Ogre SK, lvl 18 Bard (don't leave home without one!) and 2 clerics.

: Being a HE Cleric, I can't lift my own arms, so tonight I went in with a Skull of J'Hentra and a Chiton Shield.  No weapon.  I had Healing and LH, Stun, Holy Might, Root, Blinding Flash or Cancel Magic (depending on upcoming MOB), Smite and DA memorized.  It worked great!

: Only once did we have to run, and that was when both of our roots were resisted twice, and my smite only did 4 damage (wee!), and the gob ran off and grabbed 4 more friends after we just killed a train of 5, with one red to the 20 SK.

: If the two cleric had meleed and burned, we would not have killed 3 of them total, and would have died.  Also, by staying outside of the fight, you can see if more 'friends' come into the fight.  The tanks don't always notice that 2 more are beating on them when 3 already are.

: One more tip for the night.  When you know you are going up against casters that can heal, make sure that you have 2 stuns memorized.  When you see that blue come out of their hands, stun them!  Nothing is worse than seeing a MOB get off a G Heal in a huge melee.
