: I think you're jumping the gun.

: A number of the items are &quot;ground spawn&quot;, and like the ice comet rods, will probably appear every 5 minutes or so.

: Lets wait and see just how things go before you damn Verant. Want did you want? Cleric armor that was easy to get? Bought from a vendor?

: Yes, Aviak Charms for Crafted Armor got farmed heavily, but thats only because Aviaks were being camped anyway. Sol A is almost always empty, even though you need a fire totem for the crafted helm. And crafted isn't even No Drop.

: No one other than a cleric is going to be farming these items. You won't see our armor for sale on ebay, auctions for 100s of plat, or for &quot;trade only&quot;.

: I think this is a good thing, lets at least give it a chance.
