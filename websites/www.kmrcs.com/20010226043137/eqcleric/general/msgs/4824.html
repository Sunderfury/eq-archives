: Intresting that you quit your cleric just as it starts to become more specialised in healing, when the real differances bettwean druids/shamans and cleric's start to become increasinly apparant.

: I don't know what level your other charicter is but I'm assuming you havn't hunted in places such as lower Guk or Sol B much, were your party is being chalanged.

: At lower levels, while a cleric can be a very usefull addition to a party, they are not essential, no class is.

: At higher levels it is simply not efficent to not have a cleric, as mobs hit in the hundrads and wizards can reduce DD for 1000's in a very short time. In some cases it is just not possible to hunt a paticular area without a cleric.

: For lower level clerics (particuly those having problems at the moment) ignore this post. As a cleric I can walk into groups in a fraction of the time it takes other classes to get a group (including druids & shamans).

: Clerics start off slow and have can have some very hard levels (I didnt rearly have a problem but some people do), but it does get better and keeps getting better.

: What is rearly a waste is a cleric that gett's to 34 and then quits just before class starts to rearly shine, rather than being just enouther good addition to a party.

: Hinur
: best dressed cleric on Cazic ;)

: : Well that is where you are wrong I have played the cleric class and know from experience I got my cleric to lvl 34 and like I have said res is the only good thing the cleric class has I have played basically all the classes and races so far and honestly the cleric was the biggest waste of time if you like the class fine but you must live a boring life yes a boring life and must feel useless with no purpose in the world of Norath other than leaching off of other peoples experience. Someday you too will realize the hours on end you have wasted with this char basically you will strip him and start a new twinkie . To this you may not admit publicly but will to your self that Blackeye was right and you where wrong face the facts you a just a leach stuck on a partys back in the world of everquest.
