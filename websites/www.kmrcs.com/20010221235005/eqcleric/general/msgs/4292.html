  Despite what some other high level clerics will tell you, your job isn't ONLY to buff/med/heal all the time. If you're doing this then you're losing out on playing this class truly effectively.  I have found that using the stun line of spells in groups with a lot of tanks helps limit the amount of dmg done to your group members.  Many clerics use these stun spells to debilitate casters and even to help take down giants by stunning them constantly in order to let the warriors take em down.<br>  I also use fear on the enemy to ensure a quick getaway as well though that doesn't pertain as much to the subject at hand.<br>  The bottom line is that you should do what you feel most comfortable with and should remind these warriors that you're not there to fight side by side with them in melee, but to keep their arses from taking dirt naps in dangerous areas.  If they can't understand that, there are more than enough other groups that will take you for JUST your healing ability if that's the way you like it.<p><br>"Behind every great warrior there is an excellent cleric."  -Twigg Bramblefoot<p>
