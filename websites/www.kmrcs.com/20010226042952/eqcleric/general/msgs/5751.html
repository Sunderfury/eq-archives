she is on that island. spawn time i dont know, but when you first get on the island take a left down that first passage then a right and the split and thats where she spawn.  you have to keep the area clear of the other necro's, if not they will heal her up and you will have a hard time killing her. the first time i went we saw her and she had alot of other necro's standing around all with pets.  well me and my 26 wizard friend both nuked her with everything (im 35). well i hit her with wrath 2 times and he hit her with whatever his spell is and by the time the necro's were done doing dark empathy on her, she was full life again and next thing we know we are both dead.  the next time i went, i took my guildmates with me and we had no problem when she spawned.  i know i didnt answer your question about the spawn time but figured you would like a little info on her.<p>Gallanorf<br>35 cleric E'CI
