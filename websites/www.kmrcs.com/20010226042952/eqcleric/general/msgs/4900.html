Blackeye obviously didn't get enough attention as a child...so I usually ignore his pleas for negative attention.  But lately I have noticed that there seems to be some kind of cleric backlash on this board.  It seems to come from the melee classes and seems to be a very small and noisy minority. Now I see some of our younger clerics starting to waver in their decision to play this class.  I doubt it's anything to be alarmed about, but since I love a good argument, and I'm kind of bored at the moment, I'd like to clear up what I feel are some serious misconceptions:<p><b>1) Clerics are a useless class after 34th: </b><p>Hahah...this one is so preposterous that it almost doesn't dignify a response.  If you're going to do the serious dungeons you don't have a prayer without at least one cleric.  And it's not just because of the Revive line of spells.  Greater Heal is pretty much useless when you're fighting groups of mobs that double hit for 119 and kick for 75.  It's only use is to help heal between fights after 35th level.  If you don't believe me, check out the druid and shaman message boards and listen to them complain how they're not viable healers after 35th.  The only way a player is going to get past level 40 without some cleric friends is by kiting guards and we all know how fun and exciting that is.  Oh, and the loot, what fabulous loot Guard Jacsen drops.  Just can't be beat. Perhaps this is why some people feel such strong anti-cleric sentiment, because we're the one class in the game that high level parties can't do without in high level dungeons.  I'll give the 3 reasons why they can't do without us: Superior Healing, Complete Healing, Resurrection.  Atone and stun are just icing on the cake.<p><b>2) Clerics are useless prior to 34th: </b><p>I've met some really useless clerics prior to 34th...seriously useless clerics.  But a smart cleric can contribute as much to a group as a shaman or druid if they are played intelligently.  If you're in Unrest people will take you over a shaman or druid even if the shaman/druid paid to be in the group.  Outside of Unrest a well played cleric be just as valuable to a group as a druid or shaman.  Not sure how?  Why don't I explain as I debunk some of the myths about us:<p><i> Clerics Can't Nuke </i><p>It's not our specialty by any means but we can lay out some damage when the occasion calls for it.  Smite is almost as good as Careless Lightning when it comes to damage to mana ratio (70/83 vs 70/99).  It sure beats any DD spell shaman get before 24th in a major way.  The druid has a better casting time so they can chain cast, but if more firepower is what your group needs, why not just get a wizard?  Shaman have a DD advantage over us from 24th-28th level but we have Greater Healing at that level.  Once level 29 comes we get Wrath and they get Greater Healing.  The sum of the results?  We get better DD and Healing than the Shaman.  We Get better Healing and comparable DD to druids.  Plus 30th level is when fire based DD really starts to suck.  For some reason, high level mobs have very high FR.  So Wrath starts to become better than Combust at around 30th level.  Don't believe me?  Go check out the druid boards and ask why many druids continue using Careless Lightning into the forties.<p><i> Clerics can't DoT </i><p>Nope we sure can't.  And you know what?  Most groups really don't seem to care.  In fact, many groups are glad that Clerics can't DoT because it keeps the less intelligent and stubborn types from wasting their mana on DoTs.  DoTs can be great in group combat if you are heavy on healers and tanks and have no burners.  So a group of 3 Tanks, 1 Shaman, 1 Cleric and 1 Enchanter could really make good use of dots.  But add 1 or 2 Wizards or Magicians to the group, or a Druid who likes to nuke and DoTs become a very bad use of mana.  DoTs are great for kiting but not so hot when it comes to group work.<p><i> Clerics Can't Melee </i><p>No argument here.  I hear all the arguments on this board about being a battle cleric.  If it makes you feel more important, kudos.  My time is better spent doing what I do best.  Druids and Shaman melee is just as worthless after 20th.  If you recruit a Shaman to melee for you, it shows how little you know about the game.<p><i> Now that I've cleared up some misconceptions, let me tell you what a cleric can do that a druid or shaman can't: Stun. </i><p>The stun line of spells is greatly underutilized and is one of the greatest weapons in the cleric's reportoire.  Stun will save the group more mana than any other spell when fighting nasty casting mobs.  Take the Festering Hag for instance.  She comes out dealing Frost Shocks to some unfortunate group member doing 180 damage a pop.  What can a Druid or Shaman do in this situation?  They can try to nuke the Hag and watch the puller and probably another group member die before they finally bring it down.  Or they can heal the puller as fast as they can and watch his life bar quickly drop as they try to keep up with her nasty damage.  They'll use all their mana and have the tank finish the fight at 1 bubble of health and then have to sit and med another 5 minutes to heal him back to full health.  Then they get to med an additional 5 minutes to get mana back for the next pull.<p>Now let's see what a cleric can do.  The Hag comes running out and begins to cast Frost Shock.  Cleric casts Stun.  Hag's spell is interrupted and group gets 2-3 seconds to unload without any counterattack.  Hag begins casting again.  Cleric casts Holy Might.  Hag's spell is interrupted and group gets 4-6 seconds to unload without any counterattack.  Hag begins to cast again.  Cleric casts Stun.  And by this point the Hag is usually dead (sooner if you have a wizard or two in your group).  The tank is probably at 3 or 4 bubbles of health (hag usually gets one or two casts off while chasing him out of the house). And the cleric is at 3.5 to 4 bubbles of mana.  Top off the tank and you're at 2.5 bubbles of mana.  Med for 3 minutes and you're ready to go again.  Now you tell me which scenario is better.<p>Or let's take a Lizard Justiciary in Cazic Thule.  This mob double hits for 70, has loads of hit points and has the mana to heal itself completely three times.  And like all healing mobs, it can almost always get its heal off even if the tanks hit it 8 times in the process.  Watch a group with 2 druids or a druid and 1 wizard try to take it down.  The Justiciary will absorb all of their mana and half the tanks health before going down.  Now remove a druid or shaman and insert a cleric in there.  Wizard and warrior get the Justiciary down to 1/4 life.  Justiciary begins to heal.  1 Cast of Holy Might and the heal is interrupted.  The wizard and warrior now have 4 or 5 seconds to finish it off.  If that's not enough use Stun to interrupt the next heal attempt and they'll finish that annoying lizard off for certain.<p>Then you have atone.  No enchanter available for crowd control?  Atone is the next best thing.  Atone saves a lot of mana and lives if used correctly.  Certainly more mana and lives than Poison Storm.  Why waste mana on that green trash mob running for reinforcements when a simple cast of Atone will rectify the situation?<p>So tell me again how clerics are useless before 34th?<p><b>3) And then there's the PvP issue </b> <p>I play a cleric on the pvp server and I've demonstrated to many a philistine just how godly they are in a pvp situation.  I can take down any caster in the game, wisdom or int based.  After 29th it becomes laughably easy.  Few believe this fact until they actually duel me.  I rarely get asked for a rematch.<p>Before the ultra nerf patch, I could take warriors down.  Now I just don't have the mana to do it.  That used to bother me but then I just realize that a tank has no way of killing me and I'm reassured.  But I still have the mana to take down a monk and rogue of the same level. <p><b>4) To Sum Up </b><p>People who think Clerics are boring just don't understand a Cleric's subtleties.  I played a druid to the high 30's and now I play a cleric.  Clerics are a more powerful class in my opinion.  Druids are a blast to play, but they find their roles to be less and less glamorous and necessary as they rise in level.  Shaman also find themselves playing a dimished role in groups once they hit the high 30's.  So even though verant keeps nerfing us, it pays in the long run to play a cleric.<p>Regards,<p>Jonny
