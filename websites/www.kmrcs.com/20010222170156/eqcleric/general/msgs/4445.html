: True, you should have different quests, perhaps from &quot;The Hole&quot; or &quot;Paineel&quot;?

: : Highpass- KOS
: : Everfrost-Play tag with guards

: The river and broken ice in Everfrost is quite a safe distance from ANY of the guards there. No &quot;tag&quot; necessary unless you're wandering around lost.

: : Kerra Isle-KOS in Qeynos and Erudin

: Have someone invis you and go get on the boat. Don't have to go to Erudin at all.

: : The situation is even worse for Roleplayers (EQ is supposed to be an RPG?),which is why im KOS in Highpass and qeynos.Ill Kill no xp Guards because it fits my role.

: Everquest is a MMORPG and the vast majority of players are not &quot;evil&quot; so they receive proportionately less attention from Verant (have to keep customers happy). If despite that you purposely give yourself bad faction by killing green creatures only because it &quot;fits your role&quot; then please don't complain about what damage that bad faction causes you. You cutting your own throat on that one.
