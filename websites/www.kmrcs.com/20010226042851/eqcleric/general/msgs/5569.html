Well here i am bitching about the quests :) <br>Now i for one love the new quests except for two things<br>(1) Re-spawn time is insane <br>(2) From what i have seen, from message boards, pictures and so on. Cleric armor is the only one none drop. I have seen pic of are boots and hands and there Magic Lore None-Drop. But shaman, ranger, warrior, SK, Necro, Wiz, Enchanter, Bard Rogue armor is all Magic Lore, seen none on pallies yet. So do we get screwed over with none drop. I really hope not. I chatted with 2 GM's today and they said the new patch changed the armor to Lore so we will be able to buy it. I would really like to beleive them but i want some feed back from people that get these items or if i get them i will respond to it. Well thats my rant for the day any comments are welcome.
