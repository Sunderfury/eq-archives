I did this again, and I was attacked again...<p>(1) I bound myself in front of the house and then ran to Rivervale and get the jum. Used Gate and ran back to Qeynos to get the potion. Used Gate again to give it to him.<br>(2) It was around 11am when I gave it to him.<br>(3) He was inside the house sitting.<p>Daylight hours, him being in his house, and minimal time taken to do the quest, and I'm still attacked. What's wrong??
