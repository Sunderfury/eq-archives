I've not heard any specifics,, other than the general area where some of the icon/ingots should be.  AND, were forced to employ an enchanter to enchant bars of platinum. <p>6 Hours, eh?  I hope not.<p>However, I was grouping w/ my son (we have 2 accounts) as Trolls, a while back.  Last time we were in Grobb, I spotted one of these little bags, in the water near the bar.  Of course, I picked it up.  It was "An Old Silver Coin", No Drop, Lore Item.   For a couple of minutes, my son & I examined it,, wondered what it was for, & soon there was another right in its place.  Definately less than 5 minutes. <p>After searching AllaKhazam's for what this item might be, it turns out that it's used in an Enchanter spell quest for thier 49th level spell, Tashania.  What does this have to do with our Cleric Armor quest?  I'm getting to it, hold on...<p>My point is, if these "Old Silver Coins" respawned so quickly, I can't imagine they'd completely hose clerics by forcing them to digest a terminally slow spawn of 6 hours.  Especially when you consider, this armor is destined to become commonplace.  Where as Tashania, is only usable by 49L Enchanters.  I would think, there's going to be a much larger demand for this cleric armor.<p>Lets all be very good, about posting new items, & thier stats here...
