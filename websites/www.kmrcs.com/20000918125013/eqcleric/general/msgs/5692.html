K now if anyone could tell me or convince me WHY i should do these quests? See my view of this WHOLE new quest zone was to get quest to get items that can benifit are class, well you like to think so anyways and what can help us out as clerics? Mana or Wis enhancments and from what i have seen there is not ONE piece of armor yet that has wis. WTF does a cleric need +5 ing greaves or that crappy Bplate. I decide after i get my full gear of Fear wear hopefully soon and have nothing to do i will camp the quest armor just to increase my stash. As a cleric if there was one piece of armor that should had been Wis or mana was the bplate. Like i said before Vernant got an A+ for effort but man WTF are they thinking? Guess they feel we are to powerful as it is, oh well thats my rant for today. Any follow up be appricated<p>
