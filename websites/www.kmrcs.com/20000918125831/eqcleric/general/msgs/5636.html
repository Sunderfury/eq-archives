 Well we all know that rubicite was taken out of the game. I am level 41 and have NEVER had a peice. Now i finally got a peice of the new cleric armor.<p>Well its the boots. 9 ac and +6 vs disease (a rather cruddy waste of cash but it looks cool). So im sporting my new boots now over my steel. Well i take a look at some of the other sites and notice that shamans armor is better than ours!!!! Are we not the ones who are supposed to be wearing the better armor. Not to downgrade shamans but this is just not right.<p>And melee classes have bonuses on their armor that we as clerics would just die for. rangers have +wis on their breast and not a single +wis item for clerics has been disclosed to the public yet.<p>Next on my list of peeves is the rare spawn in dagnor's cauldron who holds the ingot of consant. Due to verant @#%!$@ idea to place a +5 wis belt on this mob it is hunted and killed even when there are no clerics in the zone. Guess what happens to the ingot then. ITs thrown away and a cleric has to wait another 7 hours for the mob to spawn. This game is turning into evercamp.<p>Oh and did i mention this armor provides a lesser ac than rubicite]<p>Oberan Lifebringer<br>41st level high priest of Innoruuk<br>Rallos Zek<br>

:  Well we all know that rubicite was taken out of the game. I am level 41 and have NEVER had a peice. Now i finally got a peice of the new cleric armor.

: Well its the boots. 9 ac and +6 vs disease (a rather cruddy waste of cash but it looks cool). So im sporting my new boots now over my steel. Well i take a look at some of the other sites and notice that shamans armor is better than ours!!!! Are we not the ones who are supposed to be wearing the better armor. Not to downgrade shamans but this is just not right.

: And melee classes have bonuses on their armor that we as clerics would just die for. rangers have +wis on their breast and not a single +wis item for clerics has been disclosed to the public yet.

: Next on my list of peeves is the rare spawn in dagnor's cauldron who holds the ingot of consant. Due to verant @#%!$@ idea to place a +5 wis belt on this mob it is hunted and killed even when there are no clerics in the zone. Guess what happens to the ingot then.
