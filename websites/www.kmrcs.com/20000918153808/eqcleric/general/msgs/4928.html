: Last night we kill Greater Kobolds in Sol B.  In the team we just 3, same level paladin cleric druid.  Our druid starting to fade from the role &quot;2nd healer&quot; and rock.

: First off he cast a demage shield to the Pal to pull.  When puller back,  druid cast a Dot on GK, regen on paladin.  Then we just sit back and watch.  Our polly is so happy that he can finish the GK himself with ds, dot and regen.  The hp bar of GK drop much quicker then the tank.  It is quite amazing at such level since the mob is same level as the tank.
