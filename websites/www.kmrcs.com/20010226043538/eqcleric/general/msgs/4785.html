May have been a fluke.  I never had a problem other<br>than too many weakling mummy's or zombies are what<br>I find.  Keep trying for a bit...<p>Walterscott<br>: I had been told that I should stay near the northern zone boundary, just use find undead and nuke away.  I cannot find any undead at all within a 3 minute run from the border.  Is this a good spot only at night, or am I doing something wrong?<p>
