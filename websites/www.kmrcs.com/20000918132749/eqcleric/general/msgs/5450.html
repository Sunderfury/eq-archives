Okay, so i made a minor mistake when specialization came out. I had tons of practice points so i trained in all the specializations on the first day (before they had names). Well Evocation hit 50 first and thats what ive had ever since. Now at the new zone i can "forget" all my specialization by giving this guy a ruby.<br>Well if youve noticed specialization does not move up very fast. My skill level in specialization is 177. I must say that i like being specialized in it. Many will cry that being a cleric its complete stupid not to specialize in Abjuration. But when grouping with other clerics who are i see very little difference in mana depletion when we are just healing. <br>I would love to do a real comparison on specialization and the effect it has on mana usage. Are there any clerics out there that are 48th level and know what their skill level in Abjuration specialization  that would like to help? <br>First we would need to get at the same wisdom. Im at 189. Then we would each need to load up healing (abjuration) spells of various levels. Start be casting Complete heals. Then switch from superiors, greaters, then regualars. If you get any fizzles you will have to wait till full mana and start over. Keep an accurate count of the type and number of each heal you use and then we can figure up total mana. <br>Tonight i will drop my wisdom to 180 and do this experiment. Then i will post the results here.<br>
