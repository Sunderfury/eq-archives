I only want to say that a 300 point heal is not always going to be better than a 300pt DD. A simple example is a hag in unrest. If you dont take them down quickly they have the potential to do a huge amount of damage to one person or even the entire party. A DD spell thrown in with your tanks slashing on the hag could save you quite a bit of mana in healing. Ive seen hags cast that AoE spells consistently several times in a battle or just the simple Force shock 2 or 3 times on someone. Add that up. It equals Death for most people if they dont resist. If not death it sure is more than ONE "300" point heal. Its simple to generalize and say that you should heal and not use DD, but theres too many situations that DD is a good option to reduce the amount of healing your gonna need. Besides, if you manage your mana correctly, your not gonna sit there and blast non stop.. When Im the only healer I only DD once maybe twice.. depending.. when theres another healer I have a little more flex..<p>Most of the areas you said about the petition I agree with. <p>: I really thought our petition went in the wrong direction in a number of areas.  I posted before the petition was sent that the 'stun' aspect of DA was to prevent it from being a complete 'get out of jail' card.  I think GZ had a similar view.<p>: Issues I really thought need addressing;<p>: The Holy Armor line is inefficient and compares very poorly to the valor line.<br>: Spell delays on some spells are very strange, what's up with the 10 second delay on Resist Magic?<br>: Revive line has really been nerfed yet it still cost a bundle to cast.<br>: I think we should get regen but I saw the reasoning on not giving it.<br>: Group buff spells.<p>: I only disagree with you on the Undead spells for one reason.  There are very few good clerics, many clerics like to make the most of their damage capabilities and fail to focus on why ever group wants them.   On a whole, the cleric players are getting better as the servers mature but it seems to take them awhile to learn that a 300 point heal will cause more damage to the MOB than a 300 point DD spell.<p>
