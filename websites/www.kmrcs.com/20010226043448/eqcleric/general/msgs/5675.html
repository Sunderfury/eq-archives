: How is a DE Cleric suppose t oget around? What I know.. he is pretty much KoS everywhere he goes! That means being trapped in. How can I avoid being KoS in Rivervale, Freeport, and the other places around my hometown? Don't give me the answer go kill stuff for faction because I have no time for that. Ohh yeah.. where should I fight atlvl 10+ (wish he had a cleric guide link :o)<p>Im a 37th level DE and have had no problems finding hunting grounds...E. Commons and N. Ro till level 12.... then off to Lava Storm to level 16.... After 16 go to High Hold, you will have to work on faction with the orcs at the zone, but one night of that and you will have no problem in town.
