: Deep dungeon parties require several groups.

: Imagine a bard in each and an enchanter in every other group alternated with a shaman(since you can't mez dragons or Fire giants and such all the enc needs to do is clarity and alacrity). Add a cleric and shaman in each group and you are kicking some butt...especially if the tanks have FBSS.

: Why? Bards speed attack and afterwards mana and health songs.

: Stacks with Haste effects on executiones axe, flowing black silk sash etc...

: Stacks with enchanters celerity and clarity

: Stacks with shaman quickness for some odd reason (or so said a recent post I read).

: So 2 warriors with 4 speed effects on them and good buffs backed by a cleric, wizard, bard, and either shaman or enchanter. Imagine the dmg those warriors would put out!!!

: That would truly be an awsome sight.... Each warrior would have to be hitting maybe 3x speed. On top of the buffs STR, AGI, DEX, STA, center, holy armor buffs.

: Give the pets the same buffs and 2 FS daggers with a 19 delay....
