: Ideal Group:

: 1 Cleric
: 1 Warrior
: 1 Wizard
: 1 Bard
: 1 Ranger
: 1 Shaman

: Cleric: reasons are obvious to everyone who frequents this board.

: Warrior:  There is no better tank or can dish out melee hurt like a Warrior.  Warriors may have a hard time soloing due to their lack of versatility, but in a well balanced group, they do what they do BEST.

: Wizard:  DD and Evac.  any questions?

: Bard:  I had a hard time choosing between a bard or enchanter for this spot.  Bard won in the end.  Why?  Manasong is faster mana regen than Clarity.  Skillfull bards may also &quot;stack&quot; multiple songs to produce simultaneous effects ie. manasong, healsong, etc....  Bards have the ability help tank when needed (if both warrior and ranger are occupied and a gob is beating on the cleric/wiz).  More versatility.

: Ranger:  Their ability to track EVERYTHING in the zone.  Pull, Tank, Snare, Sow.  

: Shaman:  one of the best DOT dishers in the game, offensive buffs, Chloroplast, Canabalize, additional healer in crisis.
