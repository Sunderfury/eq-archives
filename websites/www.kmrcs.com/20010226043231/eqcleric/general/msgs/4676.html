In Highpass hold I saw a group of 3 wizzies taking on a orc - the way they did it was the first wizzie blast at the orc - a sec after the orc turned toward the first wizzie, wizzie #2 blasted the orc with the same spell the first used, thereby angering the orc to turn toward it.  Then wizzie #3 repeated the step and turn on him.  After 1 more blast the orc was dead.  So it is possible if you have 3 wizzies that are organized and know what to do and how to do it, it would be possible to do - it would just take a bit of coordination.<p><p>: I had a very successful night in a very odd group.  We had 2 enchanters, 2 wizards, a monk, and me.  One tank? Yep!<p>: The tank would pull, everyone would nuke = lots of dead lizzies.  We would ping pong the lizzies back and forth between the wizzies and me (Wrathing like mad).  If we got too many, no problem! Assist on the monk and mez the others.  We were unbeatable!<p>: One thing I've noticed is that the PURE classes such as pure tanks (monk/warrior), pure casters (wizzies/enchanters/necros), and pure healers (clerics) can be very effective, if not more effective than several hybrids.  However, you have to have at least a few of each for the group to work.  Hybrids are great when you don't have enough pures or to round out the party (can't be those shaman buffs for example).<p>: The monk was telling me that he was with 5 casters in the Upper Throne Room in Cazic!  Several necros, wizzies, and enchanters, and him!  He kept himself healed with mend and feigning when necessary.  In fact, the monsters were usually too busy running around at each caster that blasted it to worry about beating on the tank.  If one caster got too hurt, the others would taunt with spells.  I was quite amazed that it worked at all.<p>: Anyone else have good experiences with strange groups like this?<p>: <br>: Akane Milak<br>: 35th Cleric of Erollis Marr<br>: Cazic-Thule<p>
