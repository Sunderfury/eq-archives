: There are several lines of spells that all come at the same lvl and use the same reagent.

: Enchanters rune series
: Cleric symbol series
: Wizard shield skin

: I think perhaps some of the other casters get the shield skin as well. Not sure.  But paladins do infact get the lower lvl symbol spells.

: Therefore I beleive it is important that many of the other classes realize that is not only costly via gems but also mana....

: The best tanks will have some gems to hand you. The decent enchanters and wizards will either hand you the gems (really the exact same ones are used) or in my case as enchanter I exchange buffs before the big pull =) You give me symbol for 200 more HP and I give you rune for a 300hp absorption.  So we really have a whole lot more HP =)

: Paladins should understand the cost at lvl 30+ just explain to them thiers costs 2-3gp yours costs 1pp.

: Sometimes I just rune everyone before a big pull.  UUsually I don't have the warning before a big pull or the party is too anxious and I hate to ask to wait.

: Point is it is NOT an all the time buff.  And if you feel rich it is still only for the main-tank/puller (and the enchanter, hehe)
