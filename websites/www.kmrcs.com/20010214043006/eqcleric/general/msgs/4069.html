: 1.)  Corpses:  Yes there were too many and something had to be done.<p>: 2.)  A 2 hr time limit is just not enough time to res someone in alot of cases.  The time it takes to organize people for a romp for a corpse retrieval can take a long time.<p>: If it had an 8 hr - 24hr time on it, I would have absolutely no problem with it.  It gave people an adequate time to get ressed.<p>It's amazing.  Up to this point we are in total<br>agreement....<p>: Now the reason for the protest:<p>: Verant is using a game mechanic to get rid of some of the lag but at the expense of the clerics most distinquishable spell in the game.  Call it what you will, in the process it is a nerfing of our ressurect line of spells.<p>Yes, it's a nerf.  No doubt.  Is it a nerf that<br>can't be lived with, just like EVERY OTHER nerf<br>they've thrown at us?  The hope is that they'll<br>listen to feedback after a lot of people complain<br>that it isn't enough time... but you're not giving<br>the situation a long enough time to build a head<br>of steam.  It's only been a few days.  There can't<br>possibly be a critical mass of people that were<br>directly affected by this change.  In two weeks,<br>when people are TIRED of not getting ressed in<br>time, THEN there will be a public outcry, and<br>Verant will take notice.  In the meantime, there<br>will be piles of bodies, and lag will remain high.<br>Verant will continue to ignore the bodies since<br>they've already fixed that issue.  Therefore, any<br>remaining bodies are the result of WILFUL defiance<br>of the changes enacted, and NOT within their<br>ability to change.  If they had the ability to<br>change this, camping, kill-stealing and half a<br>dozen much more important issues would have been<br>resolved by now.<p>: Now the reason for what I do in game with corpses:<p>: While this change was on the test shard we already voiced our views on it.  Verant didn't budge.  Now, if Verant sees the amount of corpses reduce they will figure they did there job and move on and forget about it.  Res is the only true spell in the game which makes Clerics unique.  And yes, this changed nerfs our ability to res.<p>Again, how long was this test period, and how<br>heavily populated are the test servers?  If I<br>recall, there was a notice around the 23rd that<br>the test server would see the res time limit.  I've<br>never been on the test server, but I can almost<br>quote verbatim a line from a post I saw about the<br>test server, where someone said that everyone<br>should log on there at least once because "it's<br>really interesting to be the ONLY person in all<br>of Freeport."  That speaks volumes to me on how<br>effective the test server is in determining what<br>a patch will really do in a production environment.<p>: Now, when Verant sees that corpse counts are not falling as well as the feedback which players leave them when they leave a corpse, maybe then they will re-address the issue.<p>Nope.  Will ignore it for a minimum period to<br>allow the hot-heads and reactionaries to cool off,<br>then look at how well the system is working.  At<br>that point, your token corpse gesture will mean<br>nothing to them, but all the feedback they've<br>gotten from players of all levels and classes,<br>across all the servers, will more than likely<br>hold more weight in their estimation.  Then,<br>after carefully reviewing everything, they will<br>reduce the time limit to one hour, and refuse<br>to budge on that issue ever again.  This is my<br>prediction... anyone want to bet on it?  =)<p>: If you don't give Verant a reason to address an issue, they will just not address it.<p>: I will continue to do what I do.  I will res people and ask them to leave a junk item on their corpse if they want to show support for it.  I also ask them to send feedback to Verant as to why they are leaving a naked corpse.<p>But intentionally contributing to lag will not<br>cause them to address the resurrect time limit.<br>It will cause them to take more drastic action,<br>like making ALL player corpses DISAPPEAR after<br>2 hours.  THEN where will we be?  This is because<br>in very few cases will these people you tell to <br>leave their corpse with a trash item be able to<br>effectively communicate your protest in the way<br>you intend.  There's no quality control in that<br>process.  Think about it... some of the people<br>that you're doing resses for aren't exactly the<br>kind of people that you want to be a spokesperson<br>for your cause, I'm sure.  As with anything, there<br>are sure to be wackos and nut-jobs that will say<br>the WRONG things in an inflammatory manner... those<br>will be ignored.  There will also be people that<br>don't follow through with the feedback, or post a <br>lame-duck protest message to Verant.  Verant isn't<br>watching you, and keeping tabs on your in-game<br>political agenda, so they don't know what it's all<br>about.  All they see is a bunch of people still<br>leaving corpses around.  The obvious response is<br>to take more drastic action to stop that.<p>As I said before, Verant's only interest is in<br>two things:<p>1) Stopping individual cases of abuse or harassment.<br>2) Maintaining a minimum level of customer <br>satisfaciton across the board (also referred to as<br>"game balance").<p>They have to do case 1, so they don't get slapped<br>with frivolous lawsuits.  They keep personal issues<br>like taunting and harassing other players effectively<br>to a minimum, because these are the most likely<br>to result in unfavorable reactions in the real<br>world... people suing for Verant/Sony allowing<br>their child to be exposed to objectionable content,<br>etc.  Also things that are tantamount to assault<br>or stalking (personal attacks and harassment... I<br>know of one player that has been banned for this<br>kind of hostility toward another player)... These<br>things get out to the public and shed a negative<br>light on the companies and the game.<p>Issues related to the second objective are totally<br>in the hands of the Verant programmers, which is<br>why a lot of complaining has been seemingly tossed<br>aside, and Verant says "trust us, we're 'balancing'<br>the game."  This kind of stuff keeps the masses<br>in check, and keeps the game in a state where most<br>(not all, you can't please everyone all the time)<br>people are satisfied and keep playing the game.<br>Typically, as long as enrollment is increasing,<br>they are happy.  If enrollment declines at any<br>point, or to a degree, if account activity drops<br>without people cancelling their accounts, they<br>would begin to wonder what is causing people to<br>leave or stop playing.  That's when they take a<br>look at the big picture, compile all the customer<br>feedback, and develop a solution.  Lately there<br>have been a lot of complaints about lag.  They<br>look and notice a lot of corpses.  A little<br>investigation and they determine that people are<br>abusing the Resurrect powers of the cleric by<br>leaving corpses lying around.  They take action,<br>NOT to nerf clerics, but to improve gameplay for<br>the OTHER 90-95% of the population...<p>OK, so it's the WRONG solution, but leaving corpses<br>is NOT the signal to them that you think it is.<br>It means that they didn't nerf it ENOUGH to make<br>an impact.  As a last resort, they might realize<br>that the extra corpses are actually a symbolic<br>protest and THEN consider changing the time limit.<br>Verant is so used to hearing a single sector of<br>the community complain each time a change is made.<br>Necros complain about pet nerfs.  Druids complain<br>about DoT nerf.  Rogues complain about having none<br>of the advertised skills, or they're broken if<br>they have them.  Clerics want better DD, faster<br>healing, better melee... You notice the trend yet?<br>Verant makes a change to one class that evens the<br>field a little bit.  In most cases its a tuning<br>down of some ability.  As a result, people complain.<br>As a result of the complaints, they don't (except<br>in a very FEW notable situations) reverse their<br>changes.. instead they selectively tune things<br>down somewhere else to level out another area.<p>For all the time that some people have spent playing<br>this game, it doesn't seem to me that they've<br>figured out that Verant is not in the business<br>of AUGMENTING any particular area of the game<br>except items and quests.  By reducing abilities,<br>and adding items and quests, they ensure that<br>people will play longer and pay more money.  If <br>the thought of quitting is even remotely in your<br>mind because of a nerf, some time shortly after,<br>you will be likely to see a small boon in the form<br>of a new item or quest.  You can learn to live <br>with some down-graded spell effects as long as<br>you have a shiny new whatchamacallit to go quest<br>after.  And while you're at it, here's another<br>$9.89 for another month.  That's what Verant is<br>counting on.<p>Your real problem isn't that they've nerfed this<br>spell, it's that we're all sheep that can't seem<br>to realize that Verant will do what they want<br>while we continue to pay them, and only our<br>money matters to them.  Are we going to quit?<br>Hell no.  But it doesn't rule out completely that<br>they do also rely on customer feedback for an<br>indication of how they're doing, in general.<br>Do they care if you leave corpses around?  Again,<br>not in the least, since they can effectively side-<br>step the issue.  "We enacted a change to fix that<br>problem, yet some people continue to intentionally<br>choose to defy that change.  There is nothing we<br>can do if you do not police yourselves."  They<br>will pass the buck back down to the gaming<br>community on this issue so that we pressure each<br>other not to do it, because by then it will be<br>obvious that Verant isn't going to do anything.<p>It's just the way companies work.  Companies worry<br>about the bottom line.  Consumers worry about<br>quality of service.  When the bottom line shows<br>that quality of service is low, the company will<br>take action.  Especially in a high-margin industry<br>like this... They probably spent a few tens of<br>millions on the development of this game, and<br>recouped almost of it in the first few months.<br>Now they have an operating expense for maintaining<br>the servers, which is fairly minimal, and a staff<br>of programmers and administrators to make changes<br>as needed.  For crying out loud, they've even got<br>VOLUNTEERS to take care of most of their customer<br>service issues.  All they do now is coast, fix only<br>the glaring problems, and rake in our cash.<p>I'd love to ramble on and on about this, but I'm<br>afraid it would only add to the lag associated<br>with this board... =)  But really, I doubt the<br>protest that you think is meaningful and effective<br>will prove to be either.  If it gets the time limit<br>raised to a reasonable level, I'll be glad, since<br>I'm sure you'll go ahead and do this anyway.  I<br>just don't have to sit idly by and endure the<br>effects of your actions without voicing my<br>concern.  If I pulled a train and got you killed<br>you'd have a few choice words for me, even though<br>I meant well when I tried to attack some mobs.<br>Well, you're doing something that potentially<br>impacts all of us, and I'm letting you know that<br>I don't particularly subscribe to your belief in<br>this protest, and I think there are more<br>constructive and/or less destructive ways of<br>conveying your message to Verant.<p>Gorgrim<br>Servant of Underfoot<br>Prelate of the 14th Cloth<br>Tarew Marr
