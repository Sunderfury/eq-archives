Maybe they do know about this.  i was told the servers were comming down again this morning for an update.  i went after these also.  went to guk(nobody was there) and got the first part.  then went with my friend that is lvl 26 wizard to go kill the necro (im a 35 cleric).  well she killed us both.  we both nuked her but all of the other necro's around healed her back up to full and she tore through us.  so a lvl 29 cleric went it to try it while i was running back.  he had to zone and when me and my wiz friend went back for payback, well she VANISHED.  i petitioned and they said "maybe she decided to go to a different plane"  what bs is that.
