Dear me, Blackeye, if you want to make a really stirring and dramatic flame effort, for heaven's sake, you're going to have to improve your atrocious spelling and grammar.  In addition, your current effort is almost wholly lacking in punctuation, which makes it very difficult to understand; and your syntax, oy vey!  <p>Really, old boy, any illiterate big-mouth with the IQ of mayonnaise and the sensitivity of linoleum can start a flame thread.  However, it takes real style to pull it off with panache.  <p>Next time, try using a dictionary, since misspelled insults lose much of their impact.  Also, stick in a comma or two.  Semicolons are perhaps beyond you, but you could try a period every now and then.  Exclamation points are also very useful for inflammatory text.  I might add that your use of the word "Faggot" is perhaps a little anachronistic; your use of "Red Cross," while meant to be derogatory, could be totally misconstrued in a positive light; and, lastly, your use of the word "Guy" is completely gender-specific (thereby allowing females to escape entirely from your insult!).  This just won't do!  A good insult should be as all-inclusive and as water-tight as possible.<p>If you attend to these stylistic defects, I'm sure that on your next effort, we will then be forced to take "illiterate" out of the equation.<p>Good luck!<br>Maaggie<br>of Xegony<p>: I have been recieving alot of mail concerning the comments that I have made saying that the cleric is a Faggot Red Cross Guy ....Now Just Becuase a A class is given a title .
