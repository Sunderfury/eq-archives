Having played a wizard into the high 20's & then abandoning it... AND now working Tomma to this point as well,  there is one VERY OBVIOUS difference between say,,Wizards Shieldskin, & a Clerics Symbol.<p>Wizards Shieldskin Series = A layer of magical skin, that absorbs dmg.  Once enough dmg has been dealt to the wizard, the skin drops.  In many fights, this can be just 2 or 3 hits from the mobs that a high 20s wizard would be fighting.  <p>Clerics Symbol Series = This is an actual BUFF, that increases the targets ACTUAL HP's.  It lasts as long as it's designed duration, & then drops.<p>So, wizards actually get shafted here. <p>I've started a new routine when joining a group, or adding a new member.  I give them my "SCHPEAL", hehe.  I explain to them that, while I am in touch w/ Mithaniel Marr, I am NOT clairvoyant.  If they need buffs, they need to speak up & say so.  I don't offer Symbol, unless it's a good friend,, OR if someone either asks & offers to pay or hands me gems.

: Wizards Shieldskin Series = A layer of magical skin, that absorbs dmg.  Once enough dmg has been dealt to the wizard, the skin drops.  In many fights, this can be just 2 or 3 hits from the mobs that a high 20s wizard would be fighting.  

: Clerics Symbol Series = This is an actual BUFF, that increases the targets ACTUAL HP's.  It lasts as long as it's designed duration, & then drops.

: So, wizards actually get shafted here. 

: I've started a new routine when joining a group, or adding a new member.  I give them my &quot;SCHPEAL&quot;, hehe.  I explain to them that, while I am in touch w/ Mithaniel Marr, I am NOT clairvoyant.  If they need buffs, they need to speak up & say so.  I don't offer Symbol, unless it's a good friend,, OR if someone either asks & offers to pay or hands me gems.
