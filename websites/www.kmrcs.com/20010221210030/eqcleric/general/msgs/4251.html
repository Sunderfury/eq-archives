Well in tougher battles (the only ones that count) complete heal is not a good thing to use if you don't have one or two backup healers. When you start casting that complete heal (it takes alot of time) on the main tank who needs it. If some caster gets jumped and needs an emergency heal - You are totally helpless to rescue him. And casters can drop FAST at higher levels, believe me.<p>Most of the time seperior heal will have to do. Until they do something about the casting time on complete heal (i personally think it should be faster to cast each level, but it's not right?)
