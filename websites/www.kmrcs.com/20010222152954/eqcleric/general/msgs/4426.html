: I was wondering if someone could tell me what level the giant skels in Rathe mtns are.  I group with a troll warrior, he's 21, I'm 20.  Would we be able to take one on?  Are they tough?  We are actually seeking a place to hunt as the lake is heavily camped.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks<p>The giant skels range from about 23 to 26 with the majority being 24<p>When I was lvl 22, a 21st lvl enchanter and I were able to take them out - but it was a good fight.<p>At 25 I could solo all but the toughest without much threat of being killed. Plus, by the time you're 25 you can also start getting in cyclops hunting groups in the same area.<p><br>
