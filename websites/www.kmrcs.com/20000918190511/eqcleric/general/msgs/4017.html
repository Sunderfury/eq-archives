In my experience with Befallen, it is the first place that you can get major trains going.  I didn't have very good luck on the 4 occasions I went there.  I ended up dying all 4 times I went there.  West commons you can get some pretty good hunting going both solo & with a group.  Soloing you can look for the individual wisps.  Use your summon hammer and beat/smite them.  You can get good xp and can also find regular/greater lightstones which sell for pretty good money.  The things to watch for in the zone is the hill giants, the griffens, the dark elf npc (Kizdean Gix, and occasionally Dragoon Z something) and the rare night spawn of werewolves.  Stay away from the young & regular kodiaks as they will ruin your world at this point in time.  If you sit near the toil booth (not far from the inn) the milita will help to provide some protection from the kodiaks & pumas and other stuff that roam around and will attack you.  If you are wanting to group you can generally always find a group to hunt the dervs.  They give pretty good xp and you get the occasional chance at a bronze weapon.  The cutthroat ring sell for a couple gold and 4/5 of the dervs will have them so that can add up quickly.<p><br>: CUrrently lvl 12, and wandering in E and W commons, I am wondering if I may go to Befallen (solo or group if any) or to Oasis.<br>: What do you think, fellow clerics ?<p>
