: As a dwarven race we only have 4 classes to play.  Rogues are broken so we have cleric, paladin or warriors.  We take longer to level, but this is because of our &quot;racial&quot; abilities

: Now lets list our advantages:
: You guys get higher wisdom
: But not the highest.. you know that humans are balanced.. You have higher intel and char then my dwarf

: your own armor, your own weapons,
: Sure and it easy as 1-2-3 to get.. No I don't think so.  Plus not there are weapons and armor that dwarves can not use. (clarity belt is one that comes to mind right away)

:  get to start in one of the best areas in the world

: Ah you get sense heading too.  How hard is it to click it and have your skill improve. It's not

: Not to mention the major advantage of being able to wear small armor, which allows you to wear the small bronze that is 1/3 the price of medium bronze armor and lighter. 
: Well what do you want us to do about size??  do you think that it is unfair that we pay less for less material? nope

: But lighter dosent matter anyway since your freaking strength is higher too.
: And our intel sucks and char is bad so we learn skills slower and pay more.

: EVERY race has plus and minus.  instead of being jealous, be proud of what your race does well
