 It's no surprise to me that the armor won't all increase wisdom.  In fact, I'll be shocked if anything other than the breasplate increases wisdom, simply because Verant wants to create tradeoffs between this armor and other armor in the game.<p> Giving clerics an entire suit of wisdom increasing plate mail with AC higher than steel plate would be pretty unbalancing.  This armor is the natural upgrade from steel plate, and is a placeholder until you can get the specialized items that add to wisdom.  I don't think they see it as the suit of armor you'd wear all the way through to level 50.
