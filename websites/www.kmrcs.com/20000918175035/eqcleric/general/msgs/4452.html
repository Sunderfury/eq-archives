In a high level team, a bard can be same important as a encharter.  But there is much less bard then encharter, at lease in my server.<p>Okay we cleric got nerfed simply because there is too much cleric around.  What about bard?  There is not enough bard around but Verant never improve them.<p>I play both encharter and bard, but bard needs more help in fact.  Making lag with song, Must stay in range to have effect, the only hybird cannot tank, no good group song in all 20ish.  They supposed to make lots difference in group but is almost broken now.<p>Encharter is pet class.  Since Verant is dreaming and playing with them.. doesn't matter on demand or customer needs.
