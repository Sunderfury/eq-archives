I know that when i first got my mith bp i was checking on what the difference was from my black enameled chest (25 ac)<br>The +15 agil gave me only 1 or 2 points extra AC over the 17 AC of the mith BP. So i got much better ac from my BE chest.<br>That +9 agil you got from the bracer must have put you over some major threshold<br>because this is the first time ive every heard of +9 agil granting 40 AC. Can you give me some more information?<br>Whats your agil and AC before and after putting on the bracer?<br>
