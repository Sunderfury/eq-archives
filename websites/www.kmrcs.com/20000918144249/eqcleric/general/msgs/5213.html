I've got Furor and I've been visiting BB and been taking down tough opponents.  I even saved a few rather rash Lvl 2 people who tried to take on a rabid grizzly.  I didn't end up killing the bear but I hurt him pretty badly and saved the overzealous warriors ;)<p>As for "Blinding Flash," I don't recall a spell like that.  Do you mean "Flash of Light?"  If so I didn't buy that because I thought it was a waste of time.  I heard that it blinds the enemy but only for a few seconds so is it REALLY worth the money?<p>: Furor was my best friend during these levels, but expect to spend some time on your butt regenerating mana (ugh, pre-meditation days, I hated them).<p>: You can actually take on the same stuff as a warrior your level, but with less down time.  As for what, I'm not sure.<p>: You do have blinding flash, right?  It's the clerics best friend.  Too bad I didn't start using it until 16 :(.<p>: Basically, just get in a whack or two, blind the MOB (not before you hit him, otherwise it works like fear, which is bad!) and bash and furor away!<p>: : Well... since working solo works well still at my level, what are some tips you (or anyone) could give me on how raise my experience the fastest way possible by going solo?  <p>: : Please, no smartass remarks like "kill more stuff."
