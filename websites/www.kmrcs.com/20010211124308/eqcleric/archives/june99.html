      <p>I have added spell effects for most of the spells for levels 1 - 19.&nbsp; There were a
      few spells (e.g. Symbol of Transal) I have never purchased and therefore am not positive
      on their effects.&nbsp; Also, I do not know the specifics on any spell beyond 19, having
      not reached 24 or higher.&nbsp; Please e-mail <a href="mailto:krusso@csoft.net">me</a>
      with any additions/corrections because if we have to wait for me to hit 50 to complete the
      list, well, another ice-age may hit first :P.</p>

      <p>The new spell list is now up (see Cleric Spells under Specific Topics).&nbsp; It is a
      script, with functionality similar to that found in the Magic Items script.&nbsp; The
      Cleric Spells script has the following features:</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Contains a complete list of all clerical spells (at least those found in Kaladim).</li>
        <li>Contains the mana cost and the approximate price.&nbsp; The test character used to check
          pricing was a Dwarven Cleric with 70 Charisma (25 higher than normal).&nbsp; Normal
          Dwarven clerics should expect to pay a little more; Human and High-Elven clerics can
          probably expect to pay a little less.</li>
        <li>The list can be displayed for all or just one levels.</li>
        <li>The spells can be cross-referenced with other classes, showing the level another class
          gets the spell.&nbsp; Either all other classes or just one can be displayed.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Numerous suggestions for improvements to the Cleric class have been made (after all,
      other classes seem to be getting tweaked, where's our's right?).&nbsp; I have an idea -
      let's fix Divine Aura.&nbsp; It is STILL bugged; I got stunned last night while
      invulnerable.&nbsp; This makes absolutely no sense.&nbsp; I could withstand a drop from
      the top of Kelethin, but some silly green /conning goblin can stun me?&nbsp; I /bug'd it
      again last night.&nbsp; Please do so fellow clerics.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>I have completed adding Damian's submission to the list.</li>
        <li>I have changed the name from Wisdom Items to Magic Items. &nbsp; These are still just
          wisdom/mana enhancing items.&nbsp; If any would like to see it expanded to a more general
          list, please let me know.</li>
        <li>Finally, I have modified the list from a straight HTML file to a Perl script which
          allows for search criteria to be entered.&nbsp; This allows for searches on a particular
          slot, zone location, name, or amount of mana added.&nbsp; It also has the minor benefit of
          making it <strong>much</strong> easier to update the list :P. I hope it proves to be
          useful.</li>

      by far the most bizarre thing that's ever happened to me.&nbsp; See the <a href="../images/clipprob.jpg">pic</a><strong>.</strong></p>

      strategies, tanks and trading off damage, mob targeting and other targeting strategies,
      Clerics as the battle quarterback, and anything else I can dig up from scouring old posts

      <p>Content currently contains the following:<ul>
        <li>Four player created guides to zones.</li>
        <li>Links to popular Everquest sites.</li>
        <li>Four maps (zones on Faydwer).</li>
        <li>A link to the EQ'Lizer's list of Clerical spells.</li>
        <li>A link to the mana calculator contained on the <a href="http://www.baelish.aust.com/everquest/">EQ Enchanter's</a> site.</li>
        <li>A link to the cleric guides contained on EQSS.&nbsp; The <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/classes_cle_ad.shtml">advanced guide</a> is particularly
          noteworthy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Concerning the maps: The four maps of Faydwer are <strong>not</strong> my original
      creations; they were copied and modified from maps found on the EQ'Lizer site.&nbsp; I
      modified them so that a printed image would fit on an 8 1'2&quot; x 11&quot; sheet of
      paper.&nbsp; I personally believe they are more useful this way.</p>
      <p>For a much more complete listing of maps, I recommend both the Eq'Lizer and
      Allakhazam's Magical Realm.&nbsp; They both have a wide variety of maps, although
      Allakhazam's is more useful due to the listing of multiple versions of some of the zones.
      &nbsp; Surprisingly enough, I find the Japanese versions of the zone maps the most useful,
      despite the language issue, due to the excellent attention to detail.</p>
