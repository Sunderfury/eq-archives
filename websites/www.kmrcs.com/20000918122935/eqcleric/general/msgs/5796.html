1) Make your party aware that healing taunts the MOBs around you.  Make a hotkey in big, bold letters to let them know you are being attacked.  Casters and melee types don't usually pay as much attention to group hps as we do.  They may not know you're in trouble until too late.  Inform your fighters that if they want healing, then they've got to protect you.<p>2) Try healing from a distance.  A lot of lower level MOB's have a small aggro range and won't attack you.  By level 24, it makes sense for the cleric not to be involved in melee anymore anyway.  This may not be possible in a place like Unrest, but in outdoors fighting like the Aviak village in South Karana it makes a huge difference.<p>3) If all else fails, you are mobbed, and no one can help you, cast Divine Aura and run for the zone.  It does no good for you to die.  Do what you can to save the group and then go.  Espcially in dungeons and especially after you get res spells, clerics are essential to corpse recovery.<p>The best thing you can do is train your fighters to protect you.  A fighter without a cleric is a dead fighter.  Make sure they know (or at least believe) that is true.  At higher levels, I guarantee you it is.<p>Lucretia Rialsq<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Bristlebane
