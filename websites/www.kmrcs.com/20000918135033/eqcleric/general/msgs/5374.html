I still have the guild tunic, 2 pieces of cloth armor, and a brand new Worn Great Staff.  So equipment wise- you are much better off.  Still don't have all my level 8 spells either.<p>You're a human?  I'd think you should be able to level faster.  Take on as many blues as you can, as fast as you can.  I never sit to rest (I just got meditate) until I'm less than 1/2 health, I usualy won't sit to regain mana because I can fight another low blue while it regens during the fight.  I died twice in this time period, once when I ran out of food at level 3 at decided I'd attack a guard (nice to get free food and water) and the second time right before level 5 when 3 orcs jumped me and I was 1/2 health (needed food again too, but this time it wasn't on purpose).  If you travel a lot or spend time wandering around trying to find things to kill, find another zone.  It's much easier when you can take stuff non-stop.<br>
