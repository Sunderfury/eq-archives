You don't need a Group, just a partner. One trick I use to find a partner is look for a Warrior or Monk at or a level about you.  Just check your WHO and contact them directly. "Do you want a personal Cleric?" I almost always get a YES.  Monks and a Cleric make a great team, Monks never want any of the loot and Cleric need all they can find.  Try a monk you'll like it.<br>
