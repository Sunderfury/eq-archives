          <blockquote>
            <p>By now, most of you should be aware of a recent change to the
            Feign Death skill/spell, shared by Monks, Necromancers, and
            Shadowknights.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday afternoon I saw many posts
            complaining that Verant <i>nerf</i>ed FD.&nbsp; I un-subscribed from
            EQ Monks many months ago (just not my favorite class) so it was
            rather surprising to see these posts.&nbsp; According to the many
            reports, FD was nerfed and there are many irate Monks out there (I
            have yet to check how Necro's and SK's feel about this).&nbsp;
            Finally, when I logged on last night, I read Verant's rather
            detailed explanation of the changes and the effects they have on the
            FD skill (for the record many monks disagree with many of the
            points).</p>
            <p>My complaint is this: why wasn't this announced Tuesday with the
            rest of the patch information?&nbsp; There seems to be a trend of
            late when it comes to patches:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Verify that Verant made the changes they say they did.</li>
              <li>Discover new changes (typically <i>nerfs</i> of some sort)
                that were not announced.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is a disturbing trend and one they must cease
            immediately.&nbsp; Any time they make a change <b>announce it</b>.&nbsp;
            Players <b>hate</b> to log in and discover negative changes that
            were slipstreamed into the game.&nbsp; I for one do not like to
            discover that certain skills or abilities were <i>nerf</i>ed for any
            class.&nbsp; It makes me feel that the company is sneaky, and
            frankly I had enough of that with a previous popular online
            game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Players are going to complain regardless, but when they have the
            added fuel of discovering a hidden change, they typically go
            ballistic with moral indignation.&nbsp; Kind of hard to blame them.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><b><font color="#804040">On the other hand, I really enjoy the game</font></b></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>And have been very happy with many of the recent changes (e.g.
            Kithicor, Kedge Keep).&nbsp; The re-tuning of Paw, one of my
            favorite dungeons, has me ecstatic.&nbsp; I just hope they get it
            done before I out level it (well, no real danger there).&nbsp; We
            complained about a lack of class-specific items; they added a slew
            of them.&nbsp; The fact that some of the class/race restrictions
            lists are buggy is a somewhat minor point (actually rather
            humorous).&nbsp; The only thing that I would like to see them change
            at this moment would be to restrict the higher level mobs to one
            side of the main path through Kithicor (preferably the side opposite
            Rivervale).&nbsp; I don't think travel through the zone should be
            totally safe for low level characters, but right now it is extremely
            dangerous, perhaps overly dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

            </ul>
            <p>Also, they have recently added many, many class specific
            items.&nbsp; I remember writing a few months ago that the options
            for 35+ characters were SolB and LGuk; obviously that is no longer
            the case.</p>

            overwrought, it isn't worth it.&nbsp; I personally am not enamored
            of the armor, although I would like a set of the bracers (yes, they
            are better than the Chipped Bone I currently possess).&nbsp; No, I
            don't plan on camping hard for them.&nbsp; I wish all the quests
            were similar to the Caduceus quest (took me maybe an hour and a
            half).&nbsp; I don't like ground spawns.&nbsp; Ok, it's all been
            said before.&nbsp; Look at one of the <a href="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000298.html" style="color: #0000FF">posts</a>
            by Akane; she makes an excellent point.&nbsp; Verant gave us pretty
            good armor (well, better than steel plate) and a damned nice
            weapon.&nbsp; With these changes and the recent sit/med change, they
            have done a <b>lot</b> to improve the game for our class.&nbsp; I'm

          <blockquote>
            <p>If you haven't heard by now, with the most recent patch Paladins
            and Shadowknights had their quest armor's AC increased.&nbsp; That's
            great; as plate wearing classes it was odd, to say the least, that
            their armor provided less protection than the quest armor available
            to chain classes.&nbsp; Um, what about clerics?&nbsp; Aren't we a
            plate class also?&nbsp; Why do I still have the feeling that the
            designer's at Verant are not communicating on the quests.&nbsp; I
            feel that our armor should be on par with the other plate classes,
            leaving aside the entire issue of the AC of the chain classes.</p>
            <p>I have a suggestion for Verant.&nbsp; Provide a forum where the
            rationales behind such decisions are made available.&nbsp;
            Currently, if you want direct feedback you can either e-mail someone
            you happen to know at Verant, e-mail an address blindly and pray for
            a response, or post something on Alt.Games.Everquest and again hope
            that it catches Brad McQuaid's attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There may be a very good reason why the cleric quest armor did
            not receive an upgrade.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can't imagine what it
            could be.</p>

            <p>Last weekend I received a reply from GZ on a few questions I
            asked him.&nbsp; To paraphrase:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Manastones have been removed from the drop table and will
                return as a quest (I did not ask him when).</li>
              <li>The conversion rate on Manastones is 60 Hit Points for 20 Mana
                (not the widely reported 60-30).</li>
              <li>There is no such thing as <i>Armor Absorption</i>, it's purely
                AC.</li>
              <li>Spells do <b>not</b> get better with use beyond that which is
                dictated by the character's level and skill with the particular
                spell discipline (e.g. Evocation or Alteration).&nbsp;
                Therefore, casting Holy Might 1000s of times does not increase
                ones success with the spell once Evocation has been maxed for
                that level.</li>
