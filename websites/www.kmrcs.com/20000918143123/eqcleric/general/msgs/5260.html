Hey I know what boat you are on.  I'm married with 2 kids also, so I know about the distractions & such.  I agree with the thought that it's too much of a hassle.  That's why I didn't even bother trying to do any of the stuff last night.  After reading all the posts this morning, I'm glad I didn't waste any time.  I did manage to gain just over 1 bubble of xp last night in about 1 1/2 hours so I'm feeling it was better spent levelling then running around all over and not having anything to show for it.  As far as being able to buy the items eventually I believe the component pieces as well as the final equipment piece is no drop, so you will have to do it yourself if you want the item.<p><p>: I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't have 6 <br>: to 8 hours a night to sit and look at my monitor!  Hard <br>: enough for me to get time to play as I'm married with kids<br>: (slight distraction at times :-)).<p>: It is hard enough getting time to just get experience and<br>: earn some decent money.  Now I hear I'll have to waste<br>: 6 hours or so to get Cleric only items.  Oh boy!<p>: I'll just keep worrying about getting experience and working<br>: on leveling screw the cleric only stuff.

The guantlets seemed to be fairly decent, but the boots seem to be a waste of time in my opinion.  Is it just me or what?  I don't have any plan to even attempt to do any of these quest in the near future.  Perhaps someday (a month or 2) down the road I might give some thought to doing these quests or such, but I just don't feel that the items are worth all of the hassle that I've been hearing from other clerics about the wait and trying to find the NPC's and that kinda stuff.<p>: : Course that's just my personal opinion.<p>
