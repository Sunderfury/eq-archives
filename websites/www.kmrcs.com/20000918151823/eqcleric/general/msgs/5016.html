Unrest is fine for you, but getting past the guards at the docks on both ends is a bit hard.  Easier if you can get a teleport to Faydwer (especially by a druid).<p>So Ro undead are not a bad idead either, if you want to solo or group for the orcs in Oasis (hated doing crocs- no loot).<p>Weapons- FS is okay, Cold Iron is better, RTS is not too bad an idea at your level (I never did get 2HB over bad).<p>As for practice points, I have tons saved up.  Start a trade skill or just keep em.  You want to make sure you save some fo when you get Specialization, but other than that I've rarely used any.

: Unrest is fine for you, but getting past the guards at the docks on both ends is a bit hard.  Easier if you can get a teleport to Faydwer (especially by a druid).

: So Ro undead are not a bad idead either, if you want to solo or group for the orcs in Oasis (hated doing crocs- no loot).

: Weapons- FS is okay, Cold Iron is better, RTS is not too bad an idea at your level (I never did get 2HB over bad).

: As for practice points, I have tons saved up.  Start a trade skill or just keep em.  You want to make sure you save some fo when you get Specialization, but other than that I've rarely used any.
