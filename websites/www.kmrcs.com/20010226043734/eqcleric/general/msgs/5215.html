Same at burned out cabin in Kithicor - been way over an hour. And I heard same story for gnome in befallen, and get this - after 6 hours, a putrid skeleton placeholder spawned.

To add insult to injury the Tashania Coins spawn every 5 minutes (Gee I wonder which will be more sought out).<p>: Anyway, maybe the Ingot/Icon spawns in a random location underwater in Upper Guk. Probably not though, looks like the lame 6+ Hr respawn rumors were right, yay ...<p>
