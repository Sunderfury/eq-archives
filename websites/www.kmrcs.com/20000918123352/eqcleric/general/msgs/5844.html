I mean, come on.  This KORRAL, can barely form structured sentences.  It's far too easy AND FUN, I might add, to simply post him to the cross of humility, & flog him w/ verbal retorts he doesn't even understand!<p>It's clear, that if he had ANY gray matter, in that HUGE melon on top of his neck, he's be joining the fight of the righteous!<p>Tomma Trueheart<br>Priestess of Mithaniel Marr, 26th Rosary<p>
