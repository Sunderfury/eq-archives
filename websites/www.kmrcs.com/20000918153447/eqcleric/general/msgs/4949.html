What this spell essentially does is reset the mobs hate list.<p>If the mob is a deepwater croc that is non-agro you atone and walk away from a losing fight (of course everything is agro by the time you get atone (anything that can kick your butt that is)<p>In the case of an agro you need to get out of it's agro radius before casting atone.  If you reset it's hate list...yet it hates the closest PC...and you are the closest...you wasted mana.<p>But if a mob frenzies on you because you did a few huge heals and the wizard roots it off you...you can atone it and the warriors can taunt it off easily.

: What this spell essentially does is reset the mobs hate list.

: If the mob is a deepwater croc that is non-agro you atone and walk away from a losing fight (of course everything is agro by the time you get atone (anything that can kick your butt that is)

: In the case of an agro you need to get out of it's agro radius before casting atone.  If you reset it's hate list...yet it hates the closest PC...and you are the closest...you wasted mana.

: But if a mob frenzies on you because you did a few huge heals and the wizard roots it off you...you can atone it and the warriors can taunt it off easily.
