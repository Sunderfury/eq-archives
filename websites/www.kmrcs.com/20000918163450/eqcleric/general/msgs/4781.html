That kinda stuff happens to me all the time, and the worst part is that people get mad at you when you are telling them that you are busy with something else. If we where to go res. everyone that asked for it, we would'nt be doing anything else but ressing... I try to go every time someone in guild asks me to, but since this last patch it's nearly hopeless to help out every time. It can take a while to drop everything you are doing and it can also take a while for the other group (who lost a member or two) to retrieve the corpses...<p>Sometimes it is'nt enough time to even res someone in your own group or even yourself. I died in "hand room" in lower guk a while ago, and we had all kinds of problems getting the group back together and invisibility dropped a couple of times so we had to evac etc etc... We got there, i think in 1 hour and 45 mins or so, and guess what, when we got there the corpse was lost in the wall.. took 30 mins before we got a GM to help out and bye bye to that res/exp....<p>2 hours is not enough. At least give us like 4 or 5 hours...<p>/ Lito, 44 Cleric, <br>  Prexus server.<br>
