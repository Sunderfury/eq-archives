: Everyone has a learning curve in the game, and everyone tries to find out what their roll is (by the class they chose).  We all know that there are some that never find it.

: If you are lower level and in a place where you are getting a lot of MOBs on your group, I'd hope to god you had a cleric with you.  Clerics generally will save much more mana for heals than either a shaman or a druid.  Some of those DOTs that they can cast also take a lot more time to kill the MOBs than the &quot;normal&quot; battle.  

: Let's take Unrest as one example.  Some clerics will use their Undead DD spells here, which are much more efficient than the DOTs are.  We'll take the knight, for instance, his battle is what- 2 minutes tops, either you're dead or he is.  That's if the spawn is cleared of course.  If you have to clear Hags, DB, Monks, ect. then the battle gets longer.  How do you tell the group to fight?  Everyone on the hags first, then on the knight, then on the rest of the stuff.  I would rather have a cleric casting an Undead DD spell than a DOT that will never reach the end of it's damage potential.

: If the Shaman casts a DOT on the hag, then starts DOTing the remaining MOBs he won't be alive by the time you kill the rest of the jump there.  A cleric can at least go DA for 18 seconds after a healing someone.

: My take at least, as I've played a Druid to 28, a Monk to 22, a Ranger to 26, a Necro to 18, and a cleric to 44 (plus a couple others).

: I'm glad that you play the classes that you want to.  Everyone should.
