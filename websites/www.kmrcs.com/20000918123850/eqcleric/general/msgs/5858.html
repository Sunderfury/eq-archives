Personally I like all the classes and what they each bring to the game. Sure there are things I'm jealous of that others have or can do but I can deal with it. Sure there are things - such as this armor that I will complain about - but I go on my merry way and let it go too.<p>What I can't stand though are people like you (no matter what class they are) that think they are far superior to everyone else as you seem to think you are.  I'm surprised you get groups with an attitude like this.  There are plenty of others out there that understand the value each class brings to the table.<p>By the way.. if you are so superior - why are you out on our board complaining that we have the best equipment? <p>Trewithen Woundhealer<br>Tribulation Force<br>Priest of Tunare<br>Povar<p><br>: u want server? Bertox, there u go! & I couldnt care less if u group with me u lose out cuz u cant do crap without me and other tanks cleric r a dime a dozen i just hate when u guys whine about stuff.... u have the best equip in the game and get to wear PLATE, stop bitching!<br>: KORRAL ON BERTOX<p>
