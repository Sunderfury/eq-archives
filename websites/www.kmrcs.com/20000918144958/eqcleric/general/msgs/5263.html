Well the reason for the first post was to let other people know that for the Dwarf race there is a fairly good item - not the usual blackened stuff.  Didn't mean to hit that sore spot about other races not being able to wear the armor.  Sorry.<p><p><br>: You almost sounded a little suprised there?? Of course it's just dwarf clerics who can wear it. That's what they designed the cleric class for I guess, since everything good for clerics in this game are for dwarf clerics only.<p>: /gUmbAA<p>
