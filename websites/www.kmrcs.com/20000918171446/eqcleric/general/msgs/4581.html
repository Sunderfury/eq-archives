They spend the same amount of time medding. They have much less AC and worse buffs.  In return they get better nukes, pets, or something... to avoid actual combat.  They are no more powerful then a cleric. <p>Ask 5 warriors what they want to fill slot 6.<p>I agree variety is nice but you didn't mention any ideas on what to add. Your comparision vs. other classes was weak (don't compare 1 class vs. 4 classes).<p>Have you ever tried another class to let's say lvl 20 or so? If you did you would not complain so much.  I have access to a character over 20 in almost every class except bard or wizard.<p>My two favorites are my cleric and enchanter.<p>P.S. ever get balanced in power due to the fact you can summon a pet? Then go deep in dungeons with pathing problems (read any dungeon)? You have to kill your own pet and play as half a man....<p>Please let me know what you expect to find in PoF that suits your role better and adds variety. It would help your argument ALOT.

: First off most casters items are INT solely.  Nothing else..maybe AGI on the high lvl stuff.

: Second variety of spells? You can heal, nuke, buff, fear, stun, aoe nuke, and you can melee somewhat if need be on a green.

: Wizards can nuke, aoe nuke, or gate. Oh and stun. Buffs, heals, fear, lull those are not options.  Melee? not even on a low green....

: Warriors, monks, rogues...lets see the variety.  Show it to me.

: Rangers, SK, Paladins...more variety then pure melee but still nothing to exceed a cleric.

: Granted the other 3 casters and 2 priests may have more options. They spend the same amount of time medding. They have much less AC and worse buffs.  In return they get better nukes, pets, or something... to avoid actual combat.  They are no more powerful then a cleric. 

: Ask 5 warriors what they want to fill slot 6.

: I agree variety is nice but you didn't mention any ideas on what to add. Your comparision vs. other classes was weak (don't compare 1 class vs. 4 classes).

: Have you ever tried another class to let's say lvl 20 or so? If you did you would not complain so much.  I have access to a character over 20 in almost every class except bard or wizard.

: My two favorites are my cleric and enchanter.

: P.S. ever get balanced in power due to the fact you can summon a pet? Then go deep in dungeons with pathing problems (read any dungeon)? You have to kill your own pet and play as half a man....

: Please let me know what you expect to find in PoF that suits your role better and adds variety. It would help your argument ALOT.
