My english is not so good, but i will try it :-)<p>The first peace is in runnyeye on a gobline named sludge. Go down to the water near the king aera. Follow the water to the right. You will come to a big room with a fountain. Jump into the fountain and dive a little bit down. The ground of the fountain is the place where sludge spawns. Hes around level 32 and was not hard to solo. Theres also a 2nd way... On the water by the king area, follow the water to the left. Jump in the water and dive into the small tunnel underwater. Follow the tunnel... on the end of the tunnel you will find sludge (or not if he was killed). If you dive up then, you jump out of the fountain (see above).<p>The 2nd peace is in dagnors cauldron on a gob named bilge wandering around.<p>
