: Clerics are always primaraly buffer's/healers there not question about that but on a number of occations I have found Nuking the best practice in a group situation. Possible reasons for burning include:

: The obvious kill off a runner; finish it if it's low health and beserking on your tanks; pulling the mob of a team member; kill one or two mobs quickly if multiple mobs are fighting your party.

: The mob in question is hard hitting either through spells or just bashing. In these situations the cost of burning can actuly prove more mana effective.

: Split mana costs. In a fair number of parties I have been in were mobs are being taken down quickly you are a acualy helping more by burning mana than sitting around waiting to heal or just stuning. The main reason is that the more damage you do to a mob the less the other real caster in the group are having to do and the mana costs are split bettwean you.

: Both of these situations came up for me last night in lower Guk fighting the hand.

: hand: kept it stuned
: Undead Frog Wizards: stun - nuke (occational second nuke but not normaly nessasery)
: - Wizard hit hard and they need to go down quickly
: Undead Frog Knights: stun/nuke/melee
: - tanks melee the thing and casters dot/debuff/burn, helping out on the burning get's the mob down quicker and helps other casters save mana (3 of 4 undead nukes for 270+ a popcan rearly help do this)

: As a side not all the group was fully buffed (including symbol on the tanks) and everyone got healing when they needed to. Although it wasn't actualy possible to outburn the pure casters, I alwasy hold back mana for heals. If fact for most of the time I was around 80 - 100% mana. Admitadly clarity and having mobs debuffed rearly helped here. But there are definate advantages to nuking in some situations.
