Play the way you want to.  Obviously you will need more wis - but you have to remember as a cleric your spells come first.  When you are close to levelling to a new spell level, go out and purchase all the spells you want/need.  Then if you have any money left over afterwards, you can look to buy some of the other stuff.  An unprepared cleric is not a good boat to be in.  Ex:  If you spent 150 pp for some armor or a weapon or something that seemed nice and then didn't have enough money to buy that much needed spell, it was a waste.  Concentrate on spells first, then save a bit of money to buy some of the nicer armor pieces like +3 wis earrings, +6 rings and so forth.  These items are pretty expensive (unless you know somebody who will make them for cost), so start saving.<p><br>: I posted a similar question on another board before I found this one.  Please don't consider it spamming - I think I just have a better chance of good advice here.<p>: Beello has full banded, a savant's cap, SSoL, and a few mana increasing rings and earings.  He also has 140 pp in the bank and prospects of raising an additional 20-30 by the time he needs to buy his level 14 spells.  Of course this raises opportunity of spending 100+ on something.<p>: Beello has solo'ed his whole life, but will now begin grouping in a support roll, so I think additional/different weapons are not a high priority.<p>: Mana increasing, either directly or through wisdom increasing, seems like a good idea.  I saw Z's Coronet auctioned for ~125pp last week, more than I had at the time.  Is this a good idea?  Where does it come from - maybe I would have a better shot at buying it in that zone.  <p>: Any other ideas?  BTW, if anyone knows of Mithanial Marr guilds with mature people who play for fun, I would like to hear about them.  Thanks for all the help, and congratulations on a great site!<p>: Beello (whose second name will be Urneez!)<p>
