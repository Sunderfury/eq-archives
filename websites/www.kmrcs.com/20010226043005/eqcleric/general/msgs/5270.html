Anyone have this happen to them before?   Is this a<br>known bug, like the zone bug?<p>I was in W Freeport, and had time to kill waiting for<br>some friends to get online, and I tried to do the quest<br>where you kill the halfling named Shintl Lowbrew in<br>one of the inns.  Well, my Smite got partially resisted<br>and only did around 4 damage, and Shintl takes off like<br>a halfing out of collapsing sandhole.  As I chase her<br>down, I keep getting "Your casting was interrupted"<br>and she makes it out into the street.  I chase her past<br>the Academy of Arcane Science, and as she rounds a<br>corner, I follow her to find myself face to face with<br>a Militia guard.  At level 15 (and that just barely)<br>I'm no match for him, and I don't run very far....<p>So I run back from my bind point in North Ro to where<br>I died.  I see Shintl Lowbrew still standing a short<br>distance away, so I know I'm in the right place, but...<br>no corpse.  I did /corpse and ran all over the<br>surrouding area trying to summon... no luck.  I found<br>a bard, and she said it was curious, but her Corpse<br>Song kept leading her into a wall.  So I'm thinking<br>that somehow I died and fell into a wall, and now I'm<br>trapped in the terrain.  At this point a GM Guide<br>answers my petition, asks a few questions (Are you<br>sure you're looking in the area you died?  Have you<br>asked a bard?), then said he was escalating it to the<br>GMs, please be patient as the new patch has them going<br>a little bit bonkers right now...<p>So, here I am, back at level 14 (I *HATE* it when that<br>happens), no corpse, naked.  As I'm sitting down in a<br>funk to memorize my spells and summon some food and<br>water for the wait, someone shouts for a bind.  I figure<br>while I'm not doing anything, might as well do it.<p>So I ask where, and he says he's at the West Gate, but<br>he's KOS with the guards, can I please come outside the<br>gate, turn right and follow the wall a little ways.  So<br>I do that, and as I'm running through the newbie zone,<br>what do you think I pass?  My corpse!  How on EARTH<br>did it get way out here?<p>Anyway, I got my stuff, PLUS 7pp for the bind.  But I'm<br>still shuddering at the thought that I might be in a<br>place MUCH more dangerous sometime, and die, only to<br>return and find my corpse isn't where I died....<p>Gorgrim<br>Servant of Underfoot<br>Deacon of the 14th Hammer (once again)<br>Tarew Marr
