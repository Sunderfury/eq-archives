: Well, I've basically had it with camping little brown bags that spawn in the middle of nowhere for 7 hours.

: From what i've heard, all the other classes have their items spawn on regular mobs, but as a rare spawn...so why the h*ll do we have to camp ours for 7 hours?!

: And on the top of it, the armor basically sucks...i mean c'mon...6 sv vs disease on the boots? wow...at the time you have the 250pp required to get the bars and get them enchanted, you will at least have endure disease - i bet alot of us already has resist disease as well.

: The gauntlets look decent - but yet again we have to camp rare spawns / drops for 7 hours.

: I'm fed up with it...im gonna help our ranger get his quest armor, and then grab the rubi parts i am missing (gloves, arms and helm) from him.

: Whenever someone gets the info out on some stats, then we can see which pieces are worth getting...the gold look would've been very nice - but i just cant take staring at a treestump for 5-6 hours.

: When i logged on this morning before going to work to check on the diary, Bandayd was standing there...he had been there for *4* hours! waiting for it to spawn...i must applaude him on his patience.

: To all of you that will continue doing the quests, i wish you the best of luck - maybe when we get some stats on the rest and find out if some of the items might actually be worth getting - i will bother doing it...but as it looks now - no way.


: You ignore a_new_cleric_quest_05 for 484 points of damage

: Thkeron begins to cast a spell

: a_new_cleric_quest_05 has been struck down by wrath!

: You have slain a_new_cleric_quest_05
