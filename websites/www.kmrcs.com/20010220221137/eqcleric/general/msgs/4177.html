Posted by Ainvar on October 04, 1999 at 14:07:05:<p>
I am a cleric of the 15th season. I was hunting in Highpass Hold last night with a full group. Looting was not organized, but was rather just try to loot every sixth corpse. However, we agreed that if a named orc spawned, we would all type /random 1 100 and whoever had the highest number would get the loot. I got 97 and won the loot off of a guy named Shralok something. He carried a pack with eight slots and that has a 20-25% weight reduction. The pack can also hold any sized item. Members of my group said that it usually sells for between 200 and 300 pp. I have not sold it yet, but I have had several offers. My question is, if I get 300 pp, what should I buy. Right now I have almost all banded armor except for a dwarven ringmail tunic. I have no earings, but I have a derv ring and a rat shaped ring(+10 sv disease and posion) for my fingers. For my weapon I have Bullsmasher and my summoned hammer if I need something magical.<p>I am looking for suggestions on what armor I should buy. Should I go with just buying lots of bronze, or should I just buy one or two pieces of much better armor. Please give some suggestions.<br>
