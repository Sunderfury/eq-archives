Throught all the levels from 1 - 33 we are not the be all and end all when it comes to healing.

: Throught all the levels from 1 - 33 we are not the be all and end all when it comes to healing. We are better at healing throughout all these levels, although the differance is minimal for about 50% of these levels. At the points were these diferances are minimal our hp/ac buffs however are generaly better than any other class.

: While I grouped with the same party almost exclusivily through to 29, I never had problems getting grouped if I wasn't with them, and have never had problems getting grouped since 30 (unless there is no party needing members in the zone - only happoned a couple of times).

: At 34 we recieve our new & unique healing spells, since this level I have been grouping with groups as high as 50th. At this point no one can match our healing skills. Saying we dont come into our own until level 40 is deffinatly extream. I havn't even reached that point but find it difficult to beleive it could get much better.

: Regardless of healing, we do have very good buffs and on occation good nukes and utility spells as well.

: : i have to be honest.. but we are pretty useless all the way up until level 40, the way it is now.. druids and shamans have much more to offer a group than a cleric have all the way to this high level, since most of the time we even have SAME HEALS as druids for example (who can offer so much more besides just heal)......

: : anyway, at 40 we are better healers than other classes and on 44 (when we get new spells) we actually can both solo and group very easy...

: : So both positive and negative news =).. i almost gave up many times between 20 and 30 because i was getting NOWHERE.
