What level is this guy 10-20?  Well, he's actually right that druids/shaman can heal just like a cleric.  It's for all of like 8 levels, and their buffs are nice too, but not as good as cleric buffs (for AC/HP- the things that keep him alive).  I hope he keeps spouting after he gets to level 30 and see what kind of groups he gets then.  Try telling the other members of your group to take that shaman/druid (or heck- even a pally, they get healing) over a cleric.  He'll be groupless pretty darn fast.  Oh, almost forgot- don't ask for a res when your body is deep in a dungeon.  I guess you'll have to try to make it back to your body nekked.<p>Heck, I'd take a monk over a warrior anyday- unless the Warriro has a POF weapon, a monk will outdamage him anyway.
