OK Just a few question about your computer,<p>1.  How much ram do you have?<br>I started with 64 megs and was going LD alot, now i have 128 megs and go ld maybe once or twice a night and that was with either a 56k modem or now my cable modem.<p>2.  What is your processor speed?  <br>My friend has 266 and disconnect more than me and i have a 300. Another friend has 400 and does not go LD except on rare ocasions.
