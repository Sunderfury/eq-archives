: My attitude is fine.  Throughout all my levels people I have grouped with have always complimented me.

I am posting this in light of alot of new clerics out there to think before they put such an investment into a character like this.  Its not a flame, if your happy with your cleric fine then this message isn't for you.<p>: I get tired of this, "Its always easy to get in a group as a cleric".<p>: At low levels it is very hard, but it is just as hard at higher levels.  <p>: The servers are aged now and continue aging, and high level clerics are becoming "surplus". <p>: You are left with 2 places to play at high levels (I wouldn't even consider fear).  SolB and lower guk are your only choices.  These zones are moreso overpopulated with clerics.  The scale of 1 cleric per 6 people goes over easily all the time.  In alot of these places it is simply not effective to have more than 1 cleric per group.<p>: Thus, have a seat.<br>:   <br>: Ya think I'd get to a high level if I had a crummy attitude?<p>: Just because YOU don't have a problem finding a group doesn't mean EVERYONE is like you.<p>: Like I said.  Head to a HIGH level dungeon that has an overpopulace of Clerics.  Now lets see if you can get into a group.<p>I'll ask this again, as you seem to have missed it, or maybe you just don't want to answer it.  What server are you playing on?  I play on Bristlebane and I have found there is a shortage of higher level clerics.  Perhaps in time that won't be the case.  I've heard melee classes complaining that they have trouble because there are just too many of them.  So what?  If you're chosing a cleric just because you think no one is playing them, you're chosing it for the wrong reason. Everyone has some trouble at higher levels.  That's because to do any serious hunting in a high level dungeon you must have a party.  As more and more people reach higher levels, the dungeons are more and more crowded.  There is no class out there that is going to guarantee that you get a party all of the time.<p>It seems that you are in the minority though in thinking that there are too many high level clerics.  Perhaps you should post what server you are on.  That would be better information than just a generic claim that high level areas are overcrowded with clerics posted by someone anonymous.<p>Lucretia Rialsq<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Bristlebane
