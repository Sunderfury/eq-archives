I am currently level 24 (just hit yesterday).  I don't see why everybody seems to think that the cleric class sucks so much.  I have had no major complaints with my class.  I have soloed & grouped with little difficulty all the way until now.  I started off soloing until around level 12 then I grouped for a short period of time, then I went back to soloing and kept switching.  If I could find a group in the area I was at, I grouped.  If I couldn't find a group (which wasn't very often) or didn't feel like grouping, I went to places I knew I could solo.  Maybe it took longer to level soloing the easy blue stuff, but oh well.  I get compliments all the time from groups that I'm in about how well I heal and how I take pride in my given profession.  For those of you that are having problems, maybe you need to take a step back and re-examine yourself and see what you are doing wrong.<p><p><br>: Throught all the levels from 1 - 33 we are not the be all and end all when it comes to healing. We are better at healing throughout all these levels, although the differance is minimal for about 50% of these levels. At the points were these diferances are minimal our hp/ac buffs however are generaly better than any other class.<p>: While I grouped with the same party almost exclusivily through to 29, I never had problems getting grouped if I wasn't with them, and have never had problems getting grouped since 30 (unless there is no party needing members in the zone - only happoned a couple of times).<p>: At 34 we recieve our new & unique healing spells, since this level I have been grouping with groups as high as 50th.
