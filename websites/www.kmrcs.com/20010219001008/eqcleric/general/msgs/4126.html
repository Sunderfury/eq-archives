You guys must be high elves or erudites...<p>Halflings and dwarves max at like 118 or 115 wis. A human would max at like 110 (75base+10clr+25stat mod).<p>Hell my enchanter has a 90 INT base and 80 CHA base and those are her main attributes.  And she does fine at lvl 35. I don't go full burn in a fight because it is a sure taunt and I med to full between each fight (which is shorter because I have less mana even if I did go oom...but I like to hover around 40 percent after a fight.)<p>Main thing to remember is it just means you have better stats somewhere else. A cleric with higher agi or sta means they live longer in a frenzy.
