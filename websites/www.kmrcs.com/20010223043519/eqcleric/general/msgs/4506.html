: The negative faction hits from killing Treants are:

: Jagged pine treefolk - Surefall Glade residents
: Guards of Qeynos - Qeynos and Karanas guards
: Protectors of Pine - Surefall Glade Rangers (guards)
: Guardians of the Vale - Rivervale Warriors (guards)

: There is no stated faction hit with druids, but I do know of several people who were dubious to the various druids before killing treants and are now KOS. The faction increase with the Unkempt Preservers may negatively affect standing with other druids. 

: I do not know how severe the faction hit is either. Do you have to kill 100 to be KOS, or only 10?
