But, lately<br>that seems not to be enough for my reg group. They also<br>expect me to melee, and nuke. Now we've been fighting<br>mobs without me doing this and we do just fine. They <br>keep on instisting that I'm 1/2 warrior and 1/2 healer,<br>(this is also a reason to leave 2 or 3 monsters beat on<br>me while they fight the other one.
