: I'm preparing an organized petition to Verant about the armor issue.  Hopefully I'll have news about this soon if it's going to work.  In the mean time, please post suggestions about what they can do about the armor here.  And people make them realistic.  Thanks.<br>-------------------------------<p>While I am all for your petition, Verant will not listen, they have demonstrated this in the past.  They are stubborn, and single minded.<p>They need to change the "quests" period, as they are not quests.  Definitely does nothing but promote camping worse than ever.<p><br>
