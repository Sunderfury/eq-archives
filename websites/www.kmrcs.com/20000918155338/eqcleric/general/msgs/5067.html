Ok, these are just my opinions on playing an enchanter, since I don't have one.<p>I think one thing that may define it for you is this, do you like being involved in the battle?  If you do, then an enchanter is perhaps the way to go.  Enchanters spend as much time medding and buffing, but instead of healing, they help manage the extra mobs that are brought by the puller or spawn when the group is finishing a pull.  Both clerics and enchanters can be lifesavers (my enchanter meses mobs off me when healing taunts).<p>Enchanters are very hard to play until level 24, though.  Even after that, you have to constantly train the people who have never grouped with an enchanter how to fight with an enchanter.  They can get you killed quickly if they don't listen to you.<p>Clerics are a little easier to play before level 24 and people understand more in a general sense what they do.  I think the main thing that has always drawn me to a character is friends.  If there's a potential regular group you can join, base the decision on that and you'll find any class you play rewarding.<p>Lucretia Rialsq<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Bristlebane.<p><p><p><br>
