Seems many players are expecting PoF armor here. And even it has very few peices that are +wis. This armor is supposed to "replace" rubcite. Which it is comaparable to. So whats the big deal. Where is this rule that class specific armor MUST add +'s to main attribute(s)? I just cant jump on this bandwagon. <p>: Ok, here it goes.  i got the new cleric legs and i think they are nice.  only problem i have is with one of the stats.  the stats are ac11 +5int +5sv poison.  we are clerics and are wisdom based so why would they put int on our legs?  i think its a type, so i petitioned it.  the gm (who was really cool) told me he thinks its odd for us to have int buff rather then wisdom and to report it as a bug.  well i did, and he said he was going to report it as well.  if you guys agree with me will you please report this as a bug next time your on and petition it as well so we can try to get this fixed?  please give me feedback via this post or my e-mail.<p>: Gallanorf<br>: 35 cleric E'CI<p>
