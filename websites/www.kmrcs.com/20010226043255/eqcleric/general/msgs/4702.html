Group buffs are the forte' of Bards, not clerics. <p>Now, I would like to see the Courage line get a group buff. At one circle higher, you get the previous cirlce buff. This is only to save time and mana. But bards get a song for group resists and such.<p>i.e. Bravery is level 24, then at level 29 you get group Daring. Valor is 34, so at 39 you get group Bravery.<p>Dik<p>
