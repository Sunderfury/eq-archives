In Reply to: <a href="4062.html">This is my view on the subject.</a> posted by Grim on October 01, 1999 at 14:30:58:<p>
I have noticed gogrim is common to attack people he doesnt agree with.  He will use these long winded post, where he basically ties together a bunch of use free associations with contradictions that he never really says anything coherent or meaningful.  I have learned not to read his posts, they are always very long, and very boring (except when needing a good laugh).<p>Dont let him work ya up.  I think he is a 13 yr old with a decent vocabulary but without the mental capacity to use it properly.<p>Later<p>(now gogrim, are you experiencing positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, or punishment? ;)<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>: 1.)  Corpses:  Yes there were too many and something had to be done.<p>: 2.)  A 2 hr time limit is just not enough time to res someone in alot of cases.  The time it takes to organize people for a romp for a corpse retrieval can take a long time.<p>: If it had an 8 hr - 24hr time on it, I would have absolutely no problem with it.  It gave people an adequate time to get ressed.<p>: Now the reason for the protest:<p>: Verant is using a game mechanic to get rid of some of the lag but at the expense of the clerics most distinquishable spell in the game.  Call it what you will, in the process it is a nerfing of our ressurect line of spells.<p>: Now the reason for what I do in game with corpses:<p>: While this change was on the test shard we already voiced our views on it.  Verant didn't budge.  Now, if Verant sees the amount of corpses reduce they will figure they did there job and move on and forget about it.  Res is the only true spell in the game which makes Clerics unique.  And yes, this changed nerfs our ability to res.<p>: Now, when Verant sees that corpse counts are not falling as well as the feedback which players leave them when they leave a corpse, maybe then they will re-address the issue.<p>: If you don't give Verant a reason to address an issue, they will just not address it.<p>: I will continue to do what I do.  I will res people and ask them to leave a junk item on their corpse if they want to show support for it.  I also ask them to send feedback to Verant as to why they are leaving a naked corpse.<p>: :: Sorry you feel that its a meaningless protest when it actually has merit.  May I ask your level?  I suspect you are not 39+ whereby you can res and you haven't experienced what alot of us have.<p>: : My level is not important.  Your protest affects<br>: : me whether I play a cleric, ranger, bard or any<br>: : other character of any race, if you are on the<br>: : same server as me.  Too many corpses in a zone<br>: : drives up lag.  Hence, NPC corpses only hang<br>: : around for 8 minutes as of the last patch.  This<br>: : is to drop the number of corpses in a zone, and<br>: : reduce lag.  Hence a 2-hour res limit.  This is<br>: : to reduce the incidence of people leaving corpses<br>: : lying around for days waiting for a resurrect to<br>: : regain lost XP.  You want to pick apart my argument<br>: : with a meaningless debate over what level I have<br>: : played to.  You ignore the fact:  lag sucks for<br>: : EVERYONE, and YOU are directly contributing to it<br>: : with your suggested protest.  Whether or not I<br>: : can cast resurrect, or if I have to deal with<br>: : people hounding me, and having to respond within<br>: : the 2 hour period, is totally irrelevant.  My<br>: : only point is that corpses create lag.  Go to an<br>: : empty zone sometime and notice how different the<br>: : lag is... even the difference between the newbie<br>: : area in West Freeport (lots of corpses and active<br>: : monsters) and anywhere else in WF is drastic in <br>: : terms of lag.<p>: : : Sometimes it takes 2 hrs just to get near a corpse to drag it back for a res.  2 hrs is simply not enough time.<p>: : That's understandable.  I'm not saying the 2 hour<br>: : limit was the "right" solution.  What I'm saying<br>: : is that this was their first attempt to curb the<br>: : rash of people leaving multiple corpses in hopes<br>: : of a future res.  Voice your protest.  Just don't<br>: : do it in a way that compounds the pre-existing<br>: : problem, because that makes things worse for US,<br>: : the players, not Verant.  So what?  They get a few<br>: : more people complaining about lag?  Big deal!  That<br>: : won't motivate them to do anything.  They've<br>: : already tried to implement something to reduce the<br>: : problem, but people like you take the extreme<br>: : approach of doing EXACTLY what is causing the<br>: : problem in the first place.  How much of a hypocrite<br>: : does it make you, in one hand to cry about how<br>: : people have corpses stacked up all over the place<br>: : and you have to spend so much time running around<br>: : doing resses, but now, you're telling people to<br>: : stack their corpses up?<p>: : : : I personally don't appreciate this approach, no<br>: : : : matter what "statement" you think it makes to<br>: : : : Verant.  It's your fellow players (and yourself)<br>: : : : that suffer from this meaningless protest.  Lots<br>: : : : of corpses lying around is theoretically the main<br>: : : : reason for increasing lag, which is why Verant<br>: : : : made this policy change... to get rid of corpses.<p>: : : And the point is to prove to Verant that it didn't solve it simply because their "fix" solved nothing.<p>: : How would you know?  You haven't given it a chance<br>: : to fix anything.  The patch has been in for two<br>: : days.  Give it time to stabilize, give people a<br>: : chance to adjust to the new situation.  You can't<br>: : just mix things up and expect the water to clear<br>: : up again because you want it to, because it upsets<br>: : your personal little world.<p>: : : : So rather than voice your opinion, you choose to<br>: : : : voice your opinion AND make the game miserable for<br>: : : : me and others.<p>: : : I voice my opion and make a statement.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  You are entitled to do it as well.  If you wanna go the miserable route, isn't it kinda like the same way this change makes the game miserable for me being a cleric?<p>: : Make your statement.  Voice it.  Just don't take<br>: : an action that FORCES me to live with the<br>: : consequences of your lack of judgement.  You can<br>: : petition Verant all you want, adding the symbolic<br>: : gesture of leaving corpses is not going to spur<br>: : them to take action, no matter what you think.<p>: : : : The bottom line is that Verant is not going to<br>: : : : respond positively to this kind of protest.  What<br>: : : : they will listen to is all the /feedback.  Keep<br>: : : : telling people to voice their displeasure, and<br>: : : : Verant will eventually bow to the pressure.  Leave<br>: : : : corpses around, and Verant will just throw their<br>: : : : hands in the air and say "Hey, we tried to fix<br>: : : : the problem but you people don't want to cooperate."<p>: : : When has Verant every responded positively in the first place ?  I'm tired of them "nerfing" one of our best spells because of their own stupid game mechanic.  Alot of times when they make changes they blame the players while never looking in the mirror.<p>: : That's a nice way of dodging the argument.  It's<br>: : always someone else's fault, isn't it?  They, they,<br>: : they.  They did this.  Not me.  Oh woe is me!<p>: : Verant is balancing the game for all PLAYERS.<br>: : Note that I said "players" and not characters, or<br>: : classes, or races.  It is unfair for other people<br>: : to have to endure bad lag due to excessive corpse<br>: : piling in a zone (for whatever reason).  It's also<br>: : unfair to clerics to have a restriction put on one<br>: : of their most powerful spells, and one that is<br>: : arguably the ultimate reason for playing a cleric.<br>: : It's still more unfair to the people that NEED the<br>: : cleric to resurrect them, but can't get someone to<br>: : do it within the time limit.<p>: : T O O   B A D.<p>: : The overriding need is for Verant to make the game<br>: : an enjoyable experience for ALL paying customers.<br>: : My experience is better because of the change if<br>: : it truly reduces lag, despite any loss in benefits<br>: : from things like resurrection.  You simply want<br>: : Verant to kowtow and cater to your personal whim.<br>: : All classes have endured "nerfing" of some kind,<br>: : and there's alway a hue and cry at the outset.<br>: : Eventually, people come to the realization that<br>: : it's just a game, and get on with their lives.<p>: : : : The problem isn't people that leave a corpse in<br>: : : : every zone for a free teleport, it's the people<br>: : : : that leave a DOZEN corpses in one zone.  <p>: : : Why don't they make it so you can only be ressed once?  Beats me.<p>: : What happens when someone resses you to the wrong<br>: : corpse?  Oops, can't res you to the right one, now.<br>: : Sorry.  For that matter, you could ask why you can<br>: : have more than one corpse... Think about it for<br>: : a while.. You're actually trying to RATIONALIZE<br>: : the fact that IN A GAME you can die, and yet you<br>: : are still alive, and can go back to your dead<br>: : body and take all of your possessions from it, and<br>: : then it magically disappears.  This is why it's<br>: : called FANTASY.<p>: : : Consider<br>: : : : it this way... you have to resurrect them before<br>: : : : the body decays beyond a certain point.  In two<br>: : : : hours, the body has decayed enough that the life<br>: : : : force can't enter it again.  If you're not the<br>: : : : roleplay type, this explanation won't satisfy you,<br>: : : : so you'll just have to live with it until you can<br>: : : : get Verant to change it.<p>: : : As far as your lag is concerned, honestly I wouldn't blame the corpses.  Although corpses do contribute to it, its the programmers that should of thought of that when they were programming.  Even in unrest with no corpses its laggy.  Another example of Verant pointing the finger at someone else.<p>: : No, I've been in plenty of zones where corpses<br>: : weren't a problem and haven't had a problem with<br>: : lag.  I've also been in plenty of zones where<br>: : I've seen trails of monster corpses, as well as<br>: : half a dozen of the same person's corpses, and<br>: : could barely move.  Lag has everything to do with<br>: : the number of dynamic objects that are being kept<br>: : track of.  Everything in a zone, or within a<br>: : certain distance or sightline from you, must be<br>: : constantly sent to your computer from the server<br>: : to update it's condition, position and activity.<br>: : The more objects in that zone, the more bits it<br>: : has to pump down the line to your modem, and the<br>: : slower things move as it tries to assimilate the<br>: : data.  That's why the newbie zone in West Freeport<br>: : is so damn slow... a big open area with lots of<br>: : moving objects, and tons of corpses.  I'm lucky to<br>: : get a few frames per second from the E Commons<br>: : zone to just past the West Gate, after which things<br>: : start running smoothly again.  You can't convince<br>: : me otherwise because it's simple, irrefutable<br>: : fact.  As for Verant pointing fingers, or whether<br>: : they should have taken that into account.. there's<br>: : only so much you can do... the only other solution<br>: : is to cut servers off at a certain number of players<br>: : at a time.  Yeah, right... "You can not log on at<br>: : this time because the maximum number of players for<br>: : this server has been reached."  That would go over<br>: : REALLY well with some people.  Lag happens, there's<br>: : no doubt about that.  But that doesn't make it OK<br>: : for you to make it worse with your protest that<br>: : will fall on deaf ears.  Verant isn't going to<br>: : respond to high lag in the game by increasing the<br>: : res time limit, they're going to ignore it.  What<br>: : MIGHT get them to increase the time limit again<br>: : is if they get enough customer feedback from ALL<br>: : classes across ALL servers, complaining about it.<br>: : They've already implemented their solution for<br>: : reducing the lag.  If you want to thwart that plan,<br>: : then they won't take steps to stop you, because<br>: : you're only hurting yourself and other players.<br>: : You're not gaining by it, so why should they be<br>: : concerned?  It's not as if you're exploiting the<br>: : game for your own gain, which I'm sure they<br>: : WOULD put a stop to quickly.  I just don't think<br>: : you understand the corporate mindset on the other<br>: : end of this equation.  They profit any way you look<br>: : at it, so they will try to implement the MINIMUM<br>: : amount of work necessary to fix a problem and keep<br>: : customer satisfaction above a certain threshold.<br>: : They don't do "extra" because that reduces profit.<br>: : So as far as they're concerned, they've done their<br>: : part: they've put into effect a rule that is by<br>: : nature designed to reduce the number of corpses<br>: : lingering.  It effectively does that under normal<br>: : circumstances.  If YOU as a player choose to try<br>: : to circumvent that rule and make corpses linger<br>: : intentionally, then you are making a choice to<br>: : do something which is (to them) stupid, but well<br>: : within your right to do, even though the result<br>: : of that may be harmful to you and others.  You can<br>: : also throw yourself off a high place and kill your<br>: : character if you want, or you can attack mobs that<br>: : are 20 levels more powerful than you.  That is your<br>: : choice.  It hurts you.  In a tangential way, it<br>: : may hurt someone else without their consent...<br>: : you might pull a bunch of high-level monsters to<br>: : a newbie zone, and all of the newbies die.  It's<br>: : not Verant's job to stop you from making those<br>: : decisions (unless they are done with malicious<br>: : intent, in which case it's harassment, and can be<br>: : actionable).  You can make all the bad decisions<br>: : you want, there is no added penalty for stupidity.<br>: : But just as you say you have the right to voice<br>: : your protest, I have the right to tell you that I<br>: : think your protest it harmful to me and the rest<br>: : of the online community.  You'll do what you want<br>: : to do regardless, but at least I've made a positive<br>: : and constructive statement, and you've only whined<br>: : and pouted, and generally made it unpleasant for<br>: : everyone around you.<p>: : This wasn't some kind of personal attack, although<br>: : I think you took it that way.  I'm just trying to<br>: : impress upon you that two wrongs don't make a<br>: : right.  Verant didn't make the right call with<br>: : the two hour limit.  That doesn't mean that it's<br>: : right to suggest that people keep lag high by<br>: : making sure they leave perpetual corpses.  That's<br>: : not going to help solve anyone's problems.<br>: : Sometimes, lashing out isn't as effective as<br>: : communicating in a reasonable fashion.<p>: : Gorgrim<br>: : Servant of Underfoot<br>: : Prelate of the 14th Cloth<br>: : Tarew Marr<p>

: (now gogrim, are you experiencing positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, or punishment? ;)











: : 1.)  Corpses:  Yes there were too many and something had to be done.

: : 2.)  A 2 hr time limit is just not enough time to res someone in alot of cases.  The time it takes to organize people for a romp for a corpse retrieval can take a long time.

: : If it had an 8 hr - 24hr time on it, I would have absolutely no problem with it.  It gave people an adequate time to get ressed.

: : Now the reason for the protest:

: : Verant is using a game mechanic to get rid of some of the lag but at the expense of the clerics most distinquishable spell in the game.  Call it what you will, in the process it is a nerfing of our ressurect line of spells.

: : If you don't give Verant a reason to address an issue, they will just not address it.

: : I will continue to do what I do.  I will res people and ask them to leave a junk item on their corpse if they want to show support for it.  I also ask them to send feedback to Verant as to why they are leaving a naked corpse.

: : :: Sorry you feel that its a meaningless protest when it actually has merit.  May I ask your level?  I suspect you are not 39+ whereby you can res and you haven't experienced what alot of us have.

: : : My level is not important.  Your protest affects

: : : : I voice my opion and make a statement.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  You are entitled to do it as well.  If you wanna go the miserable route, isn't it kinda like the same way this change makes the game miserable for me being a cleric?

: : : Make your statement.  Voice it.  Just don't take

: : : That's a nice way of dodging the argument.  It's
: : : always someone else's fault, isn't it?  They, they,
: : : they.  They did this.  Not me.  Oh woe is me!

: : : Verant is balancing the game for all PLAYERS.
: : : Note that I said &quot;players&quot; and not characters, or
: : : classes, or races.  It is unfair for other people
: : : to have to endure bad lag due to excessive corpse
: : : piling in a zone (for whatever reason).  It's also
: : : unfair to clerics to have a restriction put on one
: : : of their most powerful spells, and one that is
: : : arguably the ultimate reason for playing a cleric.
: : : It's still more unfair to the people that NEED the
: : : cleric to resurrect them, but can't get someone to
: : : do it within the time limit.

: : : T O O   B A D.

: : : The overriding need is for Verant to make the game
: : : an enjoyable experience for ALL paying customers.
: : : My experience is better because of the change if
: : : it truly reduces lag, despite any loss in benefits
: : : from things like resurrection.  You simply want
: : : Verant to kowtow and cater to your personal whim.
: : : All classes have endured &quot;nerfing&quot; of some kind,
: : : and there's alway a hue and cry at the outset.
: : : Eventually, people come to the realization that
: : : it's just a game, and get on with their lives.

: : : : : The problem isn't people that leave a corpse in
: : : : : every zone for a free teleport, it's the people
: : : : : that leave a DOZEN corpses in one zone.  

: : : : Why don't they make it so you can only be ressed once?  Beats me.

: : : What happens when someone resses you to the wrong
: : : corpse?  Oops, can't res you to the right one, now.
: : : Sorry.  For that matter, you could ask why you can
: : : have more than one corpse... Think about it for
: : : a while.. You're actually trying to RATIONALIZE
: : : the fact that IN A GAME you can die, and yet you
: : : are still alive, and can go back to your dead
: : : body and take all of your possessions from it, and
: : : then it magically disappears.  This is why it's
: : : called FANTASY.

: : : : Consider
: : : : : it this way... you have to resurrect them before
: : : : : the body decays beyond a certain point.  In two
: : : : : hours, the body has decayed enough that the life
: : : : : force can't enter it again.  If you're not the
: : : : : roleplay type, this explanation won't satisfy you,
: : : : : so you'll just have to live with it until you can
: : : : : get Verant to change it.

: : : : As far as your lag is concerned, honestly I wouldn't blame the corpses.  Although corpses do contribute to it, its the programmers that should of thought of that when they were programming.  Even in unrest with no corpses its laggy.  Another example of Verant pointing the finger at someone else.

: : : No, I've been in plenty of zones where corpses
: : : weren't a problem and haven't had a problem with
: : : lag.  I've also been in plenty of zones where
: : : I've seen trails of monster corpses, as well as

: : : the number of dynamic objects that are being kept
: : : track of.  Everything in a zone, or within a
: : : certain distance or sightline from you, must be
: : : constantly sent to your computer from the server
: : : to update it's condition, position and activity.
: : : The more objects in that zone, the more bits it
: : : has to pump down the line to your modem, and the
: : : slower things move as it tries to assimilate the
: : : data.  That's why the newbie zone in West Freeport
: : : is so damn slow... a big open area with lots of
: : : moving objects, and tons of corpses.  I'm lucky to
: : : get a few frames per second from the E Commons
: : : zone to just past the West Gate, after which things

: : : they should have taken that into account.. there's
: : : only so much you can do... the only other solution
: : : is to cut servers off at a certain number of players
: : : at a time.  Yeah, right... &quot;You can not log on at
: : : this time because the maximum number of players for
: : : this server has been reached.&quot;  That would go over
: : : REALLY well with some people.  Lag happens, there's
: : : no doubt about that.  But that doesn't make it OK
: : : for you to make it worse with your protest that
: : : will fall on deaf ears.  Verant isn't going to
: : : respond to high lag in the game by increasing the
: : : res time limit, they're going to ignore it.  What
: : : MIGHT get them to increase the time limit again
: : : is if they get enough customer feedback from ALL
: : : classes across ALL servers, complaining about it.
: : : They've already implemented their solution for
: : : reducing the lag.  If you want to thwart that plan,
: : : then they won't take steps to stop you, because
: : : you're only hurting yourself and other players.
: : : You're not gaining by it, so why should they be
: : : concerned?  It's not as if you're exploiting the
: : : game for your own gain, which I'm sure they
: : : WOULD put a stop to quickly.  I just don't think
: : : you understand the corporate mindset on the other
: : : end of this equation.  They profit any way you look
: : : at it, so they will try to implement the MINIMUM
: : : amount of work necessary to fix a problem and keep
: : : customer satisfaction above a certain threshold.
: : : They don't do &quot;extra&quot; because that reduces profit.
: : : So as far as they're concerned, they've done their
: : : part: they've put into effect a rule that is by
: : : nature designed to reduce the number of corpses
: : : lingering.  It effectively does that under normal
: : : circumstances.  If YOU as a player choose to try
: : : to circumvent that rule and make corpses linger
: : : intentionally, then you are making a choice to
: : : do something which is (to them) stupid, but well
: : : within your right to do, even though the result
: : : of that may be harmful to you and others.  You can
: : : also throw yourself off a high place and kill your
: : : character if you want, or you can attack mobs that
: : : are 20 levels more powerful than you.  That is your
: : : choice.  It hurts you.  In a tangential way, it
: : : may hurt someone else without their consent...
: : : you might pull a bunch of high-level monsters to
: : : a newbie zone, and all of the newbies die.  It's
: : : not Verant's job to stop you from making those
: : : decisions (unless they are done with malicious
: : : intent, in which case it's harassment, and can be
: : : actionable).  You can make all the bad decisions
: : : you want, there is no added penalty for stupidity.
: : : But just as you say you have the right to voice
: : : your protest, I have the right to tell you that I
: : : think your protest it harmful to me and the rest
: : : of the online community.  You'll do what you want
: : : to do regardless, but at least I've made a positive
: : : and constructive statement, and you've only whined
: : : and pouted, and generally made it unpleasant for
: : : everyone around you.

: : : This wasn't some kind of personal attack, although
: : : I think you took it that way.  I'm just trying to
: : : impress upon you that two wrongs don't make a
: : : right.  Verant didn't make the right call with
: : : the two hour limit.  That doesn't mean that it's
: : : right to suggest that people keep lag high by
: : : making sure they leave perpetual corpses.  That's
: : : not going to help solve anyone's problems.
: : : Sometimes, lashing out isn't as effective as
: : : communicating in a reasonable fashion.
