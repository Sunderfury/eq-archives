I must have hit a nerve or something. Maybe the reason I found this to be true are some differences in equipment. My cleric has all bronze armor, while my warrior had only banded. My cleric was using Staff of Observers, while the warrior was wielding two Mino Axes. The area where I was comparing the two was an orc tower where three orcs spawned. With my cleric able to take them on one at time using soothe. My warrior was not capable of dispensing all three at once. Of course at that level, the warriors double attack skill was still quite undeveloped. So I guess my situation and the differences in equipment might be the difference, plus my warrior was a dwarf which may not make the best warrior.<p>: Karaf<br>: 19th Order Dwarf Cleric<p>
