...but on several occasions, I've hit the zone or gated just barely alive (I hate to run from a fight;))  Like in Permafrost playing as a ranger, when running from a train, I hit the zone just barely alive, then found myself teleported back to about where the train first hit me.  But I was at full health!  Another instance was as a cleric, running to Highpass, where I had the misfortune to run into Broon.  That time I gated, again just barely alive, but instead of gating back to my bind point, I ended up still on the path to Highpass.  My HP's were low, but still higher than when I gated, but fortunately Broon was nowhere in sight.  I've had a couple of other similar incidents.<p>My best guess is that I actually died while zoning or gating and that the apparent teleportation to another spot with differing HP status is most likely the last point at which my character had been saved.  So I suspect that you actually died just as the evac went off, so it returned you back to your last saved point.  If you had been nowhere near the zone, I have had two instances of finding my corpse in locations far from where I died.  Fortunately, I had a bard with me both times.  One time was in Blackburrow, when I died near the Everfrost zone.  My corpse ended up near the other zone.  Another time was again in Perma (both BB and Perma seem badly bugged!), again running from a train, *sigh*, but although I kept running for the zone, I never hit it - it was like an endless tunnel.  My bard friend located my body behind a wall in Perma, and could even target it but couldn't /corpse it.  Had to wait for a GM on that one :((<p>
