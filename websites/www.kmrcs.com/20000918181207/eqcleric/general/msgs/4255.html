Maybe not...but i know BB is a rare spawn there and drops barnacle shoulders. Either way <br>it a very rare spawn. You probably would have gotten more at the Sat. bazzar (id say 200 minimum). But anyway, congrats on the rare spawn and 105 plat!<br>: I was running thru Dagnar's Cauldron the other day to Unrest<br>: (against my better judgement).  Had SOW so wasn't as concerned<br>: about the Goblins.  Well a skeleton jumped me, Banded Bone I believe<br>: is this correct?  If so can anyone confirm this?<p>: Anyhow he con'd blue to me at 20.  Fortunately i had buffed myself<br>: prior to running just in case of anything.  Well close fight had 2<br>: bubbles of life left when he died.  Well I looted him as he had a bizarre<br>: looking spear.  Turned out to be a Coral Trident 8/38 +5 Dexterity.<br>: Well I thought it was a nice loot, but wasn't sure on it's value.<br>: Got to unrest and auctioned it off for 105pp in 5 mins, not bad...<p>: Unfortunately i was promptly killed by a train after the sale...LOL<br>: But slight loss of experience was worth the money as I didn't lose my level...<p>: Walterscott<p>
