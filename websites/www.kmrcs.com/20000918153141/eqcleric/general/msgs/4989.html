This isn't a Druid vs Cleric thing, its a playability thing.<p>I am (was) a high level effective cleric.  At high levels there isn't this "flocking" of clerics that everyone seems to talk about.  I have read this from my first day I made my cleric.  Now that I'm high level I'm just stating that its just not always the case, in fact its a rarity.<p>What can I say, when I'm on EQ I like to play.  Being a cleric greatly affects playability moreso than any other class, whether grouped or not.<p>:  You seem convinced that Druids have it so much better than Clerics. I won't argue with you one way or the other. Go play a Druid. I sincerely hope that you enjoy your Druidic life...no sarcasm in that either. <p>: You're totally right, druids can solo at all levels and Clerics cannot. Personally I found the Druidic lifestyle boring after ahwile. Groups were not flocking to have me as so many posts here would have people believe.<br>: I've only been playing  Clerics  for a couple months so I'm no expert…but not only have I had no problems finding groups from level 1-17 but strangers beg me to join them to the point that its annoying (much like sow requests are to Druids). <br>:   I'll spare you the "you reap what you sow" speech, but if  you have that much trouble getting into groups as a Cleric maybe something else is wrong.  Hell I took up smithing figuring it would give me something to do if I couldn't find a group and so far I need more time for the darn smithing cause I'm always out fighting too much.<p>:   It's been said a million times, this class is not for everyone, this class is not an easy one to play because of it's lack of soloability.  It's a shame that you spent so much time on the wrong class for you. But before you try to warn off young Clerics, realize that this happens in ALL classes. I spent months on a Druid who sits idle now. You spent months on a Cleric who may go into storage…it's not the class that makes this happen, it's the people trying to learn which class is  right for them.<p><p><br>: : Firstly I'd like to say I started as a wizard and later started a cleric which became my primary character.  Well even before I write this I'm going to say I pretty much have begun to HATE my cleric.  <p>: : Everyone has been telling me, it gets better just hang in there.  Well I've hung in there for months and in fact its gotten worse.<p>: : Well when I started this character, grouping off the bat was next to impossible.    <p>: : Lets be honest about it, low level clerics absolutely suck.  Your abilties are basically matched with those of Shamans and Druids at what clerics are suppose to be the best at:  Healing.  This is one of my primary problems with the class I chose.  Other classes are also "masters" at what your class is devoted to at lower levels.  I think thats a BIG problem.  People have said, well it enhances the group.  Sure it enhances the group, at the compromise of a clerics main ability.  The jist of it is that it cheapens clerics at the one thing they are suppose to be good at.  I don't remember seeing clerics match anyone else at their abilities at the lower levels.<p>: : Honestly, at low levels who would you rather have in your group if you could have only one of these characters; a cleric, a shaman or a druid ?  I could almost guarantee you that it would be a shaman or druid; a more useful utility type player at those levels.<p>: : I use to travel and hour to 2 hours a night trying to find a group at lower levels, and less face it you will need to group at lower levels.  Most of the lower end levels ended up soloing.  Soloing as a cleric is near next to impossible.  We are definately not matched with any class at lower levels on things such as DD (Heck we do 80 damage DD until 29).<p>: : I did find a steady group for about 5 levels, consisting of a monk, druid, shaman, warrior and myself being the cleric.<p>: : During this time I was matched in my prime abilities.  The Druids buffs would overlap mine, and the shaman/druid matched me with greater healing.<p>: : Well eventually I became better and worked hard on my character.  I received my Superior healing spell.  I thought that finally things would change now that my healing abilities are unique.  That just wasn't the case, superior healing is useful but only after level 40.  (This is why everyone is under the impression that clerics shine at 40+).  Another thing that miffed me about clerics is that we have to spend huge costs on buffs that require gems.  Why is this ?  Are we not poor enough already?  The Pinzarn symbol costs anywhere from 8go to 1pp per cast, and Naltron symbol I believe costs 9pp to 11pp per cast.  Well we are suppose to be good at buffing, but if we want to do it we have to pay through the nose.  Why couldn't they do this the same way many druid spells work?  For instance, if you want to use the flame lick spell (A level 1 druid spell) you simply have to have a fire beetle eye in your inventory and it never goes away and you can cast that spell an unlimited amount of time as long as you have the fire beetle eye in your inventory.  Why can't clerics simply have an infinte gem per each symbol that doesn't go away?  If you want to be a cleric who can buff, you are going to have to pay through the nose.  I myself can't even upgrade my jewelry because I can't even afford it because of the buffing  --and yes buffing is important.  Apparently we are supposed to have the best buffs in the game, but if we want to be the best we have to pay for it.<p>: : ...Well you are high level now...you say to yourself, great, everyone needs a cleric!<p>: : The reality is you will find it even HARDER to group at higher levels than at the lower ones.  There are essentially 2 places you can play at higher levels.  Guk and SolB.  That is where all the high level clerics are, and they are always in surplus.
