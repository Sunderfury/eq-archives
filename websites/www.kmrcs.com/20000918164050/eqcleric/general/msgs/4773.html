: My friend Nevar and I have combed Kithicor Forest and have not found the icon or whatever it is. (forgive me i'm a troll)  Do you know which burned out house has the thing?  It seems like Smokey the Bear needs to hang out in this zone more.  The 6-12 hour respawn rate is a pain considering it doesn't sound too special so far.<p>You'll find the diary of Turgan the Reliant in a burned out cabin close to the zone border between Rivervale and West Commons.  I think you have to give this diary to Turgan when you find him in Lake Rathetear; not sure.  The Ingot of the Reliant is found on top of a tree stump at loc -89, 3269; you have to jump to the stump from a fallen tree.<br>
