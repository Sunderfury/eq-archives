Found it...<p>From www.graffe.com<br>-----------------------------------------------<br>This from Nezzar Enkahmin of Rodcet Nife :<br>"Greetings, I am emailing to let you inform players of the<br>possibility of the Specialization Removal Quest being inop. My<br>character's name is Nezzar, I play on the Rodcet Nife server,<br>and am a level 31 wizard. I followed the quest, giving the ruby<br>to Ostorm like he had asked. He then said that my<br>specialization is now at 49 and I got faction adjustments 415<br>and 416. He then asked for the 50 gold pieces I owed him. I<br>paid him and went on my way. Went to guild, tried to train in<br>it, but it said that it was maxed. While fighting, during a med<br>period, glanced at my skill levels and noticed that my<br>abjuration was average while my evocation was at below<br>average. The skills were not reset. Now, the only thing I can<br>think of is the possibility of the 50 gold pieces being to nullify<br>this effect. I am not sure of this, the 50 gold pieces were in<br>brackets, but only after doing the quest, giving him the ruby, I<br>was in a conversation with another at that time and lost the<br>NPC talk so I could not bring up that dialogue with the NPC<br>Ostorm. If anyone out there is going to do this quest, have<br>them ask about the gold pieces and what they are for before<br>they pay for it. It may be that it cancels the effect. Warn the<br>others. I have submitted a feedback after I noticed it, (I had<br>done a petition, but the 2 GM's online got off line before<br>answering my petition), and I am waiting on an email from<br>Verant if they respond. Thank you"<br>-----------------------------------------------
