: I posted a similar question on another board before I found this one.  Please don't consider it spamming - I think I just have a better chance of good advice here.

: Beello has full banded, a savant's cap, SSoL, and a few mana increasing rings and earings.  He also has 140 pp in the bank and prospects of raising an additional 20-30 by the time he needs to buy his level 14 spells.  Of course this raises opportunity of spending 100+ on something.

: Beello has solo'ed his whole life, but will now begin grouping in a support roll, so I think additional/different weapons are not a high priority.

: Mana increasing, either directly or through wisdom increasing, seems like a good idea.  I saw Z's Coronet auctioned for ~125pp last week, more than I had at the time.  Is this a good idea?  Where does it come from - maybe I would have a better shot at buying it in that zone.  

: Any other ideas?  BTW, if anyone knows of Mithanial Marr guilds with mature people who play for fun, I would like to hear about them.  Thanks for all the help, and congratulations on a great site!
