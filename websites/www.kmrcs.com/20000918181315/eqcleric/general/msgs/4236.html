Last night, was hunting Dervs within a full group in N. Ro. I had so much lag that every message was coming 2 to 10 seconds after been sent so I made a lot of mistakes (try to understand what is happening when medding and when your only link with the "outside world" is so sloooowwww).<br>So I did apologize when I arrived late in the battle a couple of fight. And the leader of the group, a warrior, said "Doesn't matter. Thank you for keeping me alive". <br>Ah ! Never felt as good as a cleric.<br>
