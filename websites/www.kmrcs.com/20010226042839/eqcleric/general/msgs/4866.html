I don't know for certain (i'm not lvl 45+ yet, and i'll bet most of the DE's who bitch about this all the time are not either) but i've heard that it is simply a typo on the graphic.  The PoF armor is wearable by ALL races that can be clerics.  I HAVE seen a dark elf wearing etherial mist armor (but it may have been someone in the guise so i'm not completely sure).  Also, before you continue complaining about DE's getting the shaft on all cleric quests just take a look at where the new cleric armor quests are going.. the temple of sul ro.. practically right next store to your home town!  so i'll just try to forget about how many posts i've read from DE's bitching about some stupid hammer or a misprint in the PoF armor when i'm trying to tiptoe through nektulos because i'm KoS by all the damned dragoons.  But i suppose you won't be happy until there is a DE only +100 wis super weapon available from neriak for turning in 3 snake skins.  ah well, if you ever get the PoF armor you'll probably realize that this entire topic was moot to begin with.<p><br>: Why in the name of (fill in your deity here) were Halflings, Gnomes, and Dark Elf clerics exempt from being able to wear the Plane of Fear Armor?  I realize there are not a lot of us out there compared to you Dwarves and High Elves, but explain to me the reasoning for us being shafted on the best Cleric armor in the game??????   If I would have know this when I created my character, I might have chosen a different race.  Why is it Verant never has the balls to give a popular race/class the shaft?  If certain races are to be exempt, at least give me a decent story-line or justification for this.  Jesus.  What a bunch of BS!!!!!!<p>
