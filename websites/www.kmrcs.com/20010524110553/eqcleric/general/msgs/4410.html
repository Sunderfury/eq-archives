If I had a Staff of the observers and didn't have the shield, I'd make the trade in a heartbeat. <p>Most ppl farm the Observers staff and you can easily buy one for about 300-400 platinum at bazaars. <p>And once you equip the +9 wisdom shield, you'll never go back. My observers staff has a permanent place in my vault now. Ill never use it again, but Im a pack rat.<p>Psomm, the Mentalist... only 20 bubbles from 50! (hehe)<p>
