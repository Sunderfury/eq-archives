Yes, family does create quite a distraction.  Here's what I do, wait until my spouse crashes, & then play for a few hours.  The kids are usually in bed, so I end up w/ a good chunk of "ME ONLY" time. <p>We've also got 2 accounts, so my kids play too.<p>I'll be tempted to at least look for quest items when ever I'm near one of the spawns.  While, I'm not convinced of it's worth, as we've not seen all the stats yet.  I'm wearing bronze gauntlets, legs, & boots. Barbed Arms, Thick Leather Apron, BS Tunic, 2 PBB's, a savants cap, & a black iron medallion, & crested spaulders. (I know someone, who's supposedly getting me a set of Adamantite Spaulders, we'll see)<p>I do know this.  The boots & gauntlets we've seen are both better then thier bronze/plate equivalent, & are just below Rubicite.  <p>The stats on my BS tunic are AC13 +4 wis + 4 agi.   If this trend continues, that'll mean the tunic is likely AC 18.  <p>My bronze boots are ac8, & weigh a ton.  Quest boots are ac9 AND +5 agi.  I'd like to dodge better, so I'm ok with this.  <p>My gauntlets are AC9, & weigh a ton.  Quest Gloves are AC10 & +6 Disease?  These don't have me all wound up, but they ARE better than what I've got...<p>I can't imagine they'd give us this armor w/o increasing wisdom on at least one of the items.<br>I'm anxious to see the bracers.   The AC on Polished Bone Braclets are poor, but give good wis/int adjustments, so I bite the bullet & loose more AC on my wrists, too.  I'm loosing AC on my neck, my check, my wrists & my skull,, all for the sake of wisdom.   <p>Enuf for now, but I do think I'll try to find the boots first.<p>Tomma Trueheart<br>Priestess of Mithaniel Marr, 24L<br>Kel'Daoine
