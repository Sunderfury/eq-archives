I think I went from my upper teens through the low twenties in Unrest.  It does have a learning curve, but as I gained in levels, it also got to be more fun.  I started out with the yard trash and moved into pulling from the first floor.  Then it was pulling from the second floor.  And for a while I would camp the basement.  I have had deaths at each of those major milestones, but it didn't deter me.  <p>I wouldn't shun a zone because of a quick death.  Try it out for a few hours and then shun it. =)<p>~ren
