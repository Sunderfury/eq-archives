Ok I have been sitting at the botton of the river here for some time waiting to see this mysterious ingot.  I decided that I was tired of waiting so I logged, and logged on every hour or so and I have yet to see it.  Anyone know what kind of time is on this Ingot spawn or has the loc been changed?<p>Sparky<p>: on river bottom at 2996, -5711<p>
