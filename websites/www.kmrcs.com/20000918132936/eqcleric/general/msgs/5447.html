Hi,<br>cant you see what Verent have done? We have been training all our lives from level 8 when we first got meditate for this moment.  Cant you remember back to all the times when you just sat through battles stairing at the book?  You should embrace the 6hr camp as the ultimate cleric challenge. At least we get to stair at something new (tree stump/water column etc..) instead of the damn book, theres only so many perimitations of spell orders that are possible after all.<p>I say double the time and make all the items needed spawn in all the boring, no visit zones. Also put them in night zones (like kithkor) so that even though you have the novelty of being able to see stuff whilst just sitting there, you cant actually see anything because its to damn dark.<p>hehehe.<p>: I'd rather run around killing newbie animals for faction than sitting at some EMPTY STUMP WAITING FOR A BAG TO SPAWN, or SIT IN A LOW LEVEL ZONE WAITING FOR SOME OTHER BAG TO SPAWN!<p>: At least they get to kill something, or at least do some good while they're at it. We just have to sit there in complete boredom just looking at empty places!!!<p>: AHHH!!!!!!!!!! I can't stand even THINKING about this anymore!!!!!!!!<p>: /patz<p>

: Hi,
: cant you see what Verent have done? We have been training all our lives from level 8 when we first got meditate for this moment.  Cant you remember back to all the times when you just sat through battles stairing at the book?  You should embrace the 6hr camp as the ultimate cleric challenge. At least we get to stair at something new (tree stump/water column etc..) instead of the damn book, theres only so many perimitations of spell orders that are possible after all.

: I say double the time and make all the items needed spawn in all the boring, no visit zones. Also put them in night zones (like kithkor) so that even though you have the novelty of being able to see stuff whilst just sitting there, you cant actually see anything because its to damn dark.

: hehehe.

: : I'd rather run around killing newbie animals for faction than sitting at some EMPTY STUMP WAITING FOR A BAG TO SPAWN, or SIT IN A LOW LEVEL ZONE WAITING FOR SOME OTHER BAG TO SPAWN!

: : At least they get to kill something, or at least do some good while they're at it. We just have to sit there in complete boredom just looking at empty places!!!

: : AHHH!!!!!!!!!! I can't stand even THINKING about this anymore!!!!!!!!
