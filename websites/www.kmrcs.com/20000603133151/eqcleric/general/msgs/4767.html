News sites such as EQVault keep people informed on happenings. The pics are from the test server. The test server is a special server that is set up so that Verant can test changes they want to implement on the rest of the servers. The Temple of Sol Ro will be patched in this wednesday to the rest of the servers according to the most recent test server messages. No you can't accumulate the items on regular servers yet because the items are implemented yet, they will be put in on wednesday along with the zone. Entrance will be located in the Lavastorm mountains zone (Same zone that has entrance to SolA and B). The Lavastorm mountain entrance is gotten to via the Nektulos Forest (Dark Elf area, so be careful since you will be Killed On Site unless you are a DE cleric). Hope that answered some of your questions.  <p><br>- Midan Soulkeeper<br>- Mithanial Marr<p><br>: My question is very simple and straightforward, and im sure i speak for a good majority of the clerics out there. Where do you get ALL this info from. I dont even know what zone this temple is in. I thought all of this stuff was going to be implemented in the expansion, but now im seeing it in pictures, so sombody must have it. Are these pictures from Beta? Can we begin to accumulate items now for when these quest are implemented or are all these quest already available? If i can start them now, how do i get to this Temple? I'm sorry, i know i said 1 question, but all is related, and I think others out there might want to know.<p>: Badmer Gravelight<br>: Tarew Marr<p>
