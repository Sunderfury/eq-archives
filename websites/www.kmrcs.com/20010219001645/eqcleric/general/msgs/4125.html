I came on the second part of this quest so some of my info is not gained first hand.<br>First, Behemoth (a 50th level warrior (or close to it)) received the hammer. He and his group was in the Cauldron and were fixing to do a little exploring in Kedge Keep. They ran across an injured monk. This is where the quest began, and since he was the only dwarf in the party he was already "preordained" by the GMs to get hammer.<br>Not sure on the details here but the party was sent to Kaladim and met up with 2 GM controlled NPC (Fenric being the main one). They then returned to the cauldron. This is where i met up with them. We decended into the water and fought some weird wizard creature that was summoning all kinds of aqua goblins (i looted a fishbone earring off one of them, i think an aqua goblin guardian)<br>We then retreated to the entrace of the cauldron where several DE NPCs arrived. After they killed everyone (well cept me. i invuled each time they attacked me and ran up the sides to lose them....hehe), Fenric came back and said that the DEs had a dwarven relic and were off to CB so they can gate from there to Nek. So we all rallied at CB along with 140+ additional people (can we say super lag?).<br>We killed the DEs and Grak Crushbone and returned the chest back to Kaladim. There the King proclaimed Behemoth the champion of kaladim and said that a key was needed off a DE in Nek forest to open the chest. They killed the De and  got the key then got the hammer.
