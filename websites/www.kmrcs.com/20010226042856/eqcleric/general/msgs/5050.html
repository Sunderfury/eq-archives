I am not sure if you have traveled in a party with two clerics, but you will live longer. My regular hunting party is a level 50 wizard, monk, magician, 2 clerics and a level 49 ranger. Having two clerics is great for reducing down time between battles, living through near impossible battles and that lil extra firepower in a battle when you might want it.<p>We use 2 clerics for mana replacement on down times (heals with manastones) and our party seems to be the least beat up in multiparty battles. When one of our mages needs a lil mana for one last nuke in the middle of a combat the cleric can provide it.<p>Ever see a Ghoul Lord or Froglok King stand, not fighting back, and just die in a combat? With as many as 10 stuns available (2 wizard and 2x4 clerical) in a combat, UberMoBs just wait the battle out till the die. (Ususally for UberMobs the clerics only have 3 stuns up, each.<p>As for there being too many clerics in the high level dungeons, I don't think that is the case atleast for our server (Like Lucretia pointed out). Every big multi group hunt we go on, groups try to steal one of our clerics. I you have a high level cleric, move it to bristlebane (Just don't take our Plane of Fear armor) ;) heheh j/k.<p>Have a GREAT day,<br>Caliphe<br>PS. before I get posts, yes I realize you can not move characters between servers ;).<p>
