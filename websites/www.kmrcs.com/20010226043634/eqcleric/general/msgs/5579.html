You know... when I was asking for advice on how to play my Cleric, it would've been helpful had someone told me to avoid the Qeynos area.  That's whee I've been playing for the last four months and as I've said, it's taken my THAT long to make it to Level Six.  <p>I had NO idea RiverVale was the ideal area for Clerics.  Again... it would've been nice if someone had givem me this piece of advice...<p>Question is now:  HOW the hell do I get there?  I get lost around Qeynos and I've been here for months!!  :)
