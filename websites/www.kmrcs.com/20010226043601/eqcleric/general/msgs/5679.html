Yeah, the armor isn't too great stat wise, and I must admit the weight was a bit disappointing.<p>The nice thing about it (for those of us on PVP) is it's no drop, which means it can't be looted in battles. <p>But after thinking about it, I'm not sure the armor has too much of a purpose outside of PVP. It's not like no drop stuff is useful to people on blue servers, and resistances are nearly worthless too. Having the extra resist that many of the pieces provide is a very nice feature for PVP. <p>Selphie - Circle Noir<br>Tallon Zek<br>
