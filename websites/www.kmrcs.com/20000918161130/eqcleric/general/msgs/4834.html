You really need a cleric with more wisdom to test properly say 220 maybe. Cast either ressurects or complete heals to get down fast and where fizzles are less often. Buy have a decent range of spell in your other slots you can cast these and get an accurate reading of your mana. You dont have to include specialization because you will be casting the same spells with 220 wis as you did with 200. You should be able to see the difference between 10 mana and 50 or so. Dont really need to be exact. <p><br>: I have read *general* comments from Brad that stats above 200 were not as important as getting other stats up. For instance having 250 wisdom was not as beneficial as having 200 wisdom and spreading the other 50 points to other stats. I don't recall ever seeing the specific example of only getting 1 point of mana per 1 stat point after 200. I can tell you that even though I have equipment to max out at 204 wis, the only time I ever wear it all is to show someone what it looks like :) Depending on what I am doing (in group with some tanking, in group with no tanking, travelling/solo, jewelcrafting, practicing skills, buying/selling), I switch off many items. Even with my tanking gear on I have 187 wis so that's basically only 1 spell difference than being maxed out. <p>: My most important piece of advice to clerics who ask me is this. Have fun and be a good cleric. You will make friends and enjoy the game if you learn to fight well - this means taking a leadership roll in many cases. Any smart group would prefer to have a good cleric with 120 wis instead of a bad cleric with 200 wis. So do try to get wis items, but don't panic if you feel underdressed. Concentrate on becoming a great cleric and you will enjoy this game as much as (or more than) any other class.<p>: Raanyar<p><br>: : I have 204 when maxed so I could test this, but how would I know how much mana I have?<br>: : If I just cast a certain spell over and over til empty I still have to deal with fizzles, mana regen and specialization.
