Have you ever been charmed or feared or something similiar?  All it takes is one charm, you attacking Giant or Spectre or Griffin or anything else that is red and your game is over.  Sure you may beat him down to a paulp, but he will win in the end and you will become a greasy spot.<p><p><br>: Resist one spell, break one root etc, you are dead...<p>: You pet can attack all he wants.. I just have to beat you for one min and your cute little hps are all used up.<p>: Man talk about a jerk... you would stand little chance against a well equipped warrior..<p><br>
