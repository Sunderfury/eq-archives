          </span>I work at Verant Interactive as one of the Game Designers for
          EverQuest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have worked
          on all parts of EverQuest – Economy, Items, Quests, Population, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>My domain (each Game Designer generally has a domain that they
          are responsible for) is the Magic system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>This means that I spend a disproportionate amount of my time
          working with the Magic system – though I still have many other
          duties as well.</p>

          aspect of this job – it is my job to be creative every day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>This isn’t always as easy as it sounds, but it is a lot of
          fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I really enjoy what
          I do.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Least favorite –
          well, anything you do long enough becomes work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>And this is definitely work – we put in a lot of hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:

          </span>What was your vision for the cleric class and what we would
          mean to a group?<o:p>

          </b></p>
          </o:p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">The Cleric has always
          been the armored healer, able to travel the world doing the will of
          her deity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While not as
          combat oriented as the Paladin, her spells are an order of magnitude
          both more powerful and versatile. Clerics are a very well rounded
          class – they wield a good variety of magic, can wear plate armor
          (best of any caster in the game) and have decently good HP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>They have excellent Healing spells, Cures, Undead &amp;
          Summoned Warding, Resurrect, Stun, Root, Fear, Pacify and AC &amp; HP
          &amp; Resistance Buffs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;</p>

tab-stops:list .25in"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">4.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why
          would one play a cleric when druids and shaman are so much more
          diverse in addition to healing nearly as well?<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </b></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Druids and Shamans
          don’t heal nearly as well as the Cleric does – at least, not past
          mid levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At low levels
          Clerics, Druids and Shamans all heal similar amounts of HP – the
          Cleric’s bonus is that she heals about 15% more HP the other two
          Priest classes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
          Cleric’s advantage is also that she gets her Healing spells sooner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Past mid-level, the Cleric gets Superior Healing and Complete
          Healing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This leaves the
          Druid and Shaman far behind on the healing curve – there is no class
          in EQ better suited to Healing than the Cleric.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Druids and Shamans have
          different areas where they are strong – but against the Cleric’s
          specialty, nobody comes close.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;

          </span>Will religion ever play a bigger role in our spellcasting
          abilities?<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </b></p>
          </o:p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Probably not in this
          incarnation of EverQuest.</p>

          </span>I think that generally most Clerics are pretty happy until they
          get to higher levels where our life is one of
          med/heal/med/heal/med/buff/med/ress/med/heal etc… does Verant have
          any future plans to help make clerics more exciting to play?<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </b></p>
          </o:p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">This is one of the
          problems with being the best healer in the EQ – people want you to
          heal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We tried a lot of
          stuff in Beta to try to get around this problem (and I had good Beta
          testers – thanks guys!), but it came down to the player perception
          that if you were THE best healer class, you should be healing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Clerics have very respectable Direct Damage, Great Defensive
          Buffs, Great Anti-Undead spells, Resurrect, Pacify, Stun, Root, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">But people want them to
          heal.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Now personally, I
          adhere to the theory that a well played high level Cleric can do
          things other then heal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Stun
          and Root are both good in combat – as is a Mace (extra damage never
          hurts, and most monsters don’t go after the Cleric for swinging her
          mace every once in a while).<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, a lot of players feel that if a Cleric isn’t
          meditating through combat, she is not doing their job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>We have heard suggestions that we shouldn’t let Clerics
          meditate while there is a fight nearby, or make monsters run across
          the room to strike a meditating caster (“so that my party won’t
          make me meditate during combat”).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </span>We don’t, however, want to mandate that Clerics adhere to a
          certain style of play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Clerics
          have the option to or not to meditate during combat right.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">What we can not do is
          up the rate at which mana comes back during mediation, nor can we
          reduce the cost of healing spells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>These things were balanced during Beta and will not be changing
          – they work very well.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">So, in short, no – we
          don’t have immediate plans for this.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1;

          </span>You must have heard this one by now, but why are we able to be
          stunned while divine aura is up and will this ever be changed?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Divine Aura protects
          from physical damage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
          does not protect from stun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
          goes along with our philosophy of having no “get-out-of-jail-free”
          cards in EQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Divine Aura
          is a nice way to protect yourself if things get bad – and as an
          added bonus, monsters tend to leave you alone once they figure out
          that they can’t hit you.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>There is, however, a built in weakness – you can be
          stunned.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;</p>

          </span>The resurrect line of spells was recently changed again that
          has had a major impact on clerics in addition to the lowering of lost
          experience before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now we
          must resurrect a person, and then spend even more mana healing them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>This basically means that a cleric has to sit and med an
          extremely long time when they resurrect anyone, why was this done and
          will we get any type of compensation for this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </b></p>
          </o:p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">We change spells (and
          other things) when we find that they are broken, or being used in ways
          that we think unbalanced the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Occasionally we change things because the players are using
          them in ways that we do not want in our game.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Let me give an example
          from Beta. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>During Beta,
          running moved you pretty fast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
          you jumped while you ran, it gave you a tiny forward boost – a
          running jump.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>This took no additional endurance.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>After a while, ever player was jumping all the time (a.k.a.
          the jump-run).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People
          jump-ran through the cities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>People
          jump-ran through the countryside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>People jump-ran through dungeons.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">It looked pretty silly.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">So we held a meeting,
          and decided that we were going to fix this by making jumping take some
          endurance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That way, a
          person would only be able to jump a few times before having to stop
          and rest.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>When we put this in the Beta testers hated it – they were
          used to the tiny boost in speed, and used to being able to outrun
          monsters by jump-running away from them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>An unintentional bit of code had become a feature.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Now, because this was
          Beta, we had no problem with adjusting the style of play that the Beta
          Testers had gotten used to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
          we hadn’t done this, today you would see bouncing players running
          through every city – and I’m pretty sure everybody would agree
          this would look very silly.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">This is a good example
          of players doing something in EQ that we did not intend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>We fixed it, leaving a more visually pleasing game.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Now, the reason that we
          fixed Resurrect was that people were using it to Kamikaze certain
          types of mobs – usually Dragons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>A big party would attack a Dragon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Anybody who died would get Resurrected, putting them
          immediately into the fight again at full health and full mana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Magi types would mana dump and then get the Dragon to kill them
          so that they could come back with full mana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Warrior types would streak the Dragon and come back with full
          HP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no fear of
          death, and players could with win without tactics – as long as there
          were Clerics, players could throw bodies at big monsters indefinitely
          until the monster finally died from overgorging on player bodies.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">That was pretty silly
          too.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">So we made it that
          players come back in with less HP and less Mana.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

          gets a new DD spell at every rank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>This, in conjunction with her better mana to damage ratio,
          makes her a very solid DD caster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Giving every class DD at every level makes all classes more
          like Wizards – something we are trying to avoid.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Each of our seven primary spell casting classes has a distinct
          flavor and style of play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
          don’t play a Cleric the same way that you would play an Enchanter or
          a Wizard.</p>

          time window appears and the player is hit or interrupted yet it does
          not say so and the spell continues on but doesn’t go off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">This is part of the
          spell design – it is a disadvantage of being knocked out of casting.<span style="mso-spacerun:

          you can’t cast a spell for the rest of the round.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

          of people using these spells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
          are a great pre-combat spell, and they add a lot to the ability of a
          low level to solo.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">The Pacify series makes
          it so that the monster (for the duration of the spell) will not
          respond to calls for help or initiate combat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>If the monster is already in combat, this spell will have no
          effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:

          them and then attack the third.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Parties
          love this spell – they can all group up on one monster and kill it
          quickly without taking the damage from the other two.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">At higher levels, like
          the Atone spell, monsters get a better save verses this effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>This was done because of how powerful the spell turned out to
          be during Beta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At mid to
          high levels, you probably shouldn’t be casting it if you can’t
          take everything in the group – but the 50 to 70% of the time that it
          works, you can take one to two monsters out of a three monster combat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

          always a desirable thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
          a class not receiving attention is better.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">That being said, I
          tweak spells to help maintain the balance of the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>This is a dynamic world and an evolving game – if a certain
          class seems underpowered or too powerful, they get looked at.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>Only if we feel that it would positively effect the game do
          things get changed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">A good example would be
          the change a month or two ago in DoT (Damage over Time) spells.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp; </span>Across the board DoT spells had their duration lowered and
          their damage upped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
          addressed the issue with Druids, Shamans and Necromancers not casting
          their DoT spells in group combat situations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>With the change, DoT spells did much more damage in a shorter
          period of time, meaning that it was advantageous to cast a DoT spell
          at the beginning of combat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Before
          this, when a poison spell would take two minutes to deal its full
          damage (as opposed to the 40 or so seconds now), the creature would
          often die before the full damage was dealt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Now, there is a good chance that the creature will take the
          full damage from the spell.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">This makes it more
          useful.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">The DoT changes have
          had a very beneficial impacts on the game (especially now that we have
          fixed the DoT corpse disappearing bug).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>It made the classes that cast them into better party classes
          – more of their spells could be used in a party situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>This was particularly beneficial for the Necromancer, who at
          release was not overly situated towards a group situation.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">Back to Clerics -
          Clerics have always been fairly well balanced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>The two changes you noted both were specific cases.<span style="mso-spacerun: 
yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">In the Resurrect case,
          the Cleric was not really hurt because no other class can cast
          Resurrect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
          never in competition with another class for this ability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>If we had lowered the Clerics ability to heal (without lowering
          the abilities of other classes to heal) then the Cleric would have
          been hurt – something that they were good at had been lowered in
          relation to how well other classes did it.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">In the case of
          Retribution, there was a data error – a 7 had been entered instead
          of a 1 in one slot of my spell database.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Because of that, Clerics had a better mana to damage ratio with
          Retribution then any other class had with Direct Damage spells.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>Now, Clerics are good at many things, but they have never been
          known for their ability to sling Direct Damage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>This error was found it was corrected – the same way it would
          have been for any other class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Leaving
          Clerics with better DD at high levels would have made them too
          powerful in relation to other classes – something we try to avoid
          whenever possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All
          classes are balanced against each other – we don’t want any one
          class to be the “uber” class.</p>
          <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:.25in">I am looking at a few
          things to add to the Cleric.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
          am not sure if we will add them any time soon – most classes are
          considered “done” as far as their spell selection is involved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
          </span>But we will continue to tweak if we find errors or
