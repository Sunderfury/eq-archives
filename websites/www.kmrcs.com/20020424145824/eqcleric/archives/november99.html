          <blockquote>
            <p>I received a number of e-mails about this (from Pirmin and the
            admins here) and read that <i>really long thread</i> (47 as of the
            last count) and I'm still on the bubble about this.&nbsp; One one
            hand, our quests, well, suck.&nbsp; And the items aren't all that
            special.&nbsp; On the other hand one doesn't have to do them and the
            Paladins, from what I've read, have it much worse anyway (become a
            smith? dain bramaged).&nbsp; Also, keep in mind that not every class
            has quests that are all that special.&nbsp; My wizard friend has
            done two of them and has absolutely zero interest in obtaining any
            of the other quest items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Generally, sitting around some zone on a server I don't play on
            does nothing for my enjoyment factor, nor for the enjoyment of
            anyone else.&nbsp; I prefer to gripe during my non-gaming hours.&nbsp;
            Some of my friends have limited opportunities to play and the
            scheduled date conflicts with one of those opportunities (Friday
            night is group night).&nbsp; I agree that the issue is important,
            but feel that this might be accomplished another way.&nbsp; If it
            does go forward, I of course hope it proves successful.</p>
            <p>That being said, there are three things I'd like to see for our
            quests:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Eliminate all the <i>StumpWatch</i> items (i.e. ground spawns)
                and rare spawns (e.g. Babbinsbort and Gull, what a joke).&nbsp;
                Instead, move our icons and ingots to normal mobs of a certain
                type just as the Ranger and Warrior quests (of which I have been
                in on almost every item for both classes, twice for the
                Rangers).&nbsp; For example, instead of the ground spawns in
                Kithicor, move the Ingot and Icon to Undead Clerics or Healers
                in Kith.&nbsp; For the Caduceus quest, why not force us to kill
                the Undead Will Sappers in the jail cells instead of having us
                hope to pick up a ground spawn?&nbsp; And stop worrying about
                the times Verant.&nbsp; I could realistically complete two or
                more Ranger quests in the time I &quot;might&quot; complete one
                Cleric quest (assuming, of course, that I can get to camp the
                items first).&nbsp; The rare spawns are frankly a joke.&nbsp;
                I've been in on numerous Grimfeather kills, but have only seen
                Regis once and I look every day (I sometimes have to detour
                around Grim on the way to the Zahal and Regis areas).&nbsp; I
                only now realize how lucky I was at the time.</li>
              <li>Increase the AC of our items to be at least on par with the
                Ranger and Shaman armor.&nbsp; Come on Verant, we can wear
                plate, they can't, so one would think we should have better AC
                than chain classes, not worse.&nbsp; Sure, we can wear different
                items, but so what?&nbsp; You give us quest armor and then make
                it relatively undesirable.&nbsp; That's just wierd.</li>
              <li>And, of course, our quests should yield experience.&nbsp; I
                have done both a bracer and the Caduceus, nothing.&nbsp; I got a
                nice little bump at 37 when the ranger forgot to disband when
                completing the greaves.&nbsp; Again, it must be a mistake, but
                it deserves correction.</li>
            </ol>

          <p><b><font color="#804040">Let's talk about customer relations</font></b></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>By now, most of you should be aware of a recent change to the
            Feign Death skill/spell, shared by Monks, Necromancers, and
            Shadowknights.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yesterday afternoon I saw many posts
            complaining that Verant <i>nerf</i>ed FD.&nbsp; I un-subscribed from
            EQ Monks many months ago (just not my favorite class) so it was
            rather surprising to see these posts.&nbsp; According to the many
            reports, FD was nerfed and there are many irate Monks out there (I
            have yet to check how Necro's and SK's feel about this).&nbsp;
            Finally, when I logged on last night, I read Verant's rather
            detailed explanation of the changes and the effects they have on the
            FD skill (for the record many monks disagree with many of the
            points).</p>
            <p>My complaint is this: why wasn't this announced Tuesday with the
            rest of the patch information?&nbsp; There seems to be a trend of
            late when it comes to patches:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Verify that Verant made the changes they say they did.</li>
              <li>Discover new changes (typically <i>nerfs</i> of some sort)
                that were not announced.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This is a disturbing trend and one they must cease immediately.&nbsp;
            Any time they make a change <b>announce it</b>.&nbsp; Players <b>hate</b>
            to log in and discover negative changes that were slipstreamed into
            the game.&nbsp; I for one do not like to discover that certain
            skills or abilities were <i>nerf</i>ed for any class.&nbsp; It makes
            me feel that the company is sneaky, and frankly I had enough of that
            with a previous popular online game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Players are going to complain regardless, but when they have the
            added fuel of discovering a hidden change, they typically go
            ballistic with moral indignation.&nbsp; Kind of hard to blame them.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><b><font color="#804040">On the other hand, I really enjoy the game</font></b></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>And have been very happy with many of the recent changes (e.g.
            Kithicor, Kedge Keep).&nbsp; The re-tuning of Paw, one of my
            favorite dungeons, has me ecstatic.&nbsp; I just hope they get it
            done before I out level it (well, no real danger there).&nbsp; We
            complained about a lack of class-specific items; they added a slew
            of them.&nbsp; The fact that some of the class/race restrictions
            lists are buggy is a somewhat minor point (actually rather
            humorous).&nbsp; The only thing that I would like to see them change
            at this moment would be to restrict the higher level mobs to one
            side of the main path through Kithicor (preferably the side opposite
            Rivervale).&nbsp; I don't think travel through the zone should be
            totally safe for low level characters, but right now it is extremely
            dangerous, perhaps overly dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Verant deserves a big thank you from us, the players.&nbsp; Look
            at what they have done to the zones in the last few weeks:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Kedge Keep is worthwhile with great drops</li>
              <li>Kithicor Forest (it's back now as of yesterday's patch)</li>
              <li>Plane of Hate</li>
              <li>Plane of Fear (well, based upon all the reports must be more
                accessible; it's getting visited regularly now)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Also, they have recently added many, many class specific items.&nbsp;
            I remember writing a few months ago that the options for 35+
            characters were SolB and LGuk; obviously that is no longer the case.</p>
            <p>Thank you Verant for breathing new life into the game!</p>

            Don't let yesterday's comments about the armor get you overwrought,
            it isn't worth it.&nbsp; I personally am not enamored of the armor,
            although I would like a set of the bracers (yes, they are better
            than the Chipped Bone I currently possess).&nbsp; No, I don't plan
            on camping hard for them.&nbsp; I wish all the quests were similar
            to the Caduceus quest (took me maybe an hour and a half).&nbsp; I
            don't like ground spawns.&nbsp; Ok, it's all been said before.&nbsp;
            Look at one of the <a href="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000298.html" style="color: #0000FF">posts</a>
            by Akane; she makes an excellent point.&nbsp; Verant gave us pretty
            good armor (well, better than steel plate) and a damned nice weapon.&nbsp;
            With these changes and the recent sit/med change, they have done a <b>lot</b>
            to improve the game for our class.&nbsp; I'm having a lot more fun
            now than I was two months ago, are you?</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>If you haven't heard by now, with the most recent patch Paladins
            and Shadowknights had their quest armor's AC increased.&nbsp; That's
            great; as plate wearing classes it was odd, to say the least, that
            their armor provided less protection than the quest armor available
            to chain classes.&nbsp; Um, what about clerics?&nbsp; Aren't we a
            plate class also?&nbsp; Why do I still have the feeling that the
            designer's at Verant are not communicating on the quests.&nbsp; I
            feel that our armor should be on par with the other plate classes,
            leaving aside the entire issue of the AC of the chain classes.</p>
            <p>I have a suggestion for Verant.&nbsp; Provide a forum where the
            rationales behind such decisions are made available.&nbsp;
            Currently, if you want direct feedback you can either e-mail someone
            you happen to know at Verant, e-mail an address blindly and pray for
            a response, or post something on Alt.Games.Everquest and again hope
            that it catches Brad McQuaid's attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>There may be a very good reason why the cleric quest armor did
            not receive an upgrade.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can't imagine what it
            could be.</p>

            <p>The good thing about the success of the site recently is
            tremendous amount of information contained on our boards about our
            class.&nbsp; The bad news is I'm way behind on my e-mail.&nbsp; I
            apologize for the total lack of responses.&nbsp; Changes are coming
            soon among which will allow the administrators (i.e. hint, more than
            me) to be much more responsive.&nbsp; Please be patient while this
            site goes through it's next transition.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Last weekend I received a reply from GZ on a few questions I
            asked him.&nbsp; To paraphrase:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Manastones have been removed from the drop table and will
                return as a quest (I did not ask him when).</li>
              <li>The conversion rate on Manastones is 60 Hit Points for 20 Mana
                (not the widely reported 60-30).</li>
              <li>There is no such thing as <i>Armor Absorption</i>, it's purely
                AC.</li>
              <li>Spells do <b>not</b> get better with use beyond that which is
                dictated by the character's level and skill with the particular
                spell discipline (e.g. Evocation or Alteration).&nbsp;
                Therefore, casting Holy Might 1000s of times does not increase
                ones success with the spell once Evocation has been maxed for
                that level.</li>
