: Where to start?

: I've played Warriors, Wizards, Clercs & so on...

: I've worked each class well into thier 20's or better, too.

: Root, whether its being cast by a Wizard, or Cleric,, has always been a sticky issue.  Enstill isn't much better.

: I must agree w/ the other 2 who've posted.  I use Holy Might endlessly, & IMHO is easily one of my most used spells.  Holy Might is the 19L stun spell.  It had approx 10 sec stun period, & hits for 30 points of dmg, + 1 point per level.

: It gets resisted at most,, 10% of the time.  Not near as bad as root.  These 10 seconds, is more than enough time, for you (or yer wizard) to get off a final blast,, or yer tanks to finish shredding the target.

: PLUS, I use it actively during melee sessions.
: 1)  If the mobs are stunned, they're not beating on my tanks.
: 2)  I AM doing SOME dmg.

: 1 more thing on root,, some mobs inherently have higher magic resistance than others.  Some are easier to root than others, as a result.
