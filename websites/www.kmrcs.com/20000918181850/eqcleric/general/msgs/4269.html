Nice sentiment!  I like your style :)<p>Stupid people should die a whole bunch of times, maybe some of them will learn.  If not, at least it keeps 'em away from the higher level dungeons for awhile.<p>At higher levels, ALL a cleric does is buff/med/heal/med etc etc.  There MAY be times when you throw a nuke, but you are a healer- not a blaster or warrior, and the only time I ever melee is when I'm FM, no one needs a heal and we pulled only one (mostly to stop the boredom- my 1-24 damage with the BE Mace is pretty bad)<br>
