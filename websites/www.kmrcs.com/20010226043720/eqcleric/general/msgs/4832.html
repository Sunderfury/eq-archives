Sure, Atone would be nice, but with 4 mobs beating you for 80+ damage twice a round, can't really get spells off at all.  Is the group makeup at 35+ now going to have to change completely?

It would seem to me if the number of tanks equalled the number of monsters, we'd be ok, one on one for a tank is pretty easy, and easier to pull off me or the wiz.  Any suggestions?  I know a lot of you have run into this problem, and i'd rather get some expert advice than learn by trial and error (esp while i'm in a hell level)<p>: Thanks<br>: Khalim<br>: Cleric of the 35th Circle<br>: Innoruuk<p>

: Try not to heal to early & dont heal to full hp (unless you rearly need to for some reason).

: Have the tanks hit/toughnt all the mobs if possible.

: Keep DA and DB memorised at all times. Once you have healed (try to leave this until the tanks have hit/toughnted the mobs a few times) and the mobs go frency hit one of the above and back out.

: Set up a hot key saying &quot;Invulnrable cant cast or be casted on&quot; and one saying &quot;Get this mob of me&quot; or somthing similar.

: Use the 1st one several times once you hit DA/DB, nothing worse than somone burning mana or even lay on hands to no-effect when you cast this spell.

: DA/DB should get the mobs off you (act's like an anti-toughnt) if it doesnt hit the other button until the tanks get them of you. If that tanks can't get them off you get your group out of there by running, evac or Gate; A dead clerics no good for anyone, especialy not you.
