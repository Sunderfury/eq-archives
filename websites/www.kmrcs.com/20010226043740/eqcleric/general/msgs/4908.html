You certainly do attempt to rationalize it well, however there are some real questionable "facts" in there, as well as ommissions of other facts that really make comparing Druids and Clerics a whole different argument.<p>The truth is, comparing Druids and Clerics is the old apples and oranges cliche.  Sure, Verant considers Druids a, "Healing Class," but the healing is only a portion of what they are about.  A very small portion.<p>But if we were to buy into your comparison we could look at a few things you say.<p>You say that DoT spells are useless in group situations with other casters.  I really beg to differ on this one.  Obviously, at some point in the game you must have been in a group that was swarmed over by multiple MOBs.  Sure the wizards can nuke, but a healthy dose of DoTs on the mobs that aren't under direct scrutiny of the Nukers certainly helps to soften up the rest of the attacker.  And the average DoT is so much more mana efficient than any standard DD spell that they can be cast and still leave mana for other stuff.<p>OK, druids lose out on healing in later levels.  I admit that.  I haven't seen any complaints on my Druid site about it, like you claim, but maybe I am just blind.  Anyway. What we do have is regeneration spells.  Pack regeneration.  Chloroplast.  Ok, so maybe they don't heal the emergency situation, but they do help prevent the emergency situation from even happening.<p>And when it comes to emergency situations isn't it nice to know that your Druid can always cast a Succor and evac the party to safety instead of having to resurrect the dead guys in those situations when your group is in over its head?<p>And who doesn't beg for SoW every chance they get?  And then there's the bit about group teleports, but I digress...<p>What I am getting at, is any class is viable if played to its advantages properly.  Druids have a very unique place in that they can take over many roles for many different situations.  Are they better than clerics?  Hmmmm. Won't answer that question.  Don't think there is even an argument.
