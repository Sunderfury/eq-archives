<br>: Now as for druid or shaman. Actually at the low lvl's you are talking about they are about equal.  At lvl 19-24 shaman's and clerics heal the same. Same with lvl 9-14 I think.  And they have SoW and better dmg nukes and melee. I do however feel cleric buffs still surpass shaman and druids at low lvls.  For example who cares about str when the str bonus doesn't happen until lvl 20? Yeah so you can carry more =)<p>I thought shaman and druids (all priests) had the same fighting skills (max at 4*lvl+4)?  If so then why doesn't anyone ever complain about shaman or druids being lousy fighters and useless in melee like everyone says clerics are?

Why would a warrior want SoW in battle?  I don't know about higher level MOBs but the ones that i fight right now don't move around that much, and when there is a runner we certainly don't need SoW to catch it (at worst just DD it or try to root.. both of which clerics can do in a pinch).
