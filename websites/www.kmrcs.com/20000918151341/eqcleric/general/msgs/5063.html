I performed a Revive on a low level troll who died in front of guk one night while waiting for my party.  She said she received a message that she got xp back.  Since she was only level 4, that is very doubtful.  I think this message perhaps pops up sometimes on Revives and maybe it's the source of the rumor.<p>Lucretia Rialsq<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Bristlebane<p>
