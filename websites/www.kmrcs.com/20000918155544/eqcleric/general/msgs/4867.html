: I play all 3 priest classes and a cleric is the last person
: I would want as a low level warrior (at high levels a cleric would
: be my number one want)

: 1) SOW makes death VERY unlikely.  If I can break away at 2 bubbles and
: the enemy can't catch my I can zone out and not lose exp.

: 2) In a group if you kill something quickly then healing is purely an after
: battle affair.  So a shaman with his DOT's and debuffs (he gets some of the same
: speed affecting spells as a cleric) or a Druid with his DD's and Damage shields is 
: going to make my levelling much easier than a cleric.

: 3) Up until level 30 your can avoid fighting casters for the most part. Without casters providing a large
: dump of damage then during combat healing is not as vital as it is when facing high level caster MOB's.

: There is a reason why they sayShaman and Druids are much better fighters.  Its not because they
: are better at melee (all priest classes are the same, excepting racial differences) but that the DOT's, 
: speed affecting spells, and dmg shields make a huge difference.  If you have a druid buddy have him 
: cast a damage shield on you before take on a MOB you would normally not be able to melee, cast a DOT on the mob and then
: SOW you so that you could run far enough away so that you would never have to worry about your DD being interrupted.

: Of the 4 abilities that aid in shortening a combat or running away:
: (DOT, Debuffs, SOW, and Dmg Shields) a cleric has none and a Shaman or Druid has 3 of the 4...

: you do the math...

: My primary character is my cleric because I prefer playing as a Dark Elf.
: but if a DE could be a druid i'd be there in a sec...
