I'm now lvl 21 and just wanted to share some of the things I've picked up while playing.<p>I used to heal others whenever their life dropped enough for me to get a full heal off.  Not really that good.  Now I only heal warriors at about 50% health.  The threshold for casters is a bit higher because of their low hp.<p>This is better for a number of reasons.  You save your mana for the potential situation where one guy gets in really bad trouble and needs all your mana dumped into him to survive.  It doesn't make sense to heal a guy that may not ever get hit again.  It also allows the MOB to go aggro on the warriors enough so that your heals don't piss it off.<p>Two, you should be spooking or fearing everything in sight when you get jumped unexpectedly.  This is far more mana efficient because of the simple concept of divide and conquer.  Use it liberally.  It's cheap and 5x more efficient than healing.<p>Three, clerics really take it in the rear end when the party is disorganized.  When others are dying, freqeuently you are expected to sit around and stop it from happening.  The problem is that you don't have a backup if something ugly decides to latch itself onto you.  This has been quite painful for me to learn.  If this happens, take it upon yourself to head the party...you as the healer know when the mana is out and everyone is going to die.  Keep people updated and direct the plan of attack and execution.<p>Four, I read a great tidbit about messing with KS'ers.  Fear their kills.  It works great.<p>Fifth, try to instill into other party members the importance of not running around too much.  I can't recall the number of times I've seen some casters running around like a chicken with its head cut off the instant a MOB latches onto him and starts doing some worrisome damage.  It makes it impossible for warriors to taunt or hit the MOB and sometimes they even run out of heal range.  Meanwhile, the MOB is still hitting them so it's not like that does any good.  I still see some regular party members doing it and it pisses me off.  The proper strategy is to stand still and let the warriors take it off before backing away.<p>Just some stuff off the top of my head.  Fun game.
