: Ok, the spell line lull -> soothe -> calm, etc is supposed to let you pull one mob from a group of mobs, correct?  Well every single time I try that it doesn't work and they all end up coming after me.<p>: Example:  I see a room with 3 elite goblin guards.  I calm two of them sucessfully (they look less aggerssive it says) so then I smite the 3rd (I also tried walking up to the 3rd and attacking it) and every time they ALL come after me.<p>: What am I doing wrong?<p>: Thanks,<br>: Vinlaen of Rallos Zek (lvl 20)<p>I have been told that this spell line works with your Charisma score.  So, the lower the charisma the less it will work, and, since my charisma is 36 (wearing grotesque mask - I am sooo ugly) I rarely calm, lull etc. anything successfully.  However, I have a human paladin friend with a charisma of like 80 (1,000,000 in my book) and she successfully calms stuff all the time.
