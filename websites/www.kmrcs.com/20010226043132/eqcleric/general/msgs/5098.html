Opps My apology Gogrim I placed my post in the wrong spot.  It should have been below citras. Anyhow  I am sorry, I just get sick of others that whine so much that they get asked to do reses or any other cast clarity or sow.  It is our job so lets just do it.  Of course I wont do it unless i am not busy that should be understood by all and if not to hell with them.  If ya get a donation great if not wave to the fellow and play on.  If you dont want to be bothered with the res request go anon.  (oh the other cleric was not on yet he came in awhile after I resed, just the word that I helped got to him.)  Lastly sorry to hear about your computer I hate that too.  Good luck on getting EQ running on NT and if ya could post how ya did it when ya are finished.<br>
