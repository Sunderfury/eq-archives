From 16th, till where i am now, 27, almost all my exp has been gained in Unrest... but the problem with that is you won't get GOOD loot until you get about 20-21... As with items, depends what race, +wis are a good bet, but if your a high elf some +str aren't too bad either, dwarf +agi, etc etc. I'm at 27th lvl, 82 str, 151 wis, and 350 pp in the bank.  Also get yourself a nice weapon, believe it or not you WILL melee, just not take the damage... even though not many ppl seem to agree with me :).  Unless its a hard battle, i always deal out about 150 dmg in a battle with my black enamelled mace...
