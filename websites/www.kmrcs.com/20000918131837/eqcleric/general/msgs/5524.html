: This has been brewing for some time...

: (Start rant)

Whatever I do I get to stare at that spell screen (and/or a tree stump) for hours on end.

: I have the last couple of weeks been going trying to get the following items:

: JBoots
: Paw of Opallo
: Testament of vanear

: Did I succeed, You ask? The answer is no! I spent about 2 weeks in Najena (can only play about 3 to 4 hours tops every night) and another 2 weeks doing the Paw quest. Has killed Mitty +50 times now and that last gold ring is still missing. Every time I went &quot;home&quot; to Rivervale I checked out the spawn for the testament quest in HH and it has been camped (nearly) every time.

: And now this... The new cleric specific armor quests - which I, as a halfling, can't even wear...
