<I><br>: Ok, first you need to get a Tumpy Tonic. You can have a skilled brewer make for you or have Tumpy Irontoe in Kaladim make for you. The ingredients are 1 Kiola Nut and 1 water flask. The only place you can get the Kiola nut is from vendor in Inn on Sisters of Erollisi island. Get several in case the brewer fails :)<p>: Then you go to Highhold Keep- not the pass, zone all the way into city. Jovan will be wandering around somewhere. I have seen him below the bank in pickclaw dungeon, on the main floor, on the 2nd floor, and on the 4th floor. Just keep looking. Once you find him keep hailing him til he stops. Then give him the Tumpy Tonic. Voila! He poofs and gives you the Icon of the Fervent. He then respawns somewhere else in zone almost immediately (FINALLY A DECENT SPAWN RATE!!!). If you want to talk to him, ask about Tumpy Tonic and not Tumpy's Tonic as he says in brackets. SO the whole trick of this one is getting the tonic made.<p>: Good luck all!<br></I><br>Tumpy, Jovan and many of their friends would just love to filet my dark elf cleric alive, so like many other quests i will have to buy this item if it becomes available.  is it NO DROP?
