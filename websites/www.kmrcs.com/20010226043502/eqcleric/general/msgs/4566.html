At higher levels..  With a good group that knows what they are doing, i get maybe one attack msg on me and a tank has allready taunted it off..  In multible monster fights.   <p>Lets go into my favorite setting for a group of players.  My alltime favorite grou would consist of a cleric, a ranger, a warrior, a wizzard, a shaman, and a Enchanter.<p>Ranger, Dmg isn't as good as warrior, but snare turns the tide in battles allmost every time.<p>Wiz, basic Nuke to death when mobs are 45% hp and still have 80+% mana.  Plus you need a Evac caster no matter what i higher level places.  <p>Warrior:  your all around meat shield, takes the dmg, deals it out and jumps around fight keeping all mobs on him  (when there isn't an enchanter present)<p>enchanter:  Enchanter is prolly one of the Best classes in the game.  Mezzmerize is just un beatable.  You have an enchanter 1 group can go about anywhere in the world.  Match up with Swift Like the Wind, your tanks are super cracke out, and Clarity for mages..  ='s less down time and faster killing.<p>Shaman:  Their slow spell is unbeatable..  Enchanters come close, but not quite to the edge of what a shaman brings.   Match that up with the Buffs he/she can throw on tanks and your deadly.<p>Cleric:  We all know what we do :)<p>When somethin pulls on me, the tanks get it off quick.  So all in all i'd go for that extra Wis instead of the AC..  at lvl 50, that 4 wis ='s what?  60ish mana?  which helps tremendously<p>Rashklar<br>Clain<br>Test Server.<p>: Still far away from 30 let alone 40,but i would say the Mithril is better.The extra AC and Agility will help you keep casting when mobbed.Also i would assume that you have enough other +wis items to balance the loss of the +4 from BS tunic<p>

: Ranger, Dmg isn't as good as warrior, but snare turns the tide in battles allmost every time.

: Wiz, basic Nuke to death when mobs are 45% hp and still have 80+% mana.  Plus you need a Evac caster no matter what i higher level places.  

: Warrior:  your all around meat shield, takes the dmg, deals it out and jumps around fight keeping all mobs on him  (when there isn't an enchanter present)

: enchanter:  Enchanter is prolly one of the Best classes in the game.  Mezzmerize is just un beatable.  You have an enchanter 1 group can go about anywhere in the world.  Match up with Swift Like the Wind, your tanks are super cracke out, and Clarity for mages..  ='s less down time and faster killing.

: Shaman:  Their slow spell is unbeatable..  Enchanters come close, but not quite to the edge of what a shaman brings.   Match that up with the Buffs he/she can throw on tanks and your deadly.
