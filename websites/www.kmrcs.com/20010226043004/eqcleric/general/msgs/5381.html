Ooofff, you're right.  Either way, is it worth the hassle, plus the 113pp it's going to cost to buy a bar of platinum?   Especially, when you consider that bronze armor generally can be purchased for in the 10-20pp per piece range.  I MIGHT do the gloves, because of the AGI.  The disease factor seems pretty useless.<p>Tomma<p>: The gauntlets are the ones that are + agi, the boots are the sv disease.  Granted the AC is better on the new quest boots than is Bronze, but is it worth the pain of going through all that stuff to get them?  To me it's not.<br>
