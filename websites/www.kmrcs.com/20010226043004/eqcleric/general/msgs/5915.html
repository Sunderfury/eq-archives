 dark elf clerics, of innoruuk, now have the chane to gain a series of amulets, each has the effect of a necro item, the first one you obtain is ac3, +1 wis, +3 mana, magik, no drop, and casts the effect of weaken ( left click, may wanna make the a hot key for this.).<br>   It is the first in a series of 3 , in a quest that if started at a early age will take you to lvl 30 to finish. tthe best part is the quest seems to be one of the better quest, i have ever done in the game , and not to spoil it for any of you, but the amulets you get are seem alot better then the last, and are really, really , a must get. also this is a free quest. <p><p>
