Heh, the first part is correct.  The stun line of spells is a all-or-nothing saving throw.  However, that's the only saving throw.  If it succeeds, you do max damage.  If it fails, the target resists the stun.  That's why you never see holy might (force of sound of force) do anything less than max.<p>Hope if helps<p>Stump (Krieger)<p><br>: The stun line of spells (i.e. Stun, Holy Might, Force, Sound of Force) have an all or nothing saving throw. There are no partial resists with stun. That is why it is resisted more often.<p>: All or nothing spells always have a higher resist rate than others. <p>: Another reason is because the spell stuns, and does damage, meaning that the monster get's a saving throw vs the damage as well as vs the stun.<p>: Hope that answered your questions<p>: Frepin Arreew<br>: 40 cleric, Tunare<p>
