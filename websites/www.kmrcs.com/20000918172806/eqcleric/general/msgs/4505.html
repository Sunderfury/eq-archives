As for the counter points.<p>"People could drag your corpse somehwere dangerous..."<p>They can do that with /consent now.  They don't do it though because that means THEY have to go there to die as well.

The reason for /drag was to let someone who you don't trust very much drag your corpse out for you...not so you wouldn't get confused.<p>Monkey is an interchangable term for a 70%'r

: As for the counter points.

: &quot;People could drag your corpse somehwere dangerous...&quot;

: They can do that with /consent now.  They don't do it though because that means THEY have to go there to die as well. And they get nothing out of it.

: &quot;put a msg box with do you realize this person can choose to rob you blind?&quot;

: While that sounds good in theory anyone giving another consent to loot your corpse knows this.  Unless he is a complete moron...in which case the monkey will push either button since he is a moron =) (trust me on this I know my monkeys). The reason for /drag was to let someone who you don't trust very much drag your corpse out for you...not so you wouldn't get confused.

: Monkey is an interchangable term for a 70%'r
