Ouch on the GIBs.

We did this from the executioner room and pulled every room around us (total of 10 people in the zone- other 4 were grouped at entrance).  Only bummer is that once we were ready to go we had no group gate, so we went invis vs undead.  Made it to bridge to the tower before it popped, fought the rest of the way out.<br>
