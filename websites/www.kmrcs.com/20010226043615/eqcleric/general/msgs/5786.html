I agree with you on one point - this is not meant to be comparable to PoF armor. But it SHOULD be comparable to the other class specific armor that was implemented. The other class specific armor (including crafted) all has stat boosts to the "major" stats. I don't think that every piece should have +wis - I like the idea of rounding out the stats the way they do. But the breastplate is just completely disappointing. Can you imagine having a wizard only robe without +int? It's just silly. Even if the bracers and helm both have +wis (which I doubt), the breastplate should have had at least a +5 wis boost. <p>: Seems many players are expecting PoF armor here. And even it has very few peices that are +wis. This armor is supposed to "replace" rubcite. Which it is comaparable to. So whats the big deal. Where is this rule that class specific armor MUST add +'s to main attribute(s)? I just cant jump on this bandwagon. <p>: : Ok, here it goes.  i got the new cleric legs and i think they are nice.  only problem i have is with one of the stats.  the stats are ac11 +5int +5sv poison.  we are clerics and are wisdom based so why would they put int on our legs?  i think its a type, so i petitioned it.  the gm (who was really cool) told me he thinks its odd for us to have int buff rather then wisdom and to report it as a bug.  well i did, and he said he was going to report it as well.  if you guys agree with me will you please report this as a bug next time your on and petition it as well so we can try to get this fixed?  please give me feedback via this post or my e-mail.<p>: : Gallanorf<br>: : 35 cleric E'CI<p>
