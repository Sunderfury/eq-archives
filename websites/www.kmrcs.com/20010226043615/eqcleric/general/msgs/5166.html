Not sure but if its 6 hours for a bag to spawn it would be totally ridiculous and would basically go against what Brad calls "putting the Quest back into EverQuest".<p>I thought I read somewhere that you also need plat enchanted bars for the quests.  Oh boy if thats true count me out.  Hell I can barely afford my buff gems.<p>So far from the 2 pieces or armor that have been posted the armor looks prett bad itself, so I won't be in a rush to get it.  Maye the other pieces might be better, but I highly doubt it.<p>: I read now on few boards, that the<br>: necessary ingots etc spawn every 6h as bags on floor?<p>: They are no drop if some passer by picks em up.<p>: I hope this is not really true, I'd abhorr camping <br>: empty spots even more then camping mobs :((<p>: any ideas/followups?<p>
