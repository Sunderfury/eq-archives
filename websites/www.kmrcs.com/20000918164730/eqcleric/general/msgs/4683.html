: Hello all of you devote clerics you!

: Yes I am a druid.  A 23rd level Human druid who plays on the Quellious Server.  I just wanted to let you know that I as a druid am actually jealous of clerics.

: I am not jealous of your power, your spells, or your armor.  I am jealous of your ability to find a group.

: Right now I am finding it very hard to find a group because a druid is not immediatly considered &quot;necessary&quot; for groups.  A Cleric is however always welcome.

: I also like to fact that you can resurect people from the dead.. always a nice ability.

: Druids DO get a lot of great spells.  The most diverse line in all of the classes.  At the end of the day though we usually set up our camps on the lonely field of Karana's Plains.

: If any of you need a partner in battle look me up on my server. I promise to not fall into the &quot;idiot&quot; druid syndrome.  I have been in most dungeons, and have maxed offense, defense, and 1HB skill (proof of not kiting myself to my level.)

: I think that a Druid / Cleric team could do VERY WELL.

: So lets all just try to get along ok? :)

: P.S. Oh yes.  I did post here earlier about a druid petition.  I was clarifying in that message what the petition was about, but I NEVER said that I endorsed the petition. I am very happy with my druid, and although I would like to see them get more stuff (as would every class), I never supported the petition, and I feel that Verant is doing an admirable job.
