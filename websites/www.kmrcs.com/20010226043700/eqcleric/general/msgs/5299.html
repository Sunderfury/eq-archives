I've heard of friends having situations something like what you did.  A friend of mine at work was with his regular group (he's a level 38 ranger) and they were in some nasty dungeon when he fell from a bridge or something.  The wierd thing was the bridge he fell from was only like 25-30 feet above the ground, but somehow he fell into a wierd pocket and took like 26000 points of damage.  He was teleported back to his bind spot and then he did a group tell to have them try to see where his corpse was.  He sat at his bind spot waiting for his group to locate his corpse.  After about 30 mins of exploring, they reported back that they couldn't get to his corpse or find it.  He petitoned a GM and after a bit of time the GM sent him a message which he responded to and told him exactly what had happened and that this group coudln't get to his corpse due to the fact that he had fallen into a pocket in space or such and they couldn't find his corpse.  The GM replied back saying that he looked and couldn't find his corpse and that there wasn't anything he could do to help.  Well my friend decdied he was going to go back to the dungeon and look around and see if he could do anything.  Just as he zoned into the dungeon entrance he saw a corpse partially buried in a wall and clicked on it and it was his corpse.  The strange thing he said was that they had spent about 20-30 mins trying to get to the point at which he had died and he couldn't figure out how his corpse had gotten way up at the entrance.<p><p>: Anyone have this happen to them before?   Is this a<br>: known bug, like the zone bug?<p>: I was in W Freeport, and had time to kill waiting for<br>: some friends to get online, and I tried to do the quest<br>: where you kill the halfling named Shintl Lowbrew in<br>: one of the inns.

So I'm thinking<br>: that somehow I died and fell into a wall, and now I'm<br>: trapped in the terrain.  At this point a GM Guide<br>: answers my petition, asks a few questions (Are you<br>: sure you're looking in the area you died?
