: We are the smart more powerful ones.  Warriors can't solo a HG clerics can.

: Yet we still send them to go pull.  We send them to the front lines to die.

: And you know why most warriors don't mind that? Because we are even more powerful in a group then solo.

: So following that line of thinking if we can kill thengs they can't solo....and we are even more powerful in a group.

: How the hell are we useless to the group?

: I'm glad he is not on my server.  We have enough idiots already without this &quot;kind of the idiots&quot; around. I really feel sorry for anyone that has had the misfortune of meeting this moron in-game or worse yet IRL.

: If I was his father I would be asking my wife to get an abortion right now...a tad overdue.

: He can't stand for us to be happy playing a simple game as a healer.  I don't see what his problem is.  He has some serious issues...any psychologist will tell you someone who can't stand for another person to be happy is clearly not happy themselves....
