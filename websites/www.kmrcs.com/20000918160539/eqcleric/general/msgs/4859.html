: Armour is a mute point all priest classes lose hp quickly. At low - mid levels clerics have the advantage of wearing plat. At mid - high levels shamans could also wear plate (ruby, etc) but most clerics and shamans go for wis enhancing items (or at least a combo of wis and ac).<p>How can armor be a mute point?  I know that priest classes have less hp, but that's all the more reason to wear BETTER armor.  As a dwarf cleric i don't believe that my sta or str is TOO far behind a barbarian shaman (although i give props to the trolls and orges... big mothers) so i think that i'm comparable in melee and ac should give me a distinct advantage.  Also, i'd like to know what the "etc" is in your statement (rubi, etc).. especially since rubi is being removed soon i don't think shaman will be able to get ANY plate-like armor, nor will druids will they?  i personally play a battle-cleric dwarf so ac is kind of important to me.. i know most people don't think a cleric can fight but i think they can a little.. not nearly as good as a monk, warrior, or hybrid but still enough to toss out a few points of damage for fun.
