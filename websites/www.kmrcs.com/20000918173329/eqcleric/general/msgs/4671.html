Not quite the same thing but still great fun. That run back from Halas was a killer though ;)<p>: We worked to the bedroom...med up. Backspawns already popping.<br>: . Kill the spiders and bats to the gargs...med up...more backspawns....see just how far your group could push before evacing<br>: Hehe...a dungeon crawl...imagine that. It very fun..there were no maps, you didnt know what or where rare spawns where and got VERY excited when you saw one for the first time because you didnt know what item he possesed.<br>: . Was awesome. Thanks for the memories EQ.  I wish every player could have played the good zones like that.<p>: <br>: : When I did it I got invited into a guild hunt (they needed a cleric ;)) there were two full parties doing the hand and AM. Most of the others were red to me, with a couple of yellow's. Towards the end of the night, when we got down to about 1 party we ended up evacing. Mobs were coning anyware from blue to red for me.<p>: : Wouldnt like to do this in a single 35 party either. Although the place is normaly camped out so it's probably easyer than when you first camped it Badaf.<p>
