I'm all for getting rid of corpses, the abuse of using it for teleporting etc.  But the way they went about it is totally wrong.<p>The reason why I hate this rule is really simple.  It doesn't even give me the opportunity to get to places to help people.<p>Whether you know alot of people in the game, or if a corpse is deep within a dungeon, you want to help them.  Sure people say that they will understand when you can't res them.  Well damn, that kinda makes me feel cheap as a cleric having a skill I can't use.  God forbid they make my res spells only work to the party im currently in.<p>Here's a little scenario which I will say is very common.  So lets say my friend is doing a hell level (40 or 45) and they die.  They lose a full bub of XP like you do on hell levels.  It takes REAL long to get a full bubble on the hell levels, sometimes many nights.  You will want to res them saving them many nights of gaming, and getting the corpse back may take a long time.  This 2 hr rule hinders my ability to res people.<p>Make it a day or so and I'll be happy but 2 hrs is just outright ridiculous.  This change hinders my role as a cleric, plain and simple.<p>What I'm doing to combat this now is simple.  Verant really doesn't listen much but hey I'm still trying and hoping they change this.  I'm asking people I res to send /feedback to Verant, as well as leave an item on their corpse to make a statement.  I urge other clerics who believe the 2hr time should be increased to do the same.<p>I really can't help people when a game mechanic stops me from doing it.<p><br>: Words can not express my anger at Verant. I suppressed any comment about the new 2 hour corpse resurrection rule because simply, there's nothing that can be done. Verant does what they please without regard to the customer - just one more case in point.<p>: But if the corpse is over 2 hours old, does it tell you? SURE it tells you, right after it takes your 500 mana and flushes it down the pipes. Oh and then it says some message about how you failed and should try again later. Excuse me? This is the poorest excuse for a game development company I have EVER encountered, and I have encountered plenty. <p>: So in addition to asking that they extend this insane time period to 4 hours, perhaps you should also ask that they notify us BEFORE we res that the corpse is 2 hours old, instead of after. What a bunch of idiots.<p>
