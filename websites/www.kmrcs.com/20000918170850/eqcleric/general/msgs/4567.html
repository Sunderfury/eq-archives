Posted by Biff on October 08, 1999 at 08:27:26:<p>
Can anyone tell me what determines if a hit, during a combat round, is successful or not?  (i.e. causes damage to an opponent)  A bard friend and I were in WK last night fighting beetles.  She hit twice as often as I (having a much faster 1H piercing weapon and I with my 2HB hammer) yet she also had approximately a 95% success rate for her hits, whereas I only caused damage on about 55% of mine.  We have equal levels in our respective 1HP / 2HB skills, and are the same level overall.<p>Basically what I am looking for here, is a way to improve my odds of causing damage for a round in which I swing my hammer.  Any insight to this would be appreciated.<p>Thanks.<br>
