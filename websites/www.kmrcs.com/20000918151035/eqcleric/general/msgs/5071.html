I generally reserve the symbols for myself.  If I am in a group, I will sometimes buff the tank with the symbol.  If others in the group request the symbol for them, I will explain the cost of casting the symbol on them and let them offer to pay for costs of obtaining more of the symbol components.  Most people generally don't have a problem understanding that.<p><p>: I was just sitting here pondering the game.  Good things, bad things,, things I'd like to do differently, etc...<p>: Everyone is clearly aware of the Symbol line of buffing spells.  Cleric's all over Norrath are clearly aware that the least expensive of these cost 2.5GP each time you cast it.  This expense becomes higher & higher as you get new spells.  <p>: Some folks are rather judicious about letting the cleric take a good portion of the loot to cover these expenses.  Others are still money grubs.<p>: Then, my thoughts turned to those who are willing to pay pp to get SOW or be bound at a city.  <p>: I'm curious how folks would feel about paying for symbols.  Any input would be appreciated.<p>: As it is now, I really don't pass it around, because of the expense.  What are y'all thoughts...<p>
