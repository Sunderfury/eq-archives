Lake Rathe and S. Karana are excellent places to hunt at your level.  I started S.K. at Lev 20 and still fight there today.  Start in Aviak City or just inside the Rathe zone (nice thing is these are close to each other too).  Inside the Rathe Zone you have gnolls to gnoll embalmers by day and skels, DB Skels and greater zombies by night.<br>These areas can get crowded though....<p>Trewithen Woundhealer<br>Tribulation Force<br>Priest of Tunare<br>Povar<p><br>: I am a level 21 High Elf Cleric and need some advice on where to hunt.  <p><br>: Ziggi,<br>: Healer of Tunare<p>
