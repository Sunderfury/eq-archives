: I absolutely agree with Ren here.  Unrest, once you get used to it, provides very fast experience and the opportunity to *really* get to know your group members.

: Read the &quot;Unrest Guide&quot; provided on this site and get a map from one of the map sites.

: Some additional tips for hunting Unrest:

: You'll have to get used to the lag in Unrest... frequently it's so bad that even TYPING is like trying to swim through molasses, especically if there's casting going on.  Your mouse will float around and your targetting will be erratic.. use your &quot;F&quot; keys to target group members for heal.

: Always use Invis to Dead BEFORE you enter the zone (to avoid getting hit by the frequent trains -- it won't stop the Werebats or Beetles from seeing you, but it will hide you from the majority of the critters).

: Don't hang out in the zone area!  If you don't have a group already, quickly move through the zone corridor to the Fountain area and stay close to the walls.  While proximity to the walls isn't a guarantee of safety, it does take you off the train tracks.   

: If you're hunting outside and pulling from house, use the back door or side door and keep your group up against the walls.  Have your puller bring the critters to the wall and DON'T let the group run up to the door to start pounding on the MOBs, no matter how tempting this may be.  If you fight in the middle of the yard, you'll be right in the way of any trains which pass that way (or trains returning to the house from the zone) and you'll also attract the attention of the lawn trash.  So stick close to the walls.

: Do NOT let your puller pull too fast!  If he/she won't listen to you, find another group.  Too-much-too-fast is especially deadly in Unrest.  As a cleric, you shouldn't have any trouble at all in finding a group.

: If possible, try to get another cleric in your group and take turns being the primary healer and a nuker (hey, we gotta get SOME fun with our undead nukes!).  Just make sure the cleric-nuker also saves some mana for heals.

: Keep Spook the Dead memmed at all times.  If you are in the house, the spooked critters may possibly train when they come back, but Spook works real well to scare off the &quot;extras&quot; and gives your group time to zone if necessary.

: ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS shout if your group is running a train to the zone!!

: Once you get high enough to camp a room in the house, get to know your neighbors in adjoining rooms!

But the rewards of good teamwork are the great loot to be had and the superfast experience.  This more than makes up for the inevitable deaths.  You will occasionally die and so will your group members, but... what's a little death among friends?

: Good luck.. and have a blast!!
