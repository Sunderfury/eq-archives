HOW TO TURN $6 INTO $6,000!!!!!! <br>READING THIS COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE! <br>I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while back, I<br>was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came across<br>an article similar to this that said you could make thousands of dollars<br>within weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00! So I thought, Yeah<br>right, this must be a scam,but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept<br>reading. Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of the 6 names and<br>address stated in the <br>article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom of the list<br>at #6, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. <br>(There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over, and<br>talking to a few people first, I thought about trying it. I figured: what have I<br>got to lose except 6 stamps and $6.00, right? Then I invested the measly<br>$6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!!... within 7 days, I started getting money in the<br>mail! I was shocked! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept<br>coming in. In my first week, I made about $25.00. By the end of the second<br>week I had made a total of over $1,000.00! In the third week I had over<br>$10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I have<br>made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly. It's<br>certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more <br>than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most<br>importantly, why it works....Also, make sure you print a copy of this article<br>NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you<br>that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will start making more<br>money than you thought possible by doing something so easy! <br>Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download it.)<br>Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in! <br>It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage) <br>IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it<br>is virtually no risk - it really works!!!! <br>If all of the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive<br>extraordinary dividends. <br>PLEASE NOTE: <br>Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $50,000 or more can be yours<br>in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the honesty<br>and integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully<br>adhering to the instructions. <br>You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this business your<br>product is not solid and tangible, it's a service. You are in the business of<br>developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are happy to pay big<br>bucks for quality lists. However, the money made from the mailing lists is<br>secondary to the income which is made from people like you and me asking<br>to be included in that list. <br>Here are the 4 easy steps to success: <br>STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece<br>of paper;PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST. Now <br>get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so<br>the bill will not be seen through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next,<br>place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them. You should now<br>have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above<br>phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is<br>creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a<br>legitimate service and you are paying for <br>it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal<br>aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office<br>(1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed LEGAL! Mail the 6<br>envelopes to the following addresses:  <br>#1)Jeff Millan <br>1113 N. 19 ? <br>McAllen,TX 78501 <br>#2) R. Overton <br>P.O. Box 18818 <br>So. Lake Tahoe, CA 96151 <br>#3) KEVIN LEE <br>8377 APT. I MONTGOMERY RUN RD. <br>ELLICOTT CITY MD 21043 <br>#4) JEREMY KIM <br>2968 ROYAL PALM DR. #D <br>COSTA MESA, CA 92626 <br>#5)CHEY RAINEY<br>P.O. Box 753<br>FONTANA, CA 92334 <br>#6)Jacob Lineberry   341 Brookfield cir.  Sanford, NC 27330 <p>STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the<br>other names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as<br>number 6 on the list. <br>STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article as close<br>to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least 200<br>newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is 200,<br>but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! <br>This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 &<br>1341 of the Postal lottery laws. <br>Keep a copy of these steps for yourself and, whenever you need money,<br>you can use it again, and again. <br>PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the<br>honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to<br>the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the program will<br>continue and the money that so many others have received will come your<br>way. <br>NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either<br>on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. <br>This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a<br>good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) <br>So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six<br>members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with<br>one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when<br>your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of<br>dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the<br>first six people listed above) Send <br>it now, add your own name to the list and you're in business! <br>---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------ <br>Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting.<br>Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor<br>to the bottom of this document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This<br>will copy the entire letter into the computer's memory. <br>Step 2) Open a blank 'wordpad' or 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the<br>top of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a<br>copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list. <br>Step 3) Save your new wordpad or notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to<br>do your postings in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back<br>to. <br>Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various<br>newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.) <br>Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message<br>by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit menu.<br>Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they scroll<br>through the list of postings in a particular group, click the post message<br>button. You're done with your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All<br>you have to do is jump to different newsgroups and post away, after you<br>get the hang of <br>it, it will take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup! <br>**REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE<br>MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF<br>200** <br>That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the world within<br>days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the large amount of<br>mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a<br>name to use, as long as <br>the postman will deliver it. <br>**JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.** <br>Now the WHY part: <br>Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very low example). So<br>then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now, each of the 5<br>persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings, each<br>with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original 5,<br>that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts<br>with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional<br>$125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200<br>with my name at #3 and only receive 5 <br>replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK, now here is the fun part,<br>each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2<br>and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made me $3,125.00!!! Those<br>3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 newsgroups with my name<br>at#1 and if still 5 persons per 200 newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00!<br>With an original investment of only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is<br>no longer on the list, you just take the latest posting in the newsgroups,<br>and send out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at<br>number 6 again. And start posting again. The thing to remember is: do you<br>realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet<br>and reading these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can<br>you afford $6.00 and see if it really works?? I think so... People have said,<br>"e;what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the money? So<br>what! What are the chances of that happening when there are tons of new<br>honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet and<br>newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000<br>to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual<br>internet. <br>Remember: play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this will really work. <p><br>
