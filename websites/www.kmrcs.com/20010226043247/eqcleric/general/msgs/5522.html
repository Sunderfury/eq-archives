I believe there is a level restriction on doing the quest.  I successfully did the quest 4 times at lower levels (under 20) and was able to get it.  Once I levelled past 21, I have attempted the quest more times than I can count and have not received the smasher since.  It's a fairly good weapon to use at lower levels, but is non magical which tends to be a major pain.  If you are a patient one you can generally sell them for a decent amount of cash.  I also believe that faction does not play a part in getting the smasher.  I received my first smasher after completing the quest about 30 times.  Then I did the quest about 3 more times and received another.  I went and levelled inbetween the 2nd and 3rd time and then came back and did it again and got it 2nd try.  The last time I received the smasher, I think it took about 5 tries to get it.  Best advice is to plan to spend a good 2-3 days working at it.  Keep working at it and you will get it eventually.<p><p><br>: I'm trying to get the Bullsmasher in Ak'anon.
