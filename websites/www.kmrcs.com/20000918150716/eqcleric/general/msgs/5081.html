I really don't want to be on thier friends list.  I think they are probably pretty weak players and will get me killed fairly quickly...and be asses to boot.  They don't understand the the intricacies of how classes function solo and together.  Verant balanced ALL the classes and each has it's purpose.

: Too many flames by warriors and druids this week.  And none of the posts had valid points.

: I refuse to respond to them anymore it just feeds thier ego's.

: Just stop talking to them...right now if you flame back you are thier only person in the world who talks to them.  They get all excited and what-not.

: If we stop talking maybe they will go in a dark corner and blow thier heads off or something.

: I know I got caught up in defending clerics too.  But really...we don't need to defend ourselves.  Not only do we enjoy our class but we also KNOW we are a much needed class.  Whether these guys know that or not...it isn't our job to teach them how useful clerics are.  They will find out soon enough.  I hope they hate clerics actually.
