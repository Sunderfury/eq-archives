Go to west commons and fight the wisps - they are great xp at your level and you get the chance to get regular/greater lightstones which can add up to some serious plat.  Use your SSOL and you will be be fine.  The strategy to use if root them if possible and then blast.  When they break from the root, melee with the occasional nuke and you are set.  Sit and med and repeat over and over and over.  They (wisps) should get you to around 15 fairly easily.  Also if you are full mana and there aren't any wisps around you can beat on the low blue young kodiaks.  Also you can get a group to do dervs.  They give fairly good xp and occasionally drop bronze weapons which sell pretty good also.  My personal opinion is not to go to befallen as there are way too many trains for the stuff you will needing to kill to get decent xp.<p>Good luck<p><p>: I am a L13 high elf cleric curently in Freeport I was in a group killing paranas in west commons anyway I have full bronze and a SSOF ( shining star of light) and the testimate of vanear and I have found laying around on the group a ignot or icon and a peninate or something of reliance dunno what there for though? any help beyond with my info posted again would be greatly appreciated thx.<p>
