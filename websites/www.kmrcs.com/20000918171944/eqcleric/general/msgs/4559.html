Not sure exactly where he was fighting (he's on a different server than I) - he was with his group going somewhere and he took a bad step and fell about 25-30 feet and took like 6000 points of non melee damage (level 37 ranger) and died.  The spot that he fell in would have been almost impossible to get to via normal means.  They didn't have anybody in their group that could levitate or such so my friend petitioned a GM and explained the situation that he thought it kinda bogus that he had fallen about 25-30 feet and taken 6000 points of damage and that he wanted to know if the GM could move his corpse so he could retrieve it and such.  Well the GM said he couldn't find any problem with what had happended and that he couldn't move the corpse for him.  So my friend was going to head back and see if they could find a different route to get back to his corpse - as he entered the zone area he noticed a corpse partial buried in the wall near the zone and went over to see who's it was and found it was his corpse.  The funny thing he said was that they were a long ways into the zone line and he couldn't figure out how his corpse had gotten to the front of the zone especially since the GM had said he wouldn't move the corpse.<p><p><br>: Was fighting rather deep inside SolA when too much was pulled and I died.  Another member of the group bought it also.  Here's the strange part:<p>: When the evac went off I thought I made it out (was at a sliver of health).  I got the loading message and all that.  After I finished zoning the game decided I died after all and then I started loading again.  Oh well, it happens (hadn't died in a few weeks).  <p>: However, when I zoned back in my corpse was at the zone line.  Great I thought and I looted up.  Not only was my corpse there but so was the other person's.  So I tried to revive, but got a message that the target was too far away.  I had them /consent me and moved the corpse.  Before I could revive again I had to zone.  After zoning back I then revived and it worked normally.<p>: Anyone have any ideas?  Maybe this is a response to the duping bug? (No, I won't explain it =) ).<p>: Rayne<p>
