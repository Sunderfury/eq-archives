I haven't seen Counteract Disease in any cleric guild. I bought mine from the troll that's in the hand in Innothule Swamp. I was running from Cazic to Freeport and stopped to pick it up (I am a High Elf, but he's indifferent to me - weird). I've heard that CD can be bought in necro guilds and at a druid ring (not sure which one). CD is a 29th level spell and I haven't used it yet. I'm not really sure what good it is. I know that Counteract Poison only has to be cast once to cure someone, but the first cure poison spell took 2 to 3 castings. Hope this helps.<p>Klair
