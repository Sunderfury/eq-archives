Well, if you are already bored at level 12, I hate to say it<br>but you might want to try something different. I'm surprised <br>that you're bored already, as I found the options of playing <br>a cleric were amazing, especially in a group! But as you get<br>higher in level, you're likely to find that things get even <br>more boring because you fight less and med more.<p>But to really give it a fair shake, you need to play past <br>level 14, because that's when your life as a cleric really<br>begins. Everything up til then is just training.<p><br>: I am really getting bored playing my cleric, <br>: only 12th level, but the levels really seem to <br>: drag with this character compared to my bard and monk.<br>: Can any high levels give some pointers and adivce on wether <br>: it is worth continuing or should ditch the cleric .<p>: Thanks<br>: Morzeth<p>
