Ok, since CT was down tonight I created a dark elf cleric and went to explore the new temple on the test server. I found two clerics in the temple (all mobs in temple were non-agressive to me but I imagine other religions or races might have troubles. Someone said the basic mobs were level 35 - wards of ro (fire imp), keepers, seekers, and other named npcs).<p>Here is the quest info as pulled from my log file. It appears to be cleric only armor similar to the crafted armor for warriors.<p>You say, 'hail Blaize the Radiant' (A high elf female)<br>Blaize the Radiant says 'Hail, faithful one. I am Blaize the Radiant. Brother Gavel and I are well known among clerics for our forging skills, but special payment is required for our services. Special [ingots and icons] given to our members have been lost, and we will reward whoever retrieves them for us. <br>You say, 'What ingots and icons?'<br>Blaize the Radiant says 'The ingots and icons are all named after the virtues of the cleric who held them. The virtues I require are those of the [Reliant], the [Ardent], the [Fervent] and the [Penitent]. <br>You say, 'What about the Reliant?'<br>Blaize the Radiant says 'Turgan the Reliant lived in a cabin in the Kithicor woods until there was a great fire. Searching the burned cabins there may turn something up. He always loved Lake Rathetear as well. Bring me the Ingot of the Reliant, the Icon of the Reliant, and an Enchanted Platinum Bar and I will forge them into a reward for you. <br>You say, 'What about the Ardent?'<br>Blaize the Radiant says 'Theo the Ardent was in constant war with a gnome necromancer in Befallen named Babbinsbort, but he never could defeat him. Poor Theo drown on an expedition to Everfrost when the ice of the frozen river gave way underneath him. Bring me the Ingot of the Ardent, the Icon of the Ardent, and an Enchanted Platinum Bar and I will forge them into a reward for you. <br>You say, 'What about the Fervent?'<br>Blaize the Radiant says 'Jovan the Fervent was always prone to vice. He lost his ingot in a game of Kings Court with an aviak named Gull in the Ocean of Tears. After that he became a drunkard and it has been said he lurks around the bars in Highpass Hold. Bring me the Ingot of the Fervent, the Icon of the Fervent, and an Enchanted Platinum Bar and I will forge them into a reward for you. <br>You say, 'What about the Penitent?'<br>Blaize the Radiant says 'Astrid the Penitent often visited the frogloks of Upper Guk. She once told me her ingot was hidden underwater there. I found that strange because she couldn't swim. She was also a good friend to the Kerrans of Kerra Ridge, where she lost her life fighting against the Erudite hereitic Maugarim. Bring me the Ingot of the Penitent, the Icon of the Penitent, and an Enchanted Platinum Bar and I will forge them into a reward for you. <br>You say, 'Thank you Blaize'<p><br>You say, 'hail Gavel the Temperant' (a dwarf male)<br>Gavel the Temperant says 'May the fires of Solusek Ro warm your innards! I am Gavel the Temperant. I work with Sister Blaize to forge the most elegent finery for clerics known to man or beast. Because we have no need for material wealth here in the temple, we ask that you retrieve [ingots and Icons] from the lost or fallen brothers and sisters of our order. When mixed with some enchanted platinum into an alloy the items I can forge are splendid indeed! <br>You say, 'What ingots and icons?'<br>Gavel the Temperant says 'The ingots and icons are all named after the virtues of the cleric who held them. The virtues I require are those of the [Reverent], the [Constant], and the [Devout]. <br>You say, 'What about the Reverent?'<br>Gavel the Temperant says 'Regis the Reverent fell in love with a gypsy girl named Lianna Ferasa who lives in the Rathe mountains. Bring me the Ingot of the Reverent, the Icon of the Reverent, and 2 Enchanted Platinum Bars and I will forge them into a reward for you. <br>You say, 'What about the Constant?'<br>Gavel the Temperant says 'Althuryn the Constant was brutally slain by two aqua goblins. The one called Sludge fled to Runnyeye, the one called Bilge lives in Dagnors Cauldron. Bring me the Ingot of the Constant, the Icon of the Constant, and 2 Enchanted Platinum Bars and I will forge them into a reward for you. <br>You say, 'What about the Devout?'<br>Gavel the Temperant says 'Nebbletob the Devout was once a slave in the mines of Meldrath, the Minotaur Sentry there was particularly cruel to him. He was in the expedition to Everfrost when Brother Theo drown. When trying to rescue Theo he came upon some caves under the river and narrowly escaped death when a great white beast attacked him. He never saw what the beast was, but it shredded his pack where he kept his icon.
