LOL!  This must have been the (name that melee/hybrid class) that was sitting in:<p>Lower Guk<br>Sol B<br>Mistmoore<br>etc<br>etc<br>etc<p>for hours shouting for a group.  But he's made no friends because it's always someone elses fault (whatever is- dying, not getting enough loot, getting KS'd).  Then he shoots his mouth off and can never find a group.  Meanwhile, I enter the zone and even when there are none of my full list of friends on, just call out "Cleric looking for a group" and get a group within 5 minutes.<p>Must be frustrating for ya, huh?<p>Try being a little more courteous, and oh, by the way, at least have the balls to put your real name so when you ask for a group I can laugh at you some more!
