<I><br>: How is a DE Cleric suppose t oget around? What I know.. he is pretty much KoS everywhere he goes! That means being trapped in. How can I avoid being KoS in Rivervale, Freeport, and the other places around my hometown? Don't give me the answer go kill stuff for faction because I have no time for that. Ohh yeah.. where should I fight atlvl 10+ (wish he had a cleric guide link :o)<br></I><br>got that nice old summoned magic hammer, introduce it to a few wisps.  verant designed said wisp with the thought that anyone fighting them wouldn't be able to do his normal amount of damage against them, and so a white/black conning wisp will be more easily killable by you than the same conning version of any other live creature (hope that made sense).  anyway, once i got that magic hammer, i abandoned first floor befallen and went and got me some wisps in W. Commons as well as the occasional bear/cat/snake/spider when the wisp supply was low.  that got me to level 12 or 13 when i went back into befallen and hit second floor.  i had a lot more success in all of these areas teaming with my monk roommate than soloing, so maybe be on the lookout for a partner.<p>-OrkinMan
