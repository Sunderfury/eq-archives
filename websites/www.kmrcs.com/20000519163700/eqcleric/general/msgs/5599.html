KK,<br>These Items replace rubicate, so, they are gonna cost an arm and a leg to get.  Now I'm not sure the cost of rubi on 'live' servers being I am only on test, but I venture to say 3-4 digits depending on the item.  Second, don't plan on getting them any time soon, items on test took several days to slip into a spawn because people (like me) camp them.  Only way to get them.  And well, when your server has 5x the amount of people as mine does, your screwed.  Finally, they look kewl.<p>Gluck Live Server People.<p>Tester<br>(27humclr)<br>
