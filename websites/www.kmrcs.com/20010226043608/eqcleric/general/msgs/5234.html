I know Lunara got her ingot the moment the server went up the second time, which i guesstimate to be around 1:30 pm est, and you got yours at 8:30 pm est, so the respawn time is around 7-8 hours for that ingot...how wonderful.<p>The diary probably has the same respawn time, and the location is the hut along the right hand zone wall (if you zone from Western Commons) I only remember that the first loc is approx 1730, but just stick at that and run along the zone wall and you will come upon a burned down hut.<p>I hope to retrieve these items for the second time today when the server goes up after the shutdown, as verant seems to have a minor bug within the quest (IE if you give them both the ingot and the icon, they consider the quest closed because she said "Wear these with pride!", even if you give them the wrong number of plat bars, which screwed me over...did a /petition, and of course, the guide couldnt help, but asked me to do a /bug and email questhelp@verant.com about it...but given the time they will probably take to reply, and that the answer i will get will most likely be "Sorry, we cant do anything" - camping the items again will probably be easier...heh) so i can get my pair of boots.<br>(If you snag the diary before me, i'm gonna hafta strike you down with wrath band! =)<p>Apparently Lunara got the necro down in befallen as well, but he seems to be a rare spawn (Remember Gynok anyone? =) so timing him will be a tad hard.

: The diary probably has the same respawn time, and the location is the hut along the right hand zone wall (if you zone from Western Commons) I only remember that the first loc is approx 1730, but just stick at that and run along the zone wall and you will come upon a burned down hut.

: I hope to retrieve these items for the second time today when the server goes up after the shutdown, as verant seems to have a minor bug within the quest (IE if you give them both the ingot and the icon, they consider the quest closed because she said &quot;Wear these with pride!&quot;, even if you give them the wrong number of plat bars, which screwed me over...did a /petition, and of course, the guide couldnt help, but asked me to do a /bug and email questhelp@verant.com about it...but given the time they will probably take to reply, and that the answer i will get will most likely be &quot;Sorry, we cant do anything&quot; - camping the items again will probably be easier...heh) so i can get my pair of boots.

: Also, have anyone found the guy in Highpass Hold?

: And yet another thing, maybe we should move this thread to the new test board? Easier to keep track of it there as this thread will go lower and lower as more people post.
