: Maybe I am too picky, but cripes am I dissapointed with the kind of crap and attention we get in this game. EQLizer recently posted our &quot;Sacred&quot; armor and in my opinion its crap.

: The chest is about the only thing I'd want, and it would be SECOND to my Rubicite.

: If you want to get really pissed off, look at the other classes PoF armor and do an honest comparison.

: I, for one, will never go to the PoF now. And its not because they nerfed it(nother story), its because we have no reason too if thats our best stuff. I have no desire die there, possibly not recovering my corpse which in my opinion ALREADY HAS the best stuff on it.

: Sure, a piece or two has &quot;OMG, ITS WISDOM!&quot; appeal, but compare our few gems to the hundreds of fantastic items already dedicated to and more suited for all the other classes WITHOUT going to the PoF.

: 
: Ever seen shiverback for monks? Hell yea I'd be ther in a minute if I were a monk.

: How about Valorium? Nice Chit! Id risk going If I were a Paladin.

: Thorny Vine? Makes rangers salivate at the thought.

: (Im gonna ask a question now that I'll answer later. Why do other classes look forward these items, or any items at all for that matter?)

: &quot;So Psomm, I hear ya bitching but I don't see any suggestions on how to fix it. I mean, we can't go putting high +wis on every piece of PoF armor available for you healers. Besides, you only get a point of mana after your wisdom is over 200 anyways (oops, did I say that?). So what can we do? Please Psomm, enlighten us.&quot;

: Glad to do so and here it is: GET BACK TO THE BASICS.

: We dont want &quot;All powerful&quot;. We want variety, some spice in our (Can I get a res and thanks for the heal) life. Were boring as hell to play anyways when compared to all the other classes; buffing constantly, healing, medding, and not much else. 

: Thats it. No more explanation needed. 

: &quot;You cant be serious Psomm. All that rant just to say you want variety?&quot;

: Is it really so hard to imagine that we'd love to find something clerical other than Plus wisdom? We know our job is to heal. We know we provide the most vital function to keeping the pulls coming and the live living. So is that ALL we're EVER to look forward too?

: +wis +wis +wis +wis?

: Now I'll answer the question I posed earlier.

: Other classes look forward to their items because the items themselves dont define their role.

: A monk looking for that lightweight strength belt might mean a better ac, more hits, higher damage. But is it better than the Dexterity or Agility belt? Maybe a combp of one or the other.
: [Our AC means nothing. We dont(or shouldnt) melee and damage from melee means nothing. +Wisdom will fix that.]

: A fighter can't choose between his executioners axe or 2 polished grantite tomahawks. One makes him faster, the other gives him strenght. He'll trial with them for months trying to decide whats best, and then try even more weapon combos. Damage, speed, procs, and other available weapons will all be factors in his changing decisions.
: [We dont melee and our weapon choice is slim to prove the point. Speed, Damage, procs, and available weapons for the most part is useless thinking for us. +Wisdom will fix that.]

: Casters have such neat spells for so many occasions. They can even research to discover more. Some can teleport all over the world and some have pets do their bidding. Their weapon choice may add HP or int or mana, may poison or burn or shatter or shield.
: [We get the same line of buffs varying only in mana consumption and speed plus some number. We get the same line of heals varying only in mana consumption and speed plus some number. We get the same line of non used AOEs and DD varying only in mana consumption and speed plus some number. We dont even look for weapons anymore because we're conditioned for... you guessed it - +Wisdom]

: I can make these same comparisons to each and every class but I'm too damn tired to continue. I've done my research and Im right about it. Its not about WHO can do WHAT(like im a fighter and I cant gate), its about WHO can do WHAT in their own little world.

: Variety. 
: Think about it. 
: Tell me what you think.

: I thank you for reading.

: Psomm, the Mentalist...
