: Yeah, I live with my girlfriend, and she asks me to do stuff and the stupidest time, like in the middle of a great group in SolB or LGuk... She say, just pause the game!  I am like WTF, shut the hell up woman, you dont understand,  you just dont LOG OUT in the middle of a group!  (Especially in the Savant Room or somewhere awkward to camp like that).  But, I still love her cuz yesterday I found the stump in Kith, and went to go rent a movie while I waited for the stupid ingot to spawn and left my monitor targeted on the stump.  Well, I watched all of Prince of Egypt (yeah I know it's gay, but my girlfriend want to watch it with me), and no ingot, I got restless and said "Screw it, I am gonna go get exp.  She was like, NO, you stand there, you have already waited 3 hours!  So after 30 mins of arguing I decided to pop in a REAL movie, (The Matrix) and lo and behold, about halfway thru the movie, I turn my head to look at the monitor and nearly piss my pants... THE INGOT!  HELL YES!  he he... So I did some more mindless running around and hugged my girlfriend for being a bitch and making me stay, and missed the last half of the Matrix, oh well, the damn server is down now, so I guess i will watch the rest now.. heh<p>: -Bandayd Woundmender, owner of 2 ingots and in need of the !@$!@$!@#%$#^$ icons!!!!!  heh.<br>: : Isn't it funny how they always time it so that you are just in the middle of something - your group is in a big battle or you are on the boat getting close to the docks or something similiar - how strange - oh well.

I did manage to gain just over 1 bubble of xp last night in about 1 1/2 hours so I'm feeling it was better spent levelling then running around all over and not having anything to show for it.

The guantlets seemed to be fairly decent, but the boots seem to be a waste of time in my opinion.  Is it just me or what?  I don't have any plan to even attempt to do any of these quest in the near future.  Perhaps someday (a month or 2) down the road I might give some thought to doing these quests or such, but I just don't feel that the items are worth all of the hassle that I've been hearing from other clerics about the wait and trying to find the NPC's and that kinda stuff.<p>: : : : : : Course that's just my personal opinion.<p>
