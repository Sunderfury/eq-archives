Most important difference missed between Guard and Spirit Armor. Guard is MUCH faster! And is a little bit stronger the Spirit Armor.<p><br>: Guard is level based and will get better as you go up levels.  It is a very inefficient spell to cast and I rarely use it, each spell in the line gets more mana inefficient so using the lowest you can is generally the most conservative way to go.<p>: None of the Armor line of spells compare favorably with the Valor line of spells and I would only cast them after using that buff.<p>
