Believe it or not I soloed most of my cleric's career.  I am now level 21 (almost 22) and have grouped some but also soloed alot.  I have heard MANY people say that clerics CAN'T solo but its just not true.  When I hunted in Oasis I took on Dry Bone skellies that conned yellow to me and soloed them with only losing one bub of health.  It can be done, and not just with undead stuff.  You just need to know where and what you can take =)<p>Ziggi,<br>Healer of Tunare,<br>Veeshan
