this thread has nothing to do with racial abilities...I am proud of what a Dark Elf gets in that dept, heck I even think the stats are pretty nice, our wisdom isnt sky high but we certainly don't need to put anything into agility.  The concern is that there are zero(ie..nada, nunca, "0") quests for a dark elf cleric weapon..and if anyone even mentions the Thex Mallet, come on get real? A. not even a Cleric only quest<br>      B. its stats are worse than the first summoned hammer we get at level 9<p>you know what people use the thex mallet quest for? to raise thier faction so they can get a ring of the dead...gee clerics don't need that either..hmmmmm.<p>On the other side of the light/dark coin: Screaming Mace, Shining Star of Light, Bloodforge hammer, and as a nice bonus...a weapon for all the litlun clerics called bullsmasher, and now the Butcherblock Hammer.  That's the disparity...we don't have any darn weapons we can quest for at all.  Setting "fair is fair" aside..it just doesn't make any sense now does it?<br>Why dont the Clerics of Innoruuk have some decent questable weapons since they are supposedly the most beloved of all his "children".  And I don't think that a dynamic quest will solve the problem, what DE clerics need is a quest that's doable in thier hi teens or early 20's that will give them a weapon comparable to screaming mace...to me that would make sense AND be fair.  Heck you can give the good races another weapon i don't really care...just give the Dark Elves one.  I imagine the good races will scream against it though..as that means they will basically lose the 100pp or so that some poor DE cleric has to pay to get a screaming mace from them.  My two coppers on this subject anyways.<p>Tilrey Soulkeeper
