If someone is upset that you won't drop your party to run to their corpse, suggest that the cleric in their party help them out.  If their party lacks a cleric, maybe they should consider having one!  Our primary loyalty has to be to our group -- then our friends/guild -- and if we can work in other people, great!  But we are not responsible to help everyone in the zone all the time -- that is an unrealistic expectation...<br>Just my 2 cp,<br>Erondil
