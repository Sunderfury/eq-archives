We can solo effectively, but the gains are not anywhere near the experience/loot as when we are grouped.  When I have solo's after 30+ I feel like a warrior with all the down time I have. 27-28 were the worst for this, but we really can solo.<p>I can solo a HG or SG pretty easily now, but then I'll go afk for 5 minutes to regain mana.  That's just really not all that much fun :)  I hunt Specs and HGs mostly for fun now.  We take a few friend and clear zones of giants/spectres/other baddies.  That way everyone shares experience, down time is minimal, and you get to interact with others.
