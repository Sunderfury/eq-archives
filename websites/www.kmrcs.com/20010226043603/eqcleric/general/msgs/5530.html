: This new quest armor was designed to be class specific replacements for Rubicite.  Period.

: If you look at the statistics from the armor the OTHER classes who are &quot;BENEFITTING&quot;,, bards, rangers, shamans,, thier stuff IS BETTER than Rubicite.  

: Throw in the fact, that these OTHER classes are cranking our thier new rubi replacements, as if they were on an assembly line,  AND they're better of for it.

: We've only seen 2 pieces of the new cleric armor, & it's only because it was completed during the TEST phase.   Of these 2 pieces,, they're NOT the equal of Rubicite.  In the 2 examples, it's BARELY better than BRONZE!

: Am I grateful that we have new quests?? Sure... But, thier lack of foresight, has me not even caring about these quests.  THAT's inexcusible.

: Give a client a new product, that's not even as good as it's replacement... HAHAHA.
