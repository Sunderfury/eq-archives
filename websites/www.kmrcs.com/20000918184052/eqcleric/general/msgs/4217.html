: Agrippa If you are KOS to the ogre, take care for they will come if they watch you hide your head in mountain far away.  My 34 druid friend is killed just by taking a look.

: It's dangerous camp since they can sow, root, hit and 7+ ogres there.  Zone line is very far away and the zone is large like ocean of tear.  If you can't take it you are dead or soccored.

: I am not KOS there.. strange for I take them several times and killed hundreds of Najena Ogres.
