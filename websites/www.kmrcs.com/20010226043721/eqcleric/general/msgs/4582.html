: : : now they've got cleric-only armor on the Plane of Fear and it is useable by the following races : Human, Erudite, Half-Elf, High Elf, and Dwarf.

: : : this means one of a few things :

: : : Verant has decided that this armor is of size medium and decided that Dwarves can use it anyway
: : : Forgotten that the other races even exist
: : : Screwed up again on something that should be so easy
