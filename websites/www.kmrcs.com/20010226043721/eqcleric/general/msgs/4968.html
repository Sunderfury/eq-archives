It's me the little Dwarven warrior again.  I have been fighting in CB for several levels now, and the only times I ever run are when I see "soandso shouts DVINN TO ZONE!".  The group I have been in have on numerous occasions pulled multiple orc legionarres(spelling?) this being back when I was level 10 and legs still conned red.  Generally our casters (including the druids when we had one) would well for the group to run.  But me and the cleric would stay and yeah I would have some bad rounds but nothing horrible, and since the cleric saved his mana for healing (rather than nuking) and seeing as how heals can't be resisted the only thing the cleric had to worry about was fizzles which happens about 1 in 50 casts for him.  So, me and the cler hold our ground and actually take one of the beasts down and then the group realizes that, hey, maybe we can take this fight.<p>One time I remember clearly camping the castle gate and our puller had a bad pull.  We ended up fighting 4 legs an emmisary and a few cents for good measure with a group of level 11s.  Of course the wiz and puller told the group to run but I decided to stay and fight.  So I started attacking the closest leg with the cleric helping with the melee and healing me.  Eventually the group did realize that we were ok so decided to jump back in and we actually managed to kill all of the orcs that were pulled.  Now, to me,  this seems to be a rather hairy situation but me and the cleric actually managed to salvage the situation without a single death in the group.<p>And just so you know even when me and the cleric both know that it is a hopeless fight I am still the last to run.  I try to get all the mobs agroed on me so the casters can manage to gate out and those that can't gate can make it to the zone.  That is the second main use for a warrior holding the line of retreat.<p>So, in conclusion why take a druid in a group.  Everything they get can be done better by another class.  They are the proverbial jack of all trades and master of none.  Now, don't get me wrong, they are a nice addition to a group, but they will *NEVER* replace a good cleric.  I mean I am generally in a full group with a cleric and wiz or magician or enchater (oftens more thatn one mage class) so why would I want to bring in someone who can do a little bit of everything but not as well.  Anyways, that's just my opinion.  But, hey what do I know.  I'm just a dumb warrior.<br>(for that matter have played tank classes exclusively (including 3 warriors))<br>
