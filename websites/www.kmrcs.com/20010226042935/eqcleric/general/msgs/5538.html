: I will agree that some camps are not fun, that trying to hunt some roaming mabs is not fun.  I personally think that adding the new quests was a step backwards.

: Camping can be alot of fun, putting yourself in a spot where you have an opportunity for a good fight and maybe some nice loot.   The problem is not camping, the problem is that things are camped, does this make sense?

: Example:  Six players move into Unrest and want to get some boots from the Ghost.  There is no one else in the zone.  They camp the ghost.  The kill it a number of times and have good luck to get a pair of boots.  All the fights are tough and the party just barely makes it through some of them, very one is having a blast.

: Okay, perfect picture.  That is what Verant was looking to happen, the design of the game.  So what's the problem?  The problem is Group B who enters the zone and wants to camp it.  Now you have one group having a good time and the other group waiting to have a good time.  My Point is that Camping and Waiting are not the same issue.   It is a blast to camp a spot, it is not a blast to wait for the opportunity to camp.

: Lets investigate what causes the waiting problem.
: 1) Overcrowded Servers - Thats an easy one, the EQ world is simply too small for 1500 players
: 2) Maturing Servers - As the average level increases, the world gets smaller.  Just ask the next level 40 player where he can hunt.
: 3) Too few places to Camp - Lots of places could be added in existing zones that players could camp
: 4) No-Drop - No-Drop items reduce the number of that specfic item in the market (with a few exceptions) forcing a line of people to go camp an item.
: 5) Harvesters - High level players camping low level spots for items to sell.  Verants first attempt (and really one of the few design mistakes they have made) was to adopt the no-drop policy which was in and of itself another problem.
: 6) Static Item Placement - I think this one is here to stay, I have yet to see an answer that worked.  Random Mobs are worse than Static ones.

: Do I have all the answers to solve the waiting problem?  Nope.  I do have a few.

: 1) Get rid of no-drop, just an all around bad idea.  Hurts the player economy, promotes camping, makes some camp spots less desirable moving more players to the good spots.
: 2) Add many many more places to camp.  Lessor Faydark could easily hold a whole hive of bees with 2 or 3 nice loot items.
