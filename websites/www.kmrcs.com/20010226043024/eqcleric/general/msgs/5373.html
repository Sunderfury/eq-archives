I would hate to see things split up by server.  Then people would only read the groups for their server because it would take forever to check all of them.  It would make it that much harder to share useful information and insights.  Plus I don't think the group is large enough for that but Rayne would know that best.<p>Just my two cents,<br>Torin of FeninRo<br>
