Or how about when 40 people gather to kill a dragon and the dragon drops four items.  What about the other 36 people?  Then the exp ONLY goes to the "killing" group.

It makes no sense not to have some way to allow more than 6 players to group. <br>I would rather see singular powerful rather than more less powerful items.
