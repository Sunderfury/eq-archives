: My ranger has killed enough crag spiders to get several levels out of them, from which I've learned:

: Spiders are linked.  However, after the carrions become very green to you, they won't hop in to assist, just as any linked mobs won't.

: Even after killing hundreds of crags, they still aren't agro to me.  When you gated, where you bound in zone?  If so, then it's aggression list wasn't cleared.  If you did zone to clear it's aggression list, then perhaps it was fluke or some change added to the recent patch?
