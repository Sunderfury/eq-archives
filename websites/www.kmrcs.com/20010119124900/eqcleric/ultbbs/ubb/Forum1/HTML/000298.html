</FONT><HR>With the addition of the new armor, shield, and weapon, I'm a tank again!  For sacrificing 15 wisdom I've gained a huge amount of AC, dex, agility, and strength.<P>Last night we went down into Lower Guk and I was testing out my new stuff.  The monsters couldn't hit me!  They were missing 90% of the time and when they hit, the only did about 20 or so damage.  With an AC of 625, it's actually higher than monks I know of the same level.  I was tanking everything, even the giant ice boned skeletons who can double hit for 70.<P>The tanks were having trouble hitting some monsters like Vampire Bats but a lot of times I would get a hit off.  So they would whiff 2 or 3 time out 4 attacks and WAM I would hit too.  That means I was doing about 25 to their 30 to 50 damage.  Not so bad considering that I don't have double attack, dual wield, or weapon skill bonus.  The monk actually asked me to come over and finish off a bat that just wouldn't die by meleeing it!<P>I was using Expel left and right to test out the armor and just having a ton of fun.  I never even noticed the wisdom loss!  The other cleric was primary healer so I could test and he was doing fine.  I didn't realize until later that he only had 114 wisdom!  He almost always had enough but he did spend most of his time medding.  I did have to stop blasting at about 2 bubbles to make sure we were safe and I had enough for heals.<P>I learned something that night.  I believe it was in Ghost in the Shell that said "To much specialization is a slow death.  We become too predictable."  If you concentrate on wisdom, of course you're gonna suck when fighting!  You turn yourself into a portable bandaid, not your class.  It's not important how much mana you have, it's important to have ENOUGH mana.  Big difference.<P>Now, I'm not going to turn into a full blasting, fighting, tanking wizard, but you better believe I'm the Combat Medic!<P>Stop letting the numbers and other people dictate who you are and go be who you want to be.<P>------------------<BR>Akane Milak<BR>Priestess of Erollisi Marr (Queen of Nub)<BR>35 Armadillos<BR>Cazic-Thule Server<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Having some fun going into heavy melee is no sin but lets not get away from the fact that clerics do not compete well in combat with true melee types.<P>15 wisdom at your level is 105 mana, that is a HUGE amount of mana.  That is almost enough mana to cast a 270 point expel undead which is probably more damage than you will do with your weapon.  Further, during the combat, you could probably meditate and cast the spell twice; doing much more damage than with your weapon and still having more mana than you have with your current item configuration.<P>My AC is just over 700, I get hit alot.  With buffs I could get into the 730 range, I still get hit alot.  Getting triple hit for 116 is not my job, whacking a Frenzied ghoul for 17 points with my mace is not my job, having enough mana for a heal is my job.<P>I would have to disagree with your ascertain that a level 35 Cleric with a 114 wisdom is doing fine.  I would say that cleric is at least 250+ mana below the normal and is thus a liability (these types of liabilities can be overcome by exceptional players but few exceptional players place themselves in such a position). <P>------------------<BR>------------------<BR>Segal SoulSaver<BR>50th Circle of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'd have to say that I agree with Segal.  I know there is no possible way I can compete with the tanks in my group.  I don't try.  If I wanted to be a tank that could heal, I would have played a paladin.<P>I'm currently at 180 wis with probably another 100 mana from items.  There are still several slots that I have not filled with items that give wis.  Do I use all of my mana in one battle?  Usually not.  However, because I usually have 60-80% left over, it allows the puller to pretty much autopull.  That means hardly any downtime!  And that in a three party group holding rooms that an full party my level has had to run from.<P>If your strategy works for you, though, that's great!  Not all clerics are the same.  Having fun is the most important thing and I think you've found a combination that makes you happy.<P><P>------------------<BR>Lucretia Rialsq<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Bristlebane <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Both sides have valid arguements. <P>I'm a human, w/ approx 154 wisdom. But, I've also got a pretty handy AC.<P>I liked your line regarding specialization. I think it's key to be able to do both.  Just the other night, I was grouped w/ a Druid & a Necro in Cazic.   Of course, I was tanking & pulling & healing where necessary.<P>I think they key is to be able to fill BOTH roles.  I've refused to give up AC, to get +3 wisdom.  <P>As it is, I've been lucky enuf to strike a blend of both AC & Wisdom.<P>------------------<BR>Tomma Trueheart<BR>Priestess of Mithaniel Marr, 28th Rosary<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Let's face it; the cleric is a jack of all trades type of class.  The player's mind set and the composition of the party often dictate the tactics and equipment used.  The type of mobs being encountered also may affect the clerics choice of equipment/spells.  <P>My most successful parties have had me playing the roll of a primary healer to a balanced group of tanks and casters  More mana is always desired, but the cleric can expect a mob to make an end run around the tanks every once in a while.  Don't leave your armor at home.  <P>I have also taken the roll of secondary healer when another cleric was available.  My tasks in this situation include buffing, rooting, healing after the battle, or during a pitched battle when the primary healer runs out of mana and has to meditate.  High mana is always good, but extra AC is nice since fighting early on is often prudent.<P>A third roll I have seen is that of a Nuker/Healer.  This is only done when the party is Tank heavy.  Give me a very high Wisdom over AC in this situation.  Buffs, roots, and heals often leave a cleric reading his book.<P>The obvious forth roll is that of the combat healer.  The cleric tanks, and even pulls, for a caster heavy party.  This is my least favorite role due to the poor melee potential of the cleric.  Gimme the AC when in this roll.  The casters better be big guns because it is hard to cast heal when the combat healer is being beat upon.<P>The last roll of a cleric is that of the solo cleric.  The solo cleric has to blend and balance all that I've mentioned above, including AC and Wisdom.<P>I guess my point is this: Every equipment/spell selection made is situational.  Think about what you are doing, and then carry it out.<P>------------------<BR>Bolaldil Balmsoul<BR>Temple Of Life<BR>Server Erollisi Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Cleric's have their tanking uses, but to play them as a tank is to cheat the party of valuable service. When there are more melee mobs than tanks, I like to cast Force (88 damage stun) on the extra. When it wears off the mob will hit me, while I focus on the main mob the party is on. I'm able to keep it off the party, thus, while still casting. As for melee damage...go try to solo something super green without using any DD spells. You'll find that you can't beyond level 20 or so. It simply can't be done. I've been out of mana and taken 5 minutes to finish a blue mob at less then a quarter of a bubble of its HP.  We absolutely suck at melee.<P>Given the choice...I'll take all the wis I can get up to 200, as long as it doesn't cost me a reduction in carry or str. I gave away a dagnar's +18 wis -9 totem (dolly) to my druid pal in lieu of my charred guardian (+9wis) shield, for AC and appearance. [I dont carry dollies....sorry <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif">]  I recommend medding as much as possible (as opposed to melee) whenever you have genuine tanks to do the tanking, and nukers to do the nuking.

</FONT><HR>I've been trying to pound the idea of not overbalancing one stat to all manner of druids.  Some get it, some don't and just go on and on about how much more wisdom they have.  There is something wrong with their argument when two equal level druids duel each other and the one who has added to his STR, AGI, DEX, and kept an eye on AC as well as WIS beats the druid with 20 more wisdom to their name.  Not only that, but the druid with the lower wisdom has time to sit, memorize cancel magic and dispel the DOT that the other druid put on them.  Still has more than a full bubble of life too.  <P>The point is not how much of one attribute you have.  A warrior who blows off everything else for STR may be able to deal massive damage, but if he has no AC he's going to get pounded into the turf in a few hits.  Monks who specialize in just AGI aren't getting hit much, but the monsters seem to take forever to die.  The idea is to try to raise as many stats as you can.  Carefully weigh one thing against another before tossing the old away.  There can be a balance, and the AC you save today may spare your life long enough to get off one more heal tomorrow.<P>By now, many of you are wondering why I mentioned druids when this is a cleric board.  Well, druids go out and max their WIS too.  They feel they can't tank too.  They think they can't deal damage with a weapon, so carry some book instead.  Basically, they do the same thing as you.<P>If you want to truly consider whether you can do something, you have to look at it more accurately.  People say they can't deal damage that competes with a warrior.  Well, you are forgetting that warriors can't toss in a spell while they are fighting something.  That has to be included.  A weapon in the hands of a character whose skill has been kept up to snuff is an effective DOT.  I may only hit 10 times instead of 30-40 in a fight.  But if each hit is 20points, that's 200damage total.  Along with those few big spells you got off, you can do 1000 total damage in a little under what a warrior can.  And 200 damage with a weapon often means 150 less mana you spend.<P>This games has some checks and balances.  but if you don't balance now and then, you just get checked.  And I can tell you, I do not want to be bashed into the side of a hockey rink by anything in Kithicor.  Have fun, carry two sets of gear if you like switching roles, and keep yer sticks on the ice.<P>Oh, I do know what I'm talking about.  I play a cleric as well as a druid.

</FONT><HR><BR>I agree with Akane. Staring yourself blind at "I must have 200 wisdom" is simply not the whole truth. AC, stats and resistances are all important factors. <P>Since meditation will bring back a certain amount of mana every tick, more mana will require more meditation to get filled up.<P>This implies that every time you are not FM you are essentially throwing away all the extra wisdom. <P>It also implies that you will only be able to heal a certain amount of damage every time unit, regardless of your wisdom.<P>Higher AC and resistances -will- make you take less damage though, thus decreasing your own healing downtime.<P>I'm not saying that throwing away the +wis is something that we should strive towards, but at my level (mid 35) I am not prioritizing wisdom in a way that cuts down vastly on other things. I have 143 +- a couple of points depending of if I use 1hb or 2hb. I use a bloodstained mantle instead of a lizardscale mantle because of the nice +10 mr for example. <BR>I have around 645 AC with guard and good resistances (very important on a PvP server).<P>Besides I am having fun when I whack a monster for 35 points of damage with my tainted teir'dal staff, and I feel alive when I take a few hits in combat :-). And I've never ever heard complaints that I run out of mana too quickly. If you run out of mana it's because of your play style, not your low wisdom. <P><BR><P>------------------<BR>Mirixia Elamshinae<BR>High priestess of Innoruuk<BR>Black Sun, Vallon Zek<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well I can see everyones standpoint here.  And i have to first off agree, its what you find enjoyable what works for you personally.  <P>I have said it before, I am not into AC items.  The last thing i want and try and let happen is a mob hitting me.  Between Force, Holy might, enstill, atone, trying to lead it onto a tank, anything to prevent me doing any kind of tanking.  <P>It we would be far more beneficial to my party I feel if a tank had 2 mobs on it, and only could do one at a time, at least I can keep them alive.  <P>If i ever try to solo, which is rare, AC is the absolute last thing I want as well.  I would rather have that added wis for a Wrath.  <P>I find it really pathetic when I try to melee something, and its more frustrating than anything.  Although I will admit, when i need to fight soemthing, That Tainted tier'dal staff works really well.  Hitting for 39 a pop (when i land one that is hehe) helps a bit =)  <P>Binge - Brell Serilis<BR>Dwarven Cleric<BR>Legio Draconis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>A mid to high level cleric soloing for exp should be far far more concerned about having max mana than about ac and such. If your a mid to high level cleric, and you don't have enough mana to root and nuke a /con blue MOB to death, you may as well zone, because I don't care what your equipment is, it will tear you up in melee. Same goes for group action. My response to having a MOB frenzy on me in a group situation has always been to root/enstil/imobalize it and step away, if its several thing and I am going down fast, I use divine barrier till the tanks get stuff off me. Sorry, there isn't any equipment in the game that will make me able to live for long with 2 dars and a bok ghoul hitting me, may as well just root and step away. As far as melee gos, ROFLAMO, forget it, over the corse of a fight I can use stun series spells, heal, med, and occasionaly pop a nuke on somthing that is low, and be far more effective and efficient than any amount of my pathetic cleric melee can do, I didn't even own a weapon for 20 levels untill I did the quest for the Caduceus. If its low pressure stuff, sure, be a blattle cleric, its fun, but for hard group action, or soloing for exp, your only detracting from your effectivness and the effectivness of the group by getting up there and meleeing, hell, you may even be blocking your groups rouge from backstabing a fleeing MOB for 100+ damage so you can get your little hit for 20 and your 4 wiffs in.<BR>The primary things I look for in items, are increases in my mana, via +wis or +mana, increases to resistances, primarily magic, cold and heat, and looks. Ac is the least of my concerns. =)<BR>Everyone has their own play style, thats fine, mine makes me happy, keeps me alive, and keeps my groups alive in situations that others fail, so I think I'll stick with it. =)<P>Caleal P`Terak<BR>Priest of Innoruuk<BR>Cazic-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>  Well lemme start by saying that I love my AC and I do like to fight melee style when the time is right.<P>  To the earlier poster who said that clerics can't fight beyond level 20 or so in pure melee I can say with certainty that the statement is Bull****. I have a level 27 cleric and fought a cinder goblin that conned blue to me in Solusk's Eye and I decided to try my luck by meleeing it without the use of my DD spells.  Well without even one heal I can clearly say that I KICKED IT'S ARSE!!!  <P>  I had two blocks of health left over and destroyed that pitiful bastard so bad that he went running home to mommy.<P>  I by no means am encouraging everyone to go do this, because you have to have the right equipment and stats for the job, but it can easily be done and I saved a LOT of mana by not blasting the gob with multiple smite spells and roots.  Plus it also felt good to know that the Twiggmeister still has the melee touch when it counts!    <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif"><P>  Oh and for the earlier poster that said if you have less wisdom because of higher AC that you're a liability, I only have to say to that poster that I feel sorry for you. If you're looking to powerplay and ultra wis yourself out, then by all means go ahead. But if you want to roleplay and wear the nice looking armor sometime then perhaps you'll enjoy the fun of the game more and not the "efficiency" of it.  If this point was not the intention of your post then I apologize for the semi flame post I'm giving here.<P><BR>-Twigg Bramblefoot, Drunken Cleric of the    27th Circle and official morale officer for the Evoluxa Guild.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000015&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Caleal, i tend to disagree on soloing and AC. High AC helps me out alot. Although i dont solo alot, when i do, getting hit is what causes the most problems for me, not running low on mana. Higher AC means you get hit less. Therefore more likey to get that root off when being pounded on. I've said it many times before, and i will say it again. Thinking back over my 50 levels i can say that I (or party members) have died very, very few times because i was OOM. The few instances were being OOM did cause deaths were bad pulls or trains...etc. Have enough for an extra heal would not have saved us. I feel i can safetly say that my high AC has saved me (and party members) many more times. Mainly in the form of getting spells off with a monster on me. Sure, in the idea situation a cleric isnt going to take hits. But we all know thats not how things always go down. I can think just 2 nights ago where i think my AC saved me. We were a little ways in the PoH when the entire zone repopped. Things got nasty incredibly fast. Our tank had 3 mobs on him and his health was dropping like a stone. No time to try rooting or stunning, which even if there was time would probably get resisted anyways. If he didnt get a heal right then he was down. So i healed him and of course the 2 unengaged mobs jumped on me as our evacer was casting. If i didnt have my high AC i would not have survived that encounter. I guess im of the mindset of planning for the worse (i.e. im gonna get mobs pounding on me at some point). If this happens i am more prepared to stand in the line of fire than a cleric not concerned with AC. At 189 wisdom (and no mana stuff) i feel very confident that i can do my job as well as any other cleric in the game. I guess thats what it boils down to. If you feel that your equipment gives you the best opportunty to be a good cleric then your choices cant be wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think a number of posters are assuming that you cant max wisdom and still keep an eye on other aspects of your stats.  That is not correct for most players, I believe every player tries to maximize other stats all well as wisdom.<P>Mirixia made a good point about mana, your first point of mana is a heck of alot more valuable than your last point.  Many nights I play and am never at full mana, the speed of the pulls simply does not allow me to be there.  A high wisdom allows me to build a reserve of mana during the slower times for use when we really need it.<P>It is possible at the lower levels (<35) to melee some if you feel you need to.  At higher levels, you need AC and AGI purely for defense.  You are not concerned with hitting that BOK Froglock Ghoul for 18 points, you are concerned with rooting it so you can get the heck away from it.  If you are looking forward to being a tank at level 40 or 50, I would recommend a class change because you will find it very very difficult to tank.  <P>I personally dont believe it possible for me to melee a blue mob to death regardless of my equipment.  However, I can probably nuke them pretty good.<P>Twigg - reread my post, I said if you are a level 35 cleric with a 114 wisdom then you might be a liability.  Nothing in this thread has changed my thoughts on that.<P>BTW - I have 1670+ hours with one character, I have had great fun the whole time, took me 60 days played to get to 50 (that is by no means powerleveling).  I would place my roleplaying skills on par with anyone I have meet in game.  But since EQ is really a Fantasy Based Group Tactical Combat game, I stress those skills first.<P>------------------<BR>------------------<BR>Segal SoulSaver<BR>50th Circle of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>There are always two sides to the coin, but I believe it has alot to do with your starting race. I am a human cleric w/ about 154 wis. My base wisdom is 100. However, the only thing I have tried to do is balance +Wis items with LOOK =) It seems that the cool plate based armor is just too cool looking. In my quest to make my character look badass, I have seemed to balance AC and wis pretty good. I mean, I have almost everything +Wis item a level 32 can even fathom (RMBs, Gatorlegs, full plat jewelery, not like Ethereal mist and Golden efreeti =) But I mean my ac is a decent 584. Name of the game though is starting race. A dwarven or halfling cleric is much more suited to being a Combat Medic than a DE or High Elf. <P>Then again, you can only use what you can get. I am not twinked, and the highest in my guild is only 37, but my equip is WAY beyond my level (32). Obviously, if you can get that mithril set, you'd take it =)<P>Daeleon Everlight<BR>Xegony - Priest of Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000018&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ok. I'm hearing alot from both sides of the coin here.<P>Maybe this helps shed some light.<P>I've another cleric, which I stopped playing at level 18. He died trying to kill a ghoul.<P>Doesn't make alot of sense, right?<P>Well, I maxed him out on wisdom, but his str, sta, dex were far below standard.<P>He couldn't carry a full set of bronze and still be able to move. <P>On the other hand, I didn't max out my stats on this one, 100 at Str (good for carrying all the bronze + food and can still fight), not maxed in the wis department, but can cast enough heals or smites to keep the party alive, and himself alive.<P>I've found he is still able to tank blue things at 27 and not only live, but to solo them safely.<P>I've found a balance that works for me, and soon I'll have collected enough +wis items to make up the difference. I can say this, I could solo a carrion ghoul at 20, which left me with no mana and down at maybe 1/5 of my health, but I was able to do it, as well as solo not one, but two ghouls at 14 (Almost died from it, but lived, barely and was rooted for quite some time after - wasn't by choice either.. LOL) Took me until aqua goblin tidal lords turned blue for me to be able to solo one, and it was still risky until 24, but they can be soloed.<P>Right now, I'm working on +wis items as well as +agi and +sta items to make up for mana deficiencies and to be able to continue tanking without getting hurt so badly.<P>With all characters, the trick is finding the balance that works for you. I've found mine with this one, and am currently working on getting him up to a level where he really starts to shine. I don't expect to be tanking that much longer, but who knows? When he can no longer tank blue mobs, I'll figure out what's wrong there, and fix it if I can, and if not, stay with groups, as that is my real strength, as a team player.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000019&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Goodnes, many valid points here, but one I would like to stress which seems to be overlooked today.  I strongly feel, and this is from experience, that clerics hold the single greatest taunt in the game.  The power to heal will draw the attention, not only of your tank's target, but all the other things hitting him as well.  After taking a few deaths because my warrior couldn't taunt the three undead froggies off me, I made a decision that has made a dramatic difference in the number of deaths my party sustains.  I wear a black enamel breastplate instead of a bloodstained tunic.  Not only do I look better, but I can withstand the beating I'm forced to take.  Another thing to remember is that once you go down, other deaths are imminent.  I also wear a black pearl choker to increase agility and dexterity.  This prevents me from being hit as frequently when I'm forced into battle.  <P>Now, I rarely if ever engage my weopon, at the beginning of a battle, sure, but once I'm down to 75% mana, I sit.  I've become very proficient at sitting, and now that we can med and watch the fight, it's actually kinda fun.  One thing I must remind myself to do is when attacked, I must engage.  My one had blunt skill isn't too bad, and I actually suprised myself the other day by hitting for 21 with a weopon whose max damage is only 17.  I'm not sure if you've seen it yet, but check out eq.gamestats.com for the new cleric only weopon found on the Plane of Hate.  This weopon's stats are somewhere in the neighborhood of 11dmg/34dly, +7wis, and it cast BANISH undead (I think it also has some resistances).  Now, consider this.  You are not full mana, but you are not dangerously low, you are sitting anyway.  That weopon's proc will not fire unless that weopon is engaged. Thus no possible chance of hitting for 585 pts of damage at all.  I'm not saying to be the tank, and I'm not saying to become so incredibly low as to put your group in jeopardy.  All I'm saying is keep you skill up so you can be the wizzy we all dream of being.<P>Just another point of view.<P>Kalyope KrymsonHeart<BR>Cleric of Tunare, 44th Circle<BR>Tarew Marr<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Kalyope (edited 11-10-1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=000298.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=General+Board&TopicSubject=I|APO|m+a+tank+again!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">
