: That's life being a cleric, and it only gets much worse at higher levels. The only way to survive is to group with smarter tanks. Here are some things have kept me alive:

: They should of course only try to pull 1 mob at a time, 3 max, but we know this isn't always possible. (we all know this isn't always possible, but try to stress that anyway.)

: Have your tanks &quot;tag&quot; each mob in the battle,  this puts them on top of the sh!t list, and will usually by you a little bit of time.

: Don't heal too soon! In a big battle (more than 3) I won't heal til the target is below 50% health. Also, try to heal from a distance.

: Don't use your biggest heal. I save superior and complete heal for after the battle. Nothing pisses off a mob like healing your tank for 600+.

: Keep atone memmed. If you can atone whatever is beating on you, it makes it really easy for the tanks to get it off you.

: The tanks should pull mobs off of you asap. Make sure your tanks know that if you're engaged you can't heal them.

: If you need to, root the mobs on you off to the side somewhere. Hopefully they'll stay put til your tanks can start beating on it. (I use enstill for this, if you leave the mob alone after casting, it lasts a good long time.)
