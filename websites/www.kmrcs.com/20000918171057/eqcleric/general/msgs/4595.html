I would have said "you asked for help...I helped and you lived I saved you a half bubble or so of XP which is a hell of a nice thing to do.  But trust me now that I know you really don't want help I will not help again..."<p>Then you fight near them if possible and wait for them to get in trouble again (usually takes like 15 mins or less (morons aren't called morons for nothing).  Then you stand next to them as they die.  Then you  kill it and get the xp.<p>Usually this will lead to more insults then the first wave.  My response is to say "you said not to help you ever again....make up your mind" then /ignore monkey.<p>If they are in a group ask the entire group if they dismiss your help.  Hate for a couple of guys who needed to fill a spot die to the rude words of an idiot.  Perhaps tell them you can't help in the future until so and so is dead....
