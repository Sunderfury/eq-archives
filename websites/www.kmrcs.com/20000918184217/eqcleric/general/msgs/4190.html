: Zones in that range that are in need of clerics:

: Cazic! Cazic! Cazic! Every melee class wants rubi at this level (warriors get crafted, but everyone else doesn't), plus it's very good loot outside of the rubi.

: Permafrost (you usually have to recruit people to go here from other zones)- some good items here for monks, rangers, warriors, AND casters, but not many go here due to the travel involved and it's relatively unknown by peeps in the level range to get exp.

: Sol A!  Very few spend time gaining levels here.  Why I will never know.  Maybe it's the fear of going through Nek Forrest (uh oh- DE guards!  lol)  but there are great items and tons of experience here.  See Ferrick's guide to Sol A- this may draw some more people there, but this weekend on Tarew Marr there were a total of 9 peeps there.

If you can recruit a couple tanks and a caster away from here you would have a blast in Sol A.  Also kinda out of the way from the &quot;normal&quot; hunting grounds.  You could pick up a group getting done with Najena to group with, but I have never seen that happen.

: Mistmoore- horrible trains, but great experience here and very good loot.  Cleric is definately a necessity.  Grave Yard area is great at this level (keep gate memmed if you don't have an evac).

: Unrest- at this point there wasn't a lot that still gave good exp here, however, there are STILL items I would like to get from Unrest.

: Lower Guk- seen plenty of 30s come here and do good at the entrance or BR, but you may die too much until you grab a couple of levels.
