Resurrect is a high-level, group-<br>oriented spell that helps a party recover lost<br>members for reduced down-time.  Why?  Because at<br>high levels, they've EARNED it.  A high-level<br>group in a high-level dungeon can't afford to<br>be down one or more party members for long.  As<br>a reward for many levels of service, the cleric<br>gains the ability to summon his companions back<br>to their corpse.  As an added bonus, they also<br>begin to restore lost XP.  People that run around<br>/telling high-level clerics, asking for a Res are<br>simply buying a service, like buying a weapon, or<br>paying for a bind.  They need to get back to their<br>group as well, but of what concern is that to the<br>cleric?  It's only of concern to the cleric because<br>the economy of the game forces them to rely on it<br>for income, or their network of friends or guild<br>members imposes a sense of obligation.  There is<br>nothing that says that a cleric MUST run off to<br>resurrect anyone and everyone that has enough<br>sense to type /w all cleric and look at the levels<br>displayed.<p>: While playing in safe areas death is rare, corpse recovery is easy, as is getting a res in two hours wether you have a cleric in your party or not (at least compared to the alternative).<p>: If you/party has the gut's to go out and explore or hunt deeper into dungeons the risk of death increases 10 fold (harder to get out, more mobs to get through, generaly harder mobs, etc ....). This by it's very nature means you will die more, and will spend much more time (and often more challanging than the inital hunt) in corpse recovary.<p>You disprove your own point.  If you are venturing<br>into more dangerous areas, and take risks, you<br>are also assuming the responsibility and realizing<br>the possibility that you MIGHT NOT survive, and<br>further, you PROBABLY won't be able to retrieve<br>your corpse without outside assistance.<p>: For this more adventurous & fun risk we are know also saything that after dying and spending two+ hours in corpse recovary you will not even get exp back.<p>No, you are saying that you voluntarily got in<br>over your head, and you are accepting the <br>potential outcome, which may be that you will<br>permanently lose XP.<p>: Am I the only one who thinks this is backwards ?<p>It's not at all backwards.  When you opt for glory,<br>adventure and high risk, your payoff is also MUCH<br>higher than the payoff I get playing it safe.  You<br>just would like to have your cake and eat it too.<br>You want to have a chance at the big payoff (more<br>XP from kills, better money, nicer items in loot),<br>but won't accept the downside, which is that you<br>also stand to LOSE.

Why can't they put the same level of thought & effort into our cleric resurection spells ?<p>But they did.  What they did was nerf this spell<br>for the people that run around piling up corpses<br>and asking clerics to resurrect them.  What they<br>DIDN'T particularly nerf is the cleric that works<br>as part of a solid team, and can help out his<br>guildmates or groupmates.  At least, I feel this<br>was their intent, but it's been perceived in a<br>totally different light, and now will be seen as<br>nothing but another in a long line of poorly<br>designed nerfs.
