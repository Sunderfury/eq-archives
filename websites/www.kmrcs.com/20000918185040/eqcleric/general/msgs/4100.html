I am lvl 42 also. I can solo in Sol B as long as i stay near a zone. The Greater Kobolds are fairly easy. Just root and wrath. Shaman's are still too tough because they heal themselves. Also Lower Guk has an Undead side. I stay near the zone there and do the root and shoot also. Lower Guk is harder. Because it is more difficult to get one NPC alone.<p>: I cant find anyplace to solo, and its hard to find groups, plus i cant gate all around like wizes so im kinda stuck in an area.<p>
