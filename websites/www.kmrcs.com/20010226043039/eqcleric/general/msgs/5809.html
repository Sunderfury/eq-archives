The purpose of these new quests were for:<p>1.)  Put the "quest" back into everquest.  We know that for some classes this is true, for others it isn't.  Yes, clerics did get the shaft here as its more camp quest than ever.  <p>2.)  To create class specific armor because apparently Rubi was too generic.  Basically this means the result will be low to mid end armor to replace Rubi.  Rubi was simply AC, nothing more, nothing less (Unless you are talking about the BP).  Don't expect them to replace it with PoF armor.  Lets face it, the only rubi piece that was decent for clerics is the BP.  I honestly can't see many clerics wanting full Rubi sets in place of some +WIS armor for example.<p>3.)  Cash cows.  Verant wants to suck out PP from players as stated by Brad himself.  These quests help to do some of that.<p>When its all said and done, the bottom line on alot of the new quests is that it removes the FUN from EverQuest;  It increases camping, and increases hostility between players.  The patch simply contradicts itself in every way in what it was suppose to do.  Can you imagine people sitting around on a stump for 6-8 hours waiting for an object to spawn?  Talk about questing right ?  Considering the cleric armor is low to mid level in nature, it contradicts itself as a cash cow.  I believe these quests are geared for mid level players who really don't have all that money they can spend on it.  There is already cleric armor which is much better in the game.<p>Only advice I can give for people who aren't happy with the quests and the items you get from them; simply don't do the quests.  Verant's history shows they don't listen, nor do they have a clue about many things.  This patch was just an example of how they contradict themselves yet again.<p><p><br>
