Felwithe and Qeynos both have all the spells, and you don't have to run all over the temple like you do in Freeport to find the right vendor. :)<p>: I bought all my level 24 spells (except for the summon hammer spell) at kaladim - granted it's a long ride on the boat, but since i'm a dwarven cleric, I get a better price there and I usually don't find that I have a problem finding the spells.  Plus it feels good every now and then to return to my home town and see what's going on with the buildings & such.  The clerics guild in Freeport ususally has a pretty good selection of spells also.  The one in RiverVale has a majority of the spells, but sometimes lackes a few of the "not so important ones".  Haven't had time to check out the cleric guild in the elven city.
