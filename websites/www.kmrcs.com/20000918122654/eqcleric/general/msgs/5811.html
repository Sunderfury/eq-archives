I agree with all the things you brought up, but this seems to be written in anger.  Sure we are all up in arms, and most of the clerics I know aren't going to bother with the new armor.  But if you are going to complain, at least be civil.  It may actually make them read it instead of immediately deleting it.<p>BTW, crappy stats and yellow?  I really have no desire to look like a lemon anytime soon.<p>~ren
