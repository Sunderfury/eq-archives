The best way to get to the keep is to print off a map.  Basically you pass through the orc area and continue on till you get to the bridge.  After you get to the bridge you head down toward the snake tavern (not sure of the name) and kinda wander that way.  You hit the keep before you get to the gnolls.  It should have bold letters on top of it that says something like High Hold Keep.  If you go inside and zone, then you can go around and downstairs where the gobblins are.  Usually there are a few people in the area, just ask one of them to show you how to get to the gobblins.  Also there is a bank just before you go into the basement and up stairs there is a female merchant that sells a lot of different gem types.  You can get the items you need for the symbol spells here.<p><p>: Goblins in the keep?  I have never heard of this spot.<br>: Can you give me some more detail?

I had a fantastic weekend in the keep.  I was grouped with a group of higher levels than I (lot higher, majority were 6-8 levels above me) but I was welcomed due to my healing prowess.  I think I made about 30-35 plat this weekend and made 1 2/3 level.  I started Friday night with about 1/2 toward 25 and ended last night with about 1/4 of a bubble left to finish til i'm 26.  All in all it was a good weekend.
