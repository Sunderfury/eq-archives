: My question is very simple and straightforward, and im sure i speak for a good majority of the clerics out there. Where do you get ALL this info from. I dont even know what zone this temple is in. I thought all of this stuff was going to be implemented in the expansion, but now im seeing it in pictures, so sombody must have it. Are these pictures from Beta? Can we begin to accumulate items now for when these quest are implemented or are all these quest already available? If i can start them now, how do i get to this Temple? I'm sorry, i know i said 1 question, but all is related, and I think others out there might want to know.<p>: Badmer Gravelight<br>: Tarew Marr<p>Well the temple of solseck ro is near sola and solb.  In there two clerics will give you all the info you need.<br>
