Okay...I like where you are going with this.  Basically the same thing that Mills was advocating in his post.<p>IMO, All endure and resist spells should be moved up one rank.   They are not that used that often as is, anything to make them more accepted would be nice.<p>Group Naltron..lol..that would put you in the poor house fast =p  That regent is way out of line with the spell benefit and really needs to be addressed.  4 or 5 plat is plently to spend on a spell that also cost alot of mana and has a relatively short duration.<p>
