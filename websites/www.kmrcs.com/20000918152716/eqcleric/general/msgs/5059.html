Well it's definately clear that you no longer want to play your Cleric. Perhaps we should appreciate your advice....but like I said before, what you're experiencing happens with all classes.<br>Most of us here seem to be disagreeing with you over it being difficult to find a group. I've never gotten a Cleric high enough in levels to know whether this will happen to me or not.<br>But for sure a Cleric is not a good solo class, and if a person has trouble grouping then I'm sure playing a Cleric sucks for them.<br>Maybe it is the maturity of the server you are on. I have an idea ! I never have a problem cause I group with RW friends who I've been gaming with for years...we're on the same time table so we're always around at the right times.....buy your friends EQ accounts <br>for Christmas and then go play a Druid for a couple months till they level up their chars.....either way, in a couple months you either have a high level druid that you're happy with...or you have a permenant group to play with heh heh.<p>Really though, I always look at it this way...This is a game. Chances are you got enjoyment out of your char for awhile or you never woulda stuck with it. Now it's time for a change. So you start over with a new class....many of us have done this ....it's no big deal.<br>The months you invested in your Cleric was game playing....it's not like it's our futures that we build on this game.<br>You didn't enjoy this class ...you complained about both the lower and higher levels.....many of us do enjoy it and don't have trouble grouping. If anyone is playing a low level Cleric and hates being a healer they should switch Now as you are recommending.<br>Most classes get better with time, but if you hate a char in its youth you will likely enjoy it no better later on.<p>The bottom line here is that for "some" the Cleric class sucks....for others it is the best in the game.<br> It's obvious by the fact that both high and low level Clerics on this board don't share your views on the class that it's a personal thing more than a class thing.<br> But I agree with you on one thing ...if a person is having trouble playing a Cleric at low levels (for whatever reasons) it's not likely to get better for them. I see people often encouraging a person to stick with their Cleric even after the person just posted a message like<br>"I HATE my Cleric". If you make a char and don't enjoy playing it then make a different one as soon as you realise it. I never advise people to "stick with it"....if you're not happy then start over.<p>Lydia<br>: Actually I've been complemented all the time I've played my ways through the levels.  The only people that have complained are the tanks who don't know the word mana and refuse to listen to party mana.  <p>: : Let me ask you this...when you die do you immediately cuss out all the party members then hit disband?  I know alot of people like that in the game that can't find a group later.

Hell just the other day I saw a guy I played with about 2 months ago who really didn't play much.  The kicker is I'm a good 17 levels above him, and grouping isn't likely.  Finding a consistent group of people to group with in EQ is extremely hard.  One day someone may play, one day another might and people start to get level segregated.<p>: Being a high level cleric and trying to group up in a high level dungeon that has too many clerics in it just doesn't seem to wash.<p><br>
