          <p><b><font size="4">Spectre soloing in Feerrott:</font></b><br>
          <br>
          See the map included below for approximate loc's.<br>
          <br>
          Personally i started soloing the Spectres at lvl 39, with 178 wis -
          and found myself to run out of mana on the higher lvl Spectres - but i
          have also heard stories of people successfully doing it at lvl 34 - so
          feel free to try them before 39, but don't whack me on the head if you
          die :)<br>
          <br>
          <b>First some general info on spectres</b>:<br>
          <br>
          The Spectre cave has a hidden wall, so you will not be able to see it,
          however there is a easy way of locating it. Exactly by the zonewall,
          almost on it - there is a tree..on the left side of this tree is the
          fake wall to enter the cave.</p>
          <p>Spectres generally range from lvl 32 to 37 and have from ~1700 to a
          bit over 2000 hp depending on their level, the higher level ones (36
          to 37) also has SpectreStun, which will stun you for a few seconds,
          much to the joy of the spectres who will slice n dice you in that
          time. And they do it fast! This spell / effect will ONLY take effect
          if they are able to get into melee range, which we will definitely try
          to avoid as they hit for 92-96 points / swing!</p>
          <p><br>
          Their spellcasting is however nothing to worry about, the life tapping
          spell they cast only takes out ~20 hp, so ignore that.</p>
          <p>Having Journeymans Boots or SOW is almost a must, unless you want
          to keep fearing them and running after them to nuke (very annoying
          IMHO) - or you can team up with a druid or ranger and let them snare
          the spectre. Also, do not run too far out of their range, as they will
          teleport up on you if you do.<br>
          <br>
          Now, lets move on to the interesting part - SpectreSlaying 101.<br>
          <br>
          First, go to point A on the map, its a rocky corner..possibly some
          lizards or beetles crawling on the wall - ignore those, they will not
          aggro on you, however the strolling lizards will if they get close
          enough. Then put up Valor or Resolution, whichever you have - putting
          up Armor of Faith might also be a good idea since there are some times
          the spectres might catch up with you, and believe me - getting double
          hit for 96's is NOT a clerics idea of a good time. Those that are a
          little bit worried and are doing it for the first time, might also
          want to buff themselves with Symbol of Pinzarn. Then med up and get
          ready for the fun.<br>
          <br>
          The easiest one to solo, is the Tree Spectre - a solo spectre by a
          tree (duh).<br>
          <br>
          If you follow the Rathe zone wall up the slope, and take a right turn
          to point C on the map, you will see the spectre a little down the
          slope to your right by a tree (marked out on the map).&nbsp; Now,
          pulling him into the corner is a *bad* idea, since his friends in the
          cave will be most pleased to come assist him - and believe me, the
          spectres have a HUGE aggro range!<br>
          <br>
          Start off with a Expel (Or Banish, depending on level), run to point B
          on the map - then root him while he is still on top of the hill, blast
          a few more times, back up - root him again etc (rinse and repeat). Try
          to avoid running too close to the bone ruins, as they will attack you
          no matter which level you are and *might* be able to interrupt your
          spell at a bad time.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          I tend to run from point B, to point D and then to point E - if they
          are not dead by then, back to point B - then rinse and repeat, do NOT
          run so far that you can't see the spectre, as he will teleport up on
          you if you do.</p>
          <p>Spook the dead also works, but I prefer root...its *so* annoying
          when you start Expel and they go out of range cause of the fear spell.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Should it happen that the Tree Spectre is already taken by a fellow
          cleric, or one of those pesky wizards - its possible to pull a single
          spectre (*very* rarely two) from the cave without entering it by the
          means of decoy pulling.<br>
          <br>
          Go to the bone ruin (marked on the map) and have one skeleton attack
          you, do NOT kill it, and then move to the tree by the forest / stone
          border outside the Spectre Cave. Don't go too close to the zone wall,
          as you will attract more than one spectre then - the first few times
          you might not be able to do this successfully, but just keep trying -
          you'll get the feeling for it eventually.<br>
          <br>
          The huge aggro radius of the spectres will make them want to come to
          aid the poor skeleton that is bashing on you, and one will pop out of
          the cave to come help...so just back up to point B and then start your
          regular root 'n shoot routine.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Some prefer to drag the spectres along the Cazic zone wall, but if you
          are a good race you might run into Bouncer Flerb...so that might be a
          bad idea...to each his own i guess.<br>
          <br>
          Also, if / when you get too many and have to train them - do it to the
          Rathe Mountains zone as there are often a few people at the Cazic zone
          meditating and recovering from battles inside Cazic - and pulling 3
          spectres there will make you very unpopular and give you a bad name
          VERY fast, so avoid that.<br>
