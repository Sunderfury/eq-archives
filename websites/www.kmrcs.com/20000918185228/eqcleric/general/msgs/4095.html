Endure Magic and Holy Might are very important at this level also....endure magic because it raises your magic resistance, and holy might because it is a nice stun spell....also ward summoned isn't bad to have, never know when you'll be up against summoned critters, as far as yaulp and the AOE spell (word of something, can't remember), just depends whether you want to get or not, I've never really used any of the yaulp spells, never found them useful.  I have used the AOE maybe a handful of times, but that is one you could prolly skip till a later time, I find that AOE's get me in more trouble than anything ;)<p>Just my 2 cents<p>Ianina Faithhealer<br>High Cleric of Tunare<br>40th circle<br>Tarew Marr<p>: I keep looking at the cleric's level 19 spells and I keep thinking that they are more and more useless.
