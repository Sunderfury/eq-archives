I think that all the classes are important.  No class is a "necessity" until after level 20, really.  Many lower level melee classes (as seen in earlier posts) have no clue what the differences in class are or why those differences are put into the game (and important).  They see a robe and think "DD DAMAGE SPELLS", they see a blunt weapons and think "Heal" or "SoW", they see armor and bladed weapons and think "MELEE".  It's just like learning a new zone, you have to be there (or have one in your group) for a little while until those differences become apparent.  You can get to higher levels without ever knowing about the capabilities of a few of the other classes.<p>That being said, I agree that enchanters and clerics are 2 of the most party enchancing classes out there.  It's hard to rate them after these two, because certain zones/areas require a different make-up of classes.  I would never go to Mistmoore with a Druid and Cleric (I'd love to go with an enchanter but that hasn't happend yet).  All the big DD casting classes have their advantages and disadvantages.  I'd say throw a shaman in the group too for some additional buffs or a Bard to REALLY cut down the downtime.<p>Melee classes I like?  <br>1. Warriors- Taunt is my friend and with their HP, I can cast one Complete Heal and be VERY mana efficient<br>2a. Monks- Amazing damage at higher levels<br>2b. Bard- Play that funky music (manasong)<br>2c. Paladins- Stun and minor healing for mana transfers during downtime (addicted to my manastone)<br>5. Rogue- Backstabs can be a HUGE taunt<br>6. Rangers- Great solo, but in groups- snare/SoW is the only thing they add that's unique to melee classes (I played one to 30- but my experience with higher level rangers re-enforces my personal experience)<br>
