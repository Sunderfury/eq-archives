: Hmm... depends on what you consider un-broke.  I
: have just about all my level 14 spells (all the
: ones I care about), decent equipment, and over
: 25pp in the bank, at level 15.  I don't consider
: myself to be broke at all.

: : 3)what items should I start looking for?

: Largely depends on what you have and what you
: want.
