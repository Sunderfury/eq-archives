If the tank is unable to get the mob off the cleric, who's to say that the 2nd tank would have any better luck?  Having a 2nd cleric in the party mean that if a cleric pulled a mob onto themselves for DD (undead or not), then the other cleric can keep them healed up until the tank is able to pull the mob off of them.
