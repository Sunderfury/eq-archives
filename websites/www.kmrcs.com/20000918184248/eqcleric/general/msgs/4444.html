: I was weighing all the advantages and disadvantages when creating my character... Dwarves seemed to be the best suited for clerics.

: BUT... 

: I having reached hell level 2 (lvl 35) i began to think about the experience point advantage that humans get. You know.. if there was a superhigh level item that gave a 10% xp bonus... imagine

: RING OF THE SAGE
: AC 2
: EFFECT: 10% xp bonus
: RACES: ALL
: CLASSES: ALL

: How much would this ring be worth? how much??? It would have to be a Nagafen prize and would be UNATTAINABLE by any trades or money cuz of its value. The human xp advantage is the most underrated plus in the game. When you get to hell levels and above you will learn to agree. 

: Now... If verant ever gave one of those as a prize, THEN id be pissed if i was a human. (unless i got the prize that is.. hehe)
