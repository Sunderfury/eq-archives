: clerics do have the best equip.. they shouldnt get plate and who cares if u have crappy weps no cleric uses melee above 30th lvl if u do then u are dum most high lvl clerics dont even carry a wep so shut up and heal u dont even ned armor cuz we taunt every monster of u.<br>: KORRAL<p>Every monster? Whoo, boy, there's a hoot!  Taunt means exactly nothing to me.  When I die, it's not the critter you are on that kills me, it's his 3 buddies that jump me because I healed some tank who brought more than they should have back to fight.  I realize that noone can control that all of the time, but when it happens, I die.  I don't get out unless I'm right at a zone.  The armor means you do have some time to get the critter(s) off of me so I can heal. And if you don't bother, then to quote Conan, "To hell with you."<p>Tatianna Val'Sharess (RZ)<p>
