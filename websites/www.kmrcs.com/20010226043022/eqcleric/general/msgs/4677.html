This would not just be for clerics, but perhaps shaman as well. (I dont' think druids need this at all.. Their skin buff is about equal to courage line, but much burn much more mana, cast slower, and are not efficient for group buffing. Should stay that way =) )<p>We should receive a group version of buffs, one rank after we get them. This wouldnt' go for all buffs, like maybe not the resist magic/fire/etc buffs, but for the courage line, holy armor, symbol, skin for druids, +stat buffs for shamans, etc.  There should be a reduction in mana spent, and regents used when these are cast in a full group, and of course they would make it a lot faster to buff a whole group up, save mana, reagents, time, and mouse clicking.<p><br>So, here's what I suggest for cleric buffs:<p>Courage Line<p>Level 1 : Courage<br>Level 5 : Group Courage- 50 mana<br>Level 9 : Center<br>Level 14: Group Center - 200 mana<br>Level 19: Daring<br>Level 24: Bravery, Group Daring - 300 mana<br>Level 29: Group Bravery - 350 mana<br>Level 34: Valor<br>Level 39: Group Valor - 450 mana<br>Level 44: Resolution<br>Level 49: Group Resolution - 550 mana<p>Holy Armor Line<p>Level 5 : Holy Armor<br>Level 9 : Group Holy Armor - 100 mana<br>Level 19: Spirit Armor<br>Level 24: Group Spirit Armor - 375 mana<br>Level 29: Guard<br>Level 34: Group Guard - 400 mana<br>Level 39: Armor of Faith<br>Level 44: Group armor of faith - 750 mana<br>Level 49: Shield of Words<p>Symbol line<p>Level 14: Transal<br>Level 19: Group Transal - 275 mana, 5 stones<br>Level 24: Rhyltan<br>Level 29: Group Rhyltan - 555 mana, 5 stones<br>Level 34: Pinzarn<br>Level 39: Group Pinzarn - 1000 mana, 5 stones<br>Level 44: Naltron<br>Level 49: Group Naltron - 1575 mana, 5 stones          <p>Endure Line<p>For these, we should receive a group version 2 spell ranks after we receive the normal one.  <p>Level 19: Group endure poison - 100 mana<br>          Group endure fire - 100 mana<p>Level 24: Group endure cold - 100 mana<br>          Group endure disease - 100 mana<p>Level 29: Group endure magic - 200 mana<p>Level 44: Group resist fire - 250 mana<br>          Group resist poison - 250 mana<p>Level 49: Group resist cold - 250 mana<br>        : Group resist disease - 250 mana<p>Group resist magic is an enchanter spell, no one else gets it =0<p><p>Other group spells:<p>Level 14: Group Invigor - 100 mana<br>Level 24: Group extinguish fatigue - 175 mana<p><p>The courage line is generally kept up on EVERYONE.. caster, tanks, all party members get it.  It is a quick, low mana cost HP and AC buff.  It makes sense to me to put in group versions of this spell that always has to be cast on 6 people, one after another.  These group versions would be VERY well used..<p>The armor line, well, these are not efficient buffs to begin with.  Generally, self buffs, and on tanks.  If there isn't much risk to the party, holy armor buffs are often never used.  You spend so much more mana for what you get than you do on the courage line.  The only use for this, in an all tank party, or before VERY hard fights where you need every buff you can get. (Taking on cazic thule in the plane of fear for example =)  )<p>The group symbols would be more used in later levels.  Before then, only before a difficult battle.  At high levels, these would be great though, the reagent cost for all but Naltron isn't considered much.  At level 50, group pinzarn would be a very well used spell.  Naltron is very costly in both reagents and mana (315 mana, 12pp reagent).. Pinzarn is used much more often.  Another thing, Paladins get Pinzarn..  Effectively giving them the best overall symbol since naltron is so costly to use.  Clerics need a group version of it =)<p>Group fatigue spells for kedge keep, and other underwater adventures =)<p><p>Shamans should probably get some of the same.  Their stat buffs need group versions, same endure/resist group spells.  No need for other group spells by them though in my opninion.  Druids I don't know.. they dont' need anything else =)  Wouldn't bother me much if they got the group endure/resist spells however =)  <p><br>Suggestions & comments welcome =)<br>

: This would not just be for clerics, but perhaps shaman as well. (I dont' think druids need this at all.. Their skin buff is about equal to courage line, but much burn much more mana, cast slower, and are not efficient for group buffing. Should stay that way =) )

: We should receive a group version of buffs, one rank after we get them. This wouldnt' go for all buffs, like maybe not the resist magic/fire/etc buffs, but for the courage line, holy armor, symbol, skin for druids, +stat buffs for shamans, etc.  There should be a reduction in mana spent, and regents used when these are cast in a full group, and of course they would make it a lot faster to buff a whole group up, save mana, reagents, time, and mouse clicking.

: 
: So, here's what I suggest for cleric buffs:

: Courage Line

: Level 1 : Courage
: Level 5 : Group Courage- 50 mana
: Level 9 : Center
: Level 14: Group Center - 200 mana
: Level 19: Daring
: Level 24: Bravery, Group Daring - 300 mana
: Level 29: Group Bravery - 350 mana
: Level 34: Valor
: Level 39: Group Valor - 450 mana
: Level 44: Resolution
: Level 49: Group Resolution - 550 mana

: Holy Armor Line

: Level 5 : Holy Armor
: Level 9 : Group Holy Armor - 100 mana
: Level 19: Spirit Armor
: Level 24: Group Spirit Armor - 375 mana
: Level 29: Guard
: Level 34: Group Guard - 400 mana
: Level 39: Armor of Faith
: Level 44: Group armor of faith - 750 mana
: Level 49: Shield of Words

: Symbol line

: Level 14: Transal
: Level 19: Group Transal - 275 mana, 5 stones
: Level 24: Rhyltan
: Level 29: Group Rhyltan - 555 mana, 5 stones
: Level 34: Pinzarn
: Level 39: Group Pinzarn - 1000 mana, 5 stones
: Level 44: Naltron
: Level 49: Group Naltron - 1575 mana, 5 stones          

: Endure Line

: For these, we should receive a group version 2 spell ranks after we receive the normal one.  

: Level 19: Group endure poison - 100 mana
:           Group endure fire - 100 mana

: Level 24: Group endure cold - 100 mana
:           Group endure disease - 100 mana

: Level 29: Group endure magic - 200 mana

: Level 44: Group resist fire - 250 mana
:           Group resist poison - 250 mana

: Level 49: Group resist cold - 250 mana
:         : Group resist disease - 250 mana

: Group resist magic is an enchanter spell, no one else gets it =0


: Other group spells:

: Level 14: Group Invigor - 100 mana
: Level 24: Group extinguish fatigue - 175 mana


: The courage line is generally kept up on EVERYONE.. caster, tanks, all party members get it.  It is a quick, low mana cost HP and AC buff.  It makes sense to me to put in group versions of this spell that always has to be cast on 6 people, one after another.  These group versions would be VERY well used..

: The armor line, well, these are not efficient buffs to begin with.  Generally, self buffs, and on tanks.  If there isn't much risk to the party, holy armor buffs are often never used.

(Taking on cazic thule in the plane of fear for example =)  )

: The group symbols would be more used in later levels.  Before then, only before a difficult battle.  At high levels, these would be great though, the reagent cost for all but Naltron isn't considered much.  At level 50, group pinzarn would be a very well used spell.  Naltron is very costly in both reagents and mana (315 mana, 12pp reagent).. Pinzarn is used much more often.  Another thing, Paladins get Pinzarn..  Effectively giving them the best overall symbol since naltron is so costly to use.  Clerics need a group version of it =)

: Group fatigue spells for kedge keep, and other underwater adventures =)


: Shamans should probably get some of the same.  Their stat buffs need group versions, same endure/resist group spells.  No need for other group spells by them though in my opninion.  Druids I don't know.. they dont' need anything else =)  Wouldn't bother me much if they got the group endure/resist spells however =)
