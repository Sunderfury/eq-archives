It is a zone bug.  If you go unconscious while you are zoning, you revert back to your last save point.  It has happened to me a few times, and I never leave my chair while zoning and running from a MOB until I'm safely on the other side (did that once, never again!)<p>Nizdaar<p>: My party was facing 2 Ghouls, a Necro, and more skeletons than Bill Clinton has in his closet -Damn wisp-NEVER med near them (they jump you, run like hell and create more trains than the idiots in Unrest)! So I made the “RUN” call in Bottom floor of Befallen. WHACK, WHACK WHACK…I get to the stairs and things are looking grim. I less than half bubble left…<br>: I cast DA for the final sprint to the zone. I continue to crawl my way to the entrance at which point, DA wears off. WHACK, WHACK….LOADING.<br>: I made it with a sliver to spare. Here’s where it gets strange: I was looking forward to a nice long MED session in West Commons side, when I zone back to the spot that I cast DA. Same health, same Mobs and DA is still on. DEJA-WEIRD.<br>: So I haul ass…um hobble out-again. Zone. Again with a sliver. By this time, my party was out, all alive and I zoned safely back to WC with 11 hp’s.<p>: /em chikung cheers<p>
