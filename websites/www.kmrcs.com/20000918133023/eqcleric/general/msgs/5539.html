: Though i dont agree with you about changing classes, I will say that I agree about the quests.

: After talking to my shaman, ranger, and enchanter friend, it has become apparent that for some reason the Cleric quests are much more difficult than the quests for other

: My main problem with this is as follows:

: I am a 35 cleric, and as one, I could have spent time camping for the rubicite gloves, boots, and bplate.

: Instead, I chose to wait for these quests to come out. As it turns out, I am no longer &quot;High&quot; enough to try to attempt to get these proposed &quot;replacements&quot; for rubicite. 
: There is no sense making these quests so unattainable, when at lvl 46, clerics will end up going to fear for POF armor which is so far superior to this, and equally as

: Why do you think we of all classes got the shaft? I dont get it.
