I posted the same question on Japanese BBS and got the following answer.<p>There are two kinds of potion you get in exchange of Honey Jum. One is "Potion Disease Ward" and the other is "Ochre Potion Disease Ward" (you can find this out by wizard's Identify Item spell). If you give Lempeck an "Ochre Potion Disease Ward", you'll get attacked.<p>The potion is No Drop, so it's impossible for me to know if it's the right one or not (though I also heard that there is a weight difference between those two), so it's pure luck for me.

: I posted the same question on Japanese BBS and got the following answer.

: There are two kinds of potion you get in exchange of Honey Jum. One is &quot;Potion Disease Ward&quot; and the other is &quot;Ochre Potion Disease Ward&quot; (you can find this out by wizard's Identify Item spell). If you give Lempeck an &quot;Ochre Potion Disease Ward&quot;, you'll get attacked.

: The potion is No Drop, so it's impossible for me to know if it's the right one or not (though I also heard that there is a weight difference between those two), so it's pure luck for me.
