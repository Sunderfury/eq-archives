allows a spell effect in this case to be added as either a positive or negative

show up as a bug until those shields are stacked. It'll go in in the next patch, 
where they will stack correctly.

              <li>On this whole thing about the <i>Battle Cleric</i> I have a
                few comments:&nbsp;
                <ul>
                  <li>In my opinion the term <i>Battle Cleric</i> refers to <b>tactics</b>,
                    not armor.&nbsp; Battle Cleric, in my mind connotes an
                    offensively oriented cleric, not one wearing plate
                    armor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                  <li>All clerics, for obvious reasons, feel that a high AC is
                    important.&nbsp; Some, however, feel that mana is more
                    valuable to the group and therefore sacrifice AC for
                    Wisdom.&nbsp; This difference is especially noticeable among
                    higher level clerics due to the ever-lessening viability of
                    a cleric successfully tanking (i.e. soaking up
                    damage).&nbsp; The high level mobs (45+) generally just hit
                    too hard.</li>
                  <li>Try to understand the other player's perspective in these
                    arguments.&nbsp; The perspective of a level 25-35 cleric
                    will be very different than that of a 45+ cleric.&nbsp; Both
                    people may be right when relating to their own
                    experiences.&nbsp; It's just that the game changes for
                    clerics so much as we increase in levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>

              <p>Cleric Armor<br>
              A couple of us have been talking about class-specific armor over
              the past couple of weeks and will bring it up in a tuning meeting
              soon.
              <p>As far as cleric armor is concerned, I'm ok with the stats, but
              less so with the AC. The idea of making a cleric choose between
              being a Wisdom Cleric and a Battle Cleric seems to be a good
              trade-off, but the AC advantage should be pretty good if they
              choose Battle Cleric.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I sure hope the AC is raised, but can't help but feel that we
            should not be forced to decide between high Wisdom and AC.&nbsp; If
            I want high Wisdom on my character why am I forced to dress like a
            druid?&nbsp; High AC was supposed to be my advantage over druids and
            shamans who have that nifty SoW spell (what is SoW worth in terms of
            AC, 100, 200 points?).&nbsp; I personally don't believe we should
            have to make that trade-off, or at least it shouldn't be as drastic
            as it is.</p>
            <p>As far as Gordon being ok with the stats I'd feel a lot better if
            he engaged in some dialogs with high-level clerics.&nbsp; I suspect
            he might learn a thing or two.</p>
            <p>When I got my Caduceus at level 34 I tried to tank.&nbsp; I tried
            for several levels to do melee damage.&nbsp; My Caduceus is back in
            the bank.</p>

            <p>No, I'm not talking about the Cleric Temple Quests, instead I'm
            referring to the frequent crashes and severe overcrowding that has
            occurred after Christmas.&nbsp; For the last few weeks zoning for me
            and many others has become an adventure; I have yet to keep a log
            but I crashed at least 5 times while zoning last night.&nbsp; I
            don't know if this is a networking issue or server capacity issue,
            but the game is really starting to feel unstable.&nbsp; And these
            issues are definitely Verant's; I use real-time voice connections to
            my other group members and that doesn't go down, just the game.</p>
            <p>Also, while Fennin Ro is generally the most crowded server,
            Karana is definitely in the running for a money position.&nbsp; We
            are frequently hitting 2400 and yesterday peaked at around
            2700.&nbsp; I have no idea where all the new people are hunting, but
            it's getting extremely difficult to find hunting places.&nbsp;
            Remember when I was excited about Kedge, Kithicor, and Paw?&nbsp;
            Yes, Paw is open, but after having spent Saturday night there
            completely sweeping the top 1/2 of the zone (sweep as in nothing
            alive) the loot (or experience at 45) just isn't there.&nbsp; I
            expect we're going to return and sweep the bottom and experience the
            same disappointment.&nbsp; Oh, and the pathing is pretty bad too,
            making the zone more dangerous than it should be.&nbsp; Kithicor is
            now dead in the day time, but even before was not really a good
            place to hunt for experience (too many roamers).&nbsp; Kedge I admit
            I haven't spent enough time in.&nbsp; We need new zones and we need
            them soon.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Dear Verant, </p>
            <p>I'm happy that you made some of these positive changes.&nbsp; A
            lot of classes got some badly needed upgrades.&nbsp; However, I
            think possibly you forgot a few things: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Our quest armor is terribly difficult to get also.&nbsp; While
                admittedly you mentioned that you will look at the other classes
                in the future, would it have really been that hard to address
                our ultra-rare spawns?&nbsp; Some of these spawns are <b>rare</b>.&nbsp;
                There are reports of people hitting the Babbinshort spawn for 40
                spawns straight (with a 7 hour recycle time) before getting the
                item.&nbsp; The ranger/warrior stuff falls out of the sky.</li>
              <li>How hard is it exactly to fix our quests so that in the
                unlikely event a cleric actually completes one experience is
                granted?&nbsp; This is a <b>bug</b>.&nbsp; Use the same criteria
                as the other classes for the actual amounts.&nbsp; Completing
                the Raincaller quest grants 3/4 of a bubble at level 46 by way
                of comparison.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Oh, and gee, thanks for the manastone nerf.&nbsp; No, really,
            change your mind about adding them back in as a quest, that's
            ok.&nbsp; Don't take them away, just nerf the bejeesus out of
            them.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;Thanks guys.</p>
            <p>Damn, most of this <a href="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/Forum1/HTML/001200.html" style="color: #0000FF">patch</a>
            was excellent too.</p>

            <p>Over the course of this month I will be moving this site.&nbsp;
            It's popularity has grown to the point where it is no longer
            feasible for me to pay for it's maintenance out of my pocket (i.e.
            bandwidth over-utilization charges).&nbsp; It will have a new
            address, <a href="http://" style="color: #0000FF">http://eqcleric.gameglow.com</a>
            and will become part of the Gameglow network.&nbsp; </p>
            <p>It will also have banner ads.&nbsp; The Gameglow people are
            hoping to one day make money from these sites and banner ads is part
            of the price sites such as mine must pay to get free hosting.&nbsp;
            Oh, don't get me wrong, if the $$$ start rolling in I'll get a piece
            of the action also, but at this point I'm not quitting my day
            job.&nbsp; While I'm not totally enamored of advertising either,
            it's quite common and I've learned to just tune it out.&nbsp; I'm
            certainly not advocating you ignore any advertising displayed on
            this site (far from it), but I've seen enough messages about this
            issue over the course of EQ Cleric's existence to know how some of
            you feel.</p>
            <p>Do not send me e-mail offering donations (unless you are talking
            three figures or greater).&nbsp; I'm really not interested in
            collecting $5 a month from various people.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong,
            I think it's wonderful that people make those posts and send me
            those e-mails, it shows that they really appreciate this site.&nbsp;
            However, I'm going to go with the normal advertising model and hope
            that covers the costs for this site's continued existence.</p>
            <p>I will try to ensure that all the old messages from the forums
            are carried over, but at this point will not guarantee it (only
            because I have yet to do all the research).&nbsp; That is my number
            one goal for the move of this site, so rest assured I will work on
            it extremely hard.</p>
            <p>As always, I would like to thank all of you who come here and
            help make this place the wonderful community for clerics that it has
            becom.</p>
