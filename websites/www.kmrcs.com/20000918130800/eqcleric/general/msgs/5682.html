<br>On Vallon Zek the necros are whining about their stuff NOT being NO DROP. I love NO DROP since it cannot be looted after a PvP death. Besides, everyone would harvest the quest items and sell the cleric parts if they weren't no drop. Less competition now.<p>// Mirixia<p>: Verant:<p>: WHY OH WHY are you screwing us yet again??  It is not only EXTREMELY tedious to acquire our armor, it is expensive and now it is mandatory for you to complete the quest if you want it!!! No buying it from someone else.  WHY is ours the ONLY one that is no drop???<p>: EXTREMELY pissed,<p>: Astur il'Ayan<p>
