: : : If you are in the qeynos area, there is a relatively easy quest to recieve free cleric spells.  I got the 24th Level Fear spell and another 24th level spell (forgot).  It starts with the blessed oil quest.  Brother Estle will give you some prayer beads, take these beads to the Priestess Jandra (I think) and she give you a note to take to Brother ? who is held captive in split paw.  Give him the letter and he gives you a key.  Take the key back to one of the vendors in the qeynos temple of life (Its a specific Vendor and he is not always there) and he will give you a spell.  I have heard that he will give you a spell up to level 29.  I got 2 24th level spells.  <p>
