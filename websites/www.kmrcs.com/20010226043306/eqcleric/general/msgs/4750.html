Not only do I play a cleric but I play a Druid as well.  The DOTs have been nerfed, but i can live with that just fine.  Snare on the other hand is strange.  The Ensnare spell which is supposed to be an upgrade has a shorter duration, is resisted more often.  That just seems odd.  Now as for the whining complaining jerks you speak of, I myself am not one of those, nor have I met any.  Druids are a fun class, but my cleric of the same level is considerably tougher and does much more damage.  Al least clerics can wear real armor.  You should not generalize people by what class they play either, I play 4 different classes myself, and most people have at least one other charachter.<p><br>: I have never meet one druid in the whole time of playing what was not some whining, complaining jerk.<p>: This is another example..<p>
