          <hr>
          <p>When I wrote my original guide for this zone, I was around level 22
          and had been in Unrest (exclusively) since level 15. Obviously there
          were some things in the zone that I had not experienced at that point.
          Though I knew about most of the higher level MOBs and areas, I had not
          had much first hand experience with them. After another 10 levels or
          so in Unrest, I think I can fill in most of the gaps. I will give it a
          good shot at the very least. I know I will miss a few things and make
          a couple errors, so apologies in advance.</p>
          <p>There are descriptions of Unrest on EQ'lizer and other sites that
          paint a decent picture of what you will find in the zone and the level
          ranges of the MOBs. These sites are mostly accurate, but do contain
          some information that can get you into trouble. Obviously, others may
          have had different experiences in Unrest and may not agree with
          everything that I include here.</p>
          <p><big><strong>The Estate of Unrest</strong></big>:</p>
          <p><strong>Getting there</strong>: Unrest can be found off of Dagnar's
          Cauldron, which is in turn off of the Butcher Block Mountains. To
          reach Unrest after zoning into the Cauldron: Follow the long, winding
          gorge path that brings you to the heart of the Cauldron. Once the high
          walls fall away, continue a short distance up the slope in front of
          you until you see the water-line directly ahead and the NPC camp to
          your right. These NPCs are &quot;Good&quot; and will help you if you
          are of a good race and have decent faction. It is worth noting that
          these NPCs are not extremely high in level and they take a while to
          kill creatures such as Aqua Goblin Tidal Lords - luckily there are
          several NPCs here to help. Evil races and classes should most likely
          avoid this camp - although one of the NPCs is a Gnome.</p>
          <p>Once you have reached this point (water in front, NPC camp on the
          right), I have found that the best path to take is to continue on to
          the water's edge, turn right and start running (keeping the water on
          your left). The entrance to Unrest is about a 2 minute non-SOWed run.
          The entrance will be the typical cave in the side of the mountain that
          you see often in EQ. During this run you will most likely see several
          Aqua Goblins and you will pass their main camp. Just stay between
          Goblin camp and the water-line and they should not bother you. The
          real dangers are the wandering Aqua Goblins that criss-cross the
          Cauldron (lake). These jump in and out of the water and roam the
          shores. Avoid them when you can. When you can not, if you are too low
          of level to fight, you will have to train them to the Unrest entrance
          and zone in (or to the Butcher zone if you are leaving). Please
          remember to call out that you are training to the zone point -
          especially if you are training Tidal Lords to the Unrest entrance as
          their will be many players recuperating just outside.</p>
          <p>The Goblins are the biggest danger in the Cauldron and they range
          from the high-teens to the mid-twenties in level. You will also find
          Undertow Skeletons (high-teens), Rats (12-14ish I think), Giant Snakes
          (non-aggro, in the lower teens) and an Orc Camp (never tangled with
          them but I assume they are in the mid-teens). There is also a named
          Undertow Skeleton in the zone that sometimes drops a set of mediocre
          shoulderpads that have decent AC and add to your save vs cold.</p>
          <p><strong>Physical layout</strong>: Unrest is a small zone. Much
          smaller than many of the 'dungeon&quot; zones. The basic layout is: A
          long hallway that leads from the entrance to the courtyard. The
          courtyard is a medium-sized square area with a pair of fountains. A
          path runs between the fountains. If you continue on the path past the
          fountains, you will come to the mansion. The courtyard and the mansion
          are separated by a small hedge-maze. This is not really a maze and
          just lends an aesthetic touch to the zone.</p>
          <p>The mansion sits in the middle of the larger square area on this
          side of the maze. This is the meat of the zone. There are three doors
          leading to the first floor of the house - one in the front, one on the
          left side and one in the back. Players will use all of these doors to
          pull MOBs out to their groups who typically wait along the walls on
          the edge of the zone.</p>
          <p>The house has 3 floors and a basement. There are a few stairways
          within the house that will take you to the various levels. Not all
          rooms on each level connect and can sometimes only be reached by a
          particular stairway. The basement is found behind a secret doorway on
          the first floor. If you were to enter the house by the front door and
          take the left-most hallway towards the rear of the house, you would
          find this bookcase behind the second door on your left (in this
          left-hand hall). One click and you have found the passageway to hell.</p>
          <p><big><strong>MOBs &amp; Areas</strong></big>:<br>
          The outside of the house (lawn) and the floors help separate the
          different levels of creatures. There are several &quot;special&quot;
          MOBs in this zone which I will describe separately after this section.</p>
          <p><strong>On the lawn</strong> and in the courtyard you will find
          what the higher levels refer to as &quot;yard trash.&quot; These are
          the Death Beetles, Greater Skeletons, Tormented Dead (TD), Jack o'
          Lanterns and sometimes a low level Ghoul. These range from the
          mid-teens to the high-teens and can be very dangerous as they are
          aggro to players in this level range and they like to swarm -
          especially the beetles. --The loot for this area consists of the
          standard loot for most low-level areas of EQ - small amounts of coin,
          some cloth or cheap armor, rusty weapons with the occasional bronze
          weapon.</p>
          <p><strong>The first floor</strong> of the house contains Ghouls, Dark
          Boned Skeletons, Lurking Mummies and, sometimes, a Dry Boned Skeleton.
          These creatures are in the upper teens and can be quite tough for
          groups around the same level (Dry Bones are in the 20's). On the first
          floor, like elsewhere in the house, the MOBs spawn close together and
          there may be those that you do not see hiding behind doors or walls.
          Everything in the house is aggro to those who are not very high of
          level. Also, many of the MOBs from this point on start requiring
          magical weapons to be hit. --The loot for this area consists of runes,
          words, pages, rawhide and ring armor, and bronze weapons.</p>
          <p><strong>On the second floor</strong> of the house will you find Dry
          Boned Skeletons, Skeletal Monks, Carrion Ghouls, Werebats and Barbed
          Bone Skeletons. These baddies range from the low 20's to the high 20's
          and have some interesting characteristics. The Drys cast fire-based
          spells. The monks hit hard and fast - you will see them using some of
          the monk's special attacks. The Carrions will root you often and beat
          the heck out of you. Bats are quick little beasts who hit for fast
          damage. The Barbeds will possibly be your first glimpse into the
          &quot;Goodness, how many hit points does this thing have?!?&quot;
          arena, and some of them are casters as well. All of the Barbeds hit
          VERY hard. You will also find the Reclusive Ghoul Magi on the 2nd
          Floor. He will be noted a bit later. --The loot in this area is most
          player's initiation to &quot;the Good Life.&quot; Here you will find
          small bronze armor (mostly on the Drys) and fine steel weapons.</p>
          <p><strong>The third floor</strong> of the mansion is not all that
          different from the second when it comes to the normal spawns. Here you
          will find the Drys, Monks, Barbeds and CG's. However, the third floor
          is a bit different than the others as it is not as much of a true
          floor as it is a series of rooms that have different access stairways.
          I will go into some of these rooms in the next section as most of them
          hold the &quot;special&quot; MOBs, but the new arse-kickers that you
          will find in these rooms are Hags, Greater Dark Bones, an Undead
          Knight, a Reanimated Hand, Zombie Nobles and an Undead Barkeep. All of
          these new baddies are levels 24-30 and can really dish out the damage.
          The Greater Dark Bones (GDBs), Hags and the Nobles are not truly
          &quot;special&quot; MOBs as they do not drop specific items, but they
          are some of the toughest in the zone and worthy of a description in
          that section. --The loot is the same as the second floor with the
          exception of the special MOBs.</p>
          <p><strong>The Basement</strong>: Last, but certainly not least, we
          shall look at the basement. This was that pit of hell I referred to
          earlier. Here you will find many of the same MOBs that we have seen on
          the second and third floor, but you will see a lot more of them and
          they tend to be higher level than elsewhere. Again, the basement is
          behind the bookcase on the first floor. The basement has a main area
          and another secret area behind a false wall. In the main area of the
          basement you will find Hags (and lots of them!), Werebats, Monks,
          Barbeds and some very tough GDBs. Behind the secret wall - which is up
          the first set of stairs in the main area if you just keep heading in
          from the entrance - you may find more Hags and GDBs, a Mortuary
          Fungus, Tentacle Terrors and of course, Garanel Rucksforth, the lvl
          37ish Dwarven Spirit. All of these will be described in the next
          section. **NOTE: if you go through the false wall and down the hall to
          the point where you see a pool of lava directly in front of you and
          what appear to be walkways on either side - walk THROUGH the lava. It
          will not hurt you. The walkways are traps and you will fall into a
          pit, taking damage and possibly coming face-to-face with a tough
          basement denizen.</p>
          <p><strong>There is also an underwater cave</strong> in the stream by
          the Gazebo to the right of the house&nbsp; that contains a strange
          little Gnomish Spelunker and a high level MOB spawn (typically a Monk
          or Hag). The Gnome will attack you if you pull the MOB. The Gnome is
          about level 24 and people seem to have fun killing him. You will often
          hear shouts of &quot;Kill the Gnome!&quot; in the zone.</p>
          <p><big><strong>Special Mobs</strong></big>:<br>
          <strong>Greater Dark Bones</strong> are this zone's ultimate undead
          tank. These level 28-30 baddies hit for 50+ damage and potentially
          have 1000's of hit points. They are found in the third floor Knight
          Balcony and in the basement. --They have poor loot unless they are
          carrying piece of bronze armor or a FS weapon.</p>
          <p><strong>Festering Hags</strong> are perhaps the most feared
          creature in the zone - though they are not necessarily the toughest.
          Hags are casters pure and simple. If you don't let a Hag cast, you may
          live. They have a good amount of hit points but are not great at
          fisticuffs. Have the entire party melee Hags so they can not cast. If
          they do hit you with one of their spells, be ready to take 200+ damage
          if you are under level 25. Rush them, hit them, nuke them - do not let
          one stand and cast from afar or you will lose several group members
          before she decides to come in close and melee. Hags are found in the
          Basement and on the Knight Balcony.&nbsp; --Hags carry decent amounts
          of coin, gossimer armor, fine steel weapons and other random items.</p>
          <p><strong>Zombie Nobles</strong> are similar to a GDB. They hit hard
          and have a lot of hit points. They are found in the Barroom with the
          Undead Barkeep. --They have poor loot unless they are carrying piece
          of bronze armor or a FS weapon.</p>
          <p><strong>The Mortuary Fungus</strong> spawns behind the secret wall
          in the basement. He is a 26-28ish MOB that hits (fairly) hard and has
          a decent amount of hit points. His main weapon is a very powerful
          Drowsy spell that makes tanks swing like they are in molasses. Nuke
          him as much as you can because the tanks will not be able to do much
          damage. --I have never seen him carry more than a small amount of gold
          and possibly a cheap piece of jewelry.</p>
          <p><strong>Tentacle Terrors</strong> are level 28ish MOBs that are
          also found behind the secret wall in the basement. They are usually
          guarding the Dwarven Spirit. These silly looking cone-heads hit hard,
          drain you with the occasional life-tap, and will throw you across the
          room using their tentacles. You typically do not take a lot of damage
          from being thrown, however this makes battle hard for one of two
          reasons: if your tanks keep getting thrown, they have to run back over
          and start hitting again; or sometimes the Terror will stay on the
          player that it has thrown and chase him across the room or lawn and
          the entire party will have to scramble to get back into melee. --So
          far I have not looted anything decent from a TT. They have yielded
          pretty much the same type of loot as the Fungus. Assumedly they carry
          the rare Tentacle Whip.</p>
          <p><strong>The Reclusive Ghoul Magi</strong> is, as his name implies,
          a Ghoul Caster. He conjures a Necro skel pet and casts Boiling Blood,
          a painful DOT spell. he is around level 28. He spawns in one of the
          far back rooms on the second floor, near the back staircase that leads
          to the Barroom and Knight Balcony. --The Magi drops two good items -
          the Savant's Cap (+3 to WIS and INT) or the Blood Stained Gloves (+25
          mana for Pure Casters).</p>
          <p><strong>The Reanimated Hand</strong> spawns in a third floor area
          that is off of the &quot;Stuck Room&quot; where you will find CGs and
          Skels frozen in place - bugged. The Stuck Room is accessed via a
          flight of stairs found in the middle of the second floor. The Hand
          spawn is through the only door in this room. The Hand casts a powerful
          force spell, but, like the Hags, he can be interrupted easily. If the
          Hand can not cast, he is very easy to kill. He is typically around 26
          in level. --The Hand drops one of the most coveted items in the zone -
          the Ivory Bracelet (+3 AGIL and +20 mana).</p>
          <p><strong>The Undead Barkeep</strong> is found in the Barroom of
          course. This room is in the back of the house off of the stairway that
          continues up to the Knight Balcony. The Keeper spawns behind the
          little structure that is shaped like a, you guessed it, bar. The
          Keeper is another level 26-28ish MOB. --The Barkeep drops the Thick
          Leather Apron (8 AC, 1 weight) or the Opalline Earring (2 AC, +5
          CHAR).</p>
          <p><strong>The Undead Knight of Unrest</strong> spawns on the third
          floor balcony that is often referred to as the Knight Balcony. This is
          at the very top of the staircase in the back of the house. The Knight
          is a 26-28ish undead Shadow Knight who will life-tap. He also casts
          other aggressive spells and has a pet. He is one of the most
          sought-after MOBs in the zone for the loot he carries. --The Knight
          drops Bloodstained Tunics (12 AC +4 WIS +4 AGIL) and Bloodstained
          Mantles (+3 STR and +10 vs magic).</p>
          <p><strong>Garanel Rucksforth</strong> spawns in the very back of the
          basement after the secret wall and false lava pool. He is usually
          accompanied by 2 Hags and 2 Tentacle Terrors. If you are going to take
          him on, make sure to get rid of his outer-most guards first. It is
          doubtful you will be able to take care of the two closest to him
          without Garanel coming as well. He is around level 35-37 and hits very
          hard and fast. I have been hit by him for four times in one round for
          80+ damage each. Do not take him on without a full group of 30ish or
          higher levels. --Garanel drops the Dwarven Work Boots (8 AC, +3 STR,
          +5 DEX) or Jagged Bands (5 AC, +3 STR)</p>
          <p><big><strong>Pulling:</strong></big><br>
          This section will suggest reasonable pulling techniques for some
          general level ranges. Please note that this is very subjective and
          having a group member or two that is higher level than the suggested
          range will change things considerably.</p>
          <p><strong>Levels 15-18</strong><br>
          If you're here before level 15, you are brave! (Admittedly many come
          here as early as 12-14 now): At this stage you should stick with the
          yard trash. Kill beetles, TDs, Greater Skels and Jacks. Some Jacks
          will be tough, even for a full group. Personally, I think that the
          Jacks are the most fun MOB in the game - hilarious pumpkin headed
          suckas. Get ready to run when you look down and see 10 beetles at your
          feet. They are meaner than they look. The best place to pull to will
          most likely be around Gazebo on the right side of the house. This area
          is literally crawling with low level critters and you are close enough
          to the zone to make a run for it. This is also the least likely place
          to get trained by high level MOBs.</p>
          <p><strong>Levels 17-18</strong><br>
          If your group is on the high end of the 15-18 range, you may want to
          try your hands at pulling from the first floor of the house. Be
          careful though, it is very easy to end up with more than you wanted to
          pull. Try out a few Dark Bones and Ghouls and see how you do. Then
          move on to Mummies. Remember, some of these guys take a magical weapon
          to hit, so if your tanks don't have a magical hitter, you're gonna be
          in trouble. Also, the puller should always be ready for that
          unexpected Hag or Werebat to be wandering around on the first floor.
          These do not spawn here but may be returning to their rooms after
          someone pulled them and then zoned. When you first start playing with
          the house creatures, get ready to run a lot.</p>
          <p><strong>Levels 19-25</strong>:<br>
          As a level 19+ Cleric in an undead zone, you will be in demand. You
          have some strong buff and healing spells as well as some decent
          undead-nukers. Use this to your advantage and work your way into some
          20+ groups. The experience and loot will be much better. This is when
          Unrest gets fun. These groups will be taking on the second and third
          floor MOBs. Make sure to heal first and nuke second unless you have a
          few Clerics. Always keep Hag watch for your group. If you see
          someone's health plummet, there is a good chance a Hag has attached
          itself to the puller. Hags like to come out of the house late in the
          battle and start casting from afar. Shout it to your party and have
          them rush her. If they don't react quickly, your puller is going to
          die. Always try and have at least two clerics in the group. One is the
          primary healer, the other nukes a bit but holds some mana back for
          heals as well. You will now want to start pulling to the left-side or
          back of the house to avoid the lower level creatures that will still
          attach themselves to your pullls at times. Also, there are some sites
          and people who suggest pulling to the front of the zone near the
          fountains. I assume that this is so you can zone faster if you pull
          too much. I maintain that this is a very bad idea as up there you are
          in &quot;train alley&quot; and will constantly have others group's
          trains attaching themselves to your fights. I hate to waste time
          zoning to get away from other people's mistakes.</p>
          <p><strong>Level 25+ (campers?)</strong>:<br>
          This is where you will have to make a decision. A 25+ group is fully
          capable of camping any room in the house. Most people have an aversion
          to camping. However, most of us have had to get over this due to the
          fact that if we don't, someone else will and we will not have anything
          to pull. You may not agree, but camping is a way of life in all decent
          zones these days. Poke your head into the throne room in Cazic-Thule
          to find the same group that was there 7 hours ago. So here it is -
          either pull from the second floor, third floor and basement if they
          are not all taken by groups, or camp a room. It is up to you and your
          group. I would suggest not taking a seat in the basement until the
          group is around level 28 or so. At level 28+ we would sit in the
          basement for hours and I have not seen better experience for that
          level anywhere else in the game. But it gets rough down there and
          spawns have a way of hitting all at once. But since the only actual
          special MOB in the basement is Garanel and most people are not of the
          level to mess with him, we did not anger many people by camping that
          area.</p>
          <p>Around level 30, experience becomes hard to get in Unrest unless
          you sit in the basement. At 30 most people move on to Cazic or other
          zones.</p>
          <p>This has gotten very long and I hope I have covered most of the
          zone without making too many errors.</p>
          <p>Lots of luck to you all,</p>
