Simply have a lvl 50 druid cast a dmg shield that does 24 dmg to anything that hits you and buff your strength ac and HP up and give you SoW.<p>He heals you if you get low and kills it after you kill it halfway.<p>Or have an enchanter cast a rune type shield (like beserker str to save costs) and a speed spell on you.  Then he mem blurs it (like atone) and you do the final blow.<p>Magician same thing dmg shield...<p>Problem is you have crappy skills in the end.  We took a player to lvl 5 last night in less then an hour of a magicians time. His 1HB-5 2HB-1 his spells skills are just as bad. Same with offense/defense<p>In other words you will have to pamper then even after they are lvl 30 until they grow into thier lvls.  However if they have a base like Darur they already have weapon skills etc... and at high lvls the twinking is no where near efficent so it is just like giving him a decent edge.  He could solo light reds with a friend... consistantly with little down time.<p>We (my guild not I personally) had our lvl 3 cleric kill a scarab.  Thats good xp for a lvl 3.<p>He already has several characters in the late teens....but he wanted to change classes to help the guild...and if anyone is going to change classes it won't be our lvl 30+ since we like our 30+ and will still need them.  For example we considered power-lvl'ing me from 21 up to mid 30's....but then when we go to do nagafen later who will I be? Enchanter or Cleric? Both are needed and my enchanter is lvl 35.  We chose to grab our lower lvl members and ask them...one did switch.  I think we need several.  The offer is currently only for Dalur.
