Well, as far as I can tell, it is. Here's my story:<p>I saw the loc on the Ingot of the Penitent here (thanks, btw), monitored the right water pillar in Guk for SIX HOURS, then grabbed it. Yay, I'm happy. Off to Kerra Ridge since the Icon of the Penitent is there and then I can complete one of the quests tonight! So I go to Kerra Ridge, over to the Heretic Island and lo and behold right away I see Maugrim (sp?) walking around. Nuke her, lose some faction with Bertox, and take her Icon of the Penitent.<p>So, at this point I have both the Ingot AND the Icon of the Penitent, quest almost complete. A quick run to the temple to check how many bars of enchanted plat I need. Answer: 2. Run to Neriak and buy 2 bars of Platinum. Get a ride to Cazic Thule to meet my Enchanter friend, and get the Bars enchanted. So at this point I have EVERYTHING I need for the quest: The Ingot of the Penitent, the Icon of the Penitent, and 2 Bars of Enchanted Platinum, JUST what doctor Blaize ordered.<p>So, merrily I go to the Temple of Solusek Ro, and run through the dialogue with Blaize AGAIN, to make sure I have the right stuff. I inspect each of the items to make sure I have what I need. I Run through the dialogue ("what ingots and icons" followed by "what penitent"). I do NOT like screwing up quests, I'm extremely careful and I'm not a dumbass, so I carefully line up everything she wants in the Give Window. I even put the in the Order she asked for, from top to bottom: Ingot of the Penitent, Icon of the Penitent, 1 bar of enchanted platinum, another bar of enchanted platinum (yes, I separated the bars, filling out all 4 Give Slots, similar to the way I have gotten the Crafted Bplate). I inspect all the items AGAIN to make sure they are right, and match up each item with the text she had just said to make sure each item was correct.
