1: yes you can go to runneye and solo knight and king and warlord with out to much of problem from a train.  I use calm or soothe i forget which one and then attack named gob with a club not a nuke.  You may get named and one more that you can drag back to zone and wax with wrath.   One important thing after killing both zone to get off the gobs you soothe argo list.  Best way to atack is stun then nuke stun then nuke 8)  I have gotten two bibs and 2 crows and some blackedn armor one piece being boots 8)  Now my warrior can kick ghouls ). <br>2: MM to solo, I wouldn't trains are nasty and the DE boogers still attack you even though the are green.<br>
