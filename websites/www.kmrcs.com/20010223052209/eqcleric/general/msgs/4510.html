If AC is the only consideration the Mithril sounds better.

One reaon  is the high<br>: agil bonus (+15) doesnt really help us dwarfs out that much since ours is so low to begin with. Ive seen some high level clerics chose BE BP over the Mith<br>: cause its higher AC. Manastone and rubi go together VERY well. So dont even think of making this trade.<p>
