Please people stop posting childish messages.  I would like this board to go back to just cleric talk.  Rayne I hope you start the other mesage board soon so you can canecel the accounts of the distasteful posts.  Come on, do you think a bard can keep a party alive in a lower guk or sol b when all hell breaks loose NO. Can a bard and a cleric fighting together improve a teams abilities HELL YES.  Do we care about a persons sexual habits on here NO.  I feel this board is for Cleric spefic talk ie quest, information on where to find things.  God people stop the flames.  It is not wanted on this board in my opionion.
