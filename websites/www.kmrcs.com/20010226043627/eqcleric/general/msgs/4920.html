Greetings, I posted here earlier today about where a level 21 should hunt.  Going with the advice I got from here I decided to go to Lake Rathetear (and I must say it is GREAT there.)  While I was there someone mentioned that there are "Hidden Factions".  For example, Aviaks, They are Dubious to me but according to him if I kill to many I will be KOS by them.  Now when I do kill an Aviak it doesn't say there are ANY faction hits, not a single one.  Now I was wondering if this was true or not.  If it is I will stick to the undead at the SK zone and stay away from the Aviaks.  Anyone know if its true or not?<p>Ziggy,<br>Healer of Tunare<br>Veeshan
