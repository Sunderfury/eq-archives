Well here are the links to a map that i have found usefull. http://www.gameznet.com/eq/maps/UgukA.GIF<br>http://www.gameznet.com/eq/maps/UgukB.GIF<p>Now on the map  Ugukb.gif on the upper right hand side you will see a pond with a zone on top and the lower right side of the pond.  In the middle you will see an ilsand off to the right with two T's.  That is where the gator spawns. Reports say it spawns every 4 to 5 hours but I have had it spawn twice in one hour then not four another day.  Go figure 8).  By the way take at least one or two more to kill the crocs. I can solo the croc at 34 but he still bites hard.  Oh the saltwater crocs will spawn in groups but dont worry you can pull one croc at a time, they are not linked.  <p>Good luck<br>Xene
