: I hear what you are saying...but you make it sound as if Verant has a hidden agenda to screw halflings.  It was a simple human error.  Granted, it is extremely frustrating (I got my boots of reliant last night and found out the hard way).  If you actually look at the boots, they have HEF instead of HLF.  Clearly, this is a bug since HEF's can't be clerics.  I /bug it and will speak with a GM about it today.  Hang in there (if you have any endurance left from camping the diary and ignot).<p>: Othar Tazmania<p>
