The following was the ceremony I wrote and used numerous times when I acted as the priestess in another online game.  All of my couples seemed to enjoy it.  I've modified the names so it fits with EQ.  I suggest you let the bride plan all the particulars and go along with whatever she wants within reason (grin).  Crowd control is sometimes a problem so prepare a "/shout" macro to calm things down and lean heavily on those who don't comply -- usually your best tool is humor, so use it liberally.  The brides get real upset and the grooms go ballistic when things go wrong.  I sometimes gave small gifts to the bride and groom, too, and if I knew the players personally, would give a very brief talk about them (relating funny hunting anecdotes, etc.).<p>Good luck to you!<br>Best, <br>Maaggie of Xegony<p>DEARLY BELOVED CITIZENS OF NORRATH:<p>WE ARE GATHERED TOGETHER TO JOIN THIS <WIZARD,  CLERIC, PALADIN, ETC.> AND THIS <ENCHANTER, RANGER, BARD, ETC.> IN  EQ-MATRIMONY.<p>AS YOU KNOW, MARRIAGE IN ALL ITS FORMS COMES WITH INHERENT RESPONSIBILITIES.<p>HERE IN EVERQUEST, HOWEVER, IN ADDITION TO LOVE, HONOR AND SUPPORT, THERE ARE EXTRA OBLIGATIONS:<p><GROOM>, DO YOU PROMISE TO ALWAYS HELP RECOVER <BRIDE>'S CORPSE,  NO MATTER HOW DANGEROUS IT MAY BE?<p><BRIDE>, DO YOU PROMISE TO BE GENEROUS WITH THE CONTENTS OF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IN THE EVENT THAT <GROOM> MEETS WITH AN UNTIMELY DEMISE?<p><GROOM>, DO YOU PROMISE TO OFFER THAT UNSTINTING SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT, AND THOSE LITTLE COMPLIMENTS SO NECESSARY TO THE FEMALE HEART, WHENEVER <BRIDE> MAY NEED THEM?<p><BRIDE>, DO YOU PROMISE TO OFFER THAT UNSTINTING PRAISE, SUPPORT AND APPROVAL,  SO NECESSARY TO THE MALE EGO, WHENEVER <GROOM> MAY NEED THEM?<p><GROOM> AND <BRIDE>, DO YOU PLEDGE TO FAVOR YOUR SPOUSE AMONG ALL OTHERS WHEN CHOOSING HUNTING COMPANIONS? <p>DO YOU PROMISE TO SHARE WITH YOUR SPOUSE THE SPOILS OF ALL YOUR HUNTS?<p>DO YOU PROMISE TO ALWAYS AVENGE THE DEATH OF YOUR SPOUSE?<p>THEN, IN THE NAME OF THE GODS OF NORRATH, AND THE IN SPIRIT OF FAIR PLAY AND EXCELLENT GAMESMANSHIP, <p>I HEREBY PRONOUNCE YOU, <GROOM> AND <BRIDE>, EQ-MAN AND EQ-WIFE!  <GROOM,> YOU MAY KISS YOUR BRIDE!!<br> <br>: I'm to perform a wedding, and I have no clue as to<br>: how to go about it.
