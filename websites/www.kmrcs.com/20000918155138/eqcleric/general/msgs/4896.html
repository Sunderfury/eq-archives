I think you're doing just fine!  I'm the same level as you are and have different, but comparable stuff, except that I probably have more banded than bronze because of the weight (hey! outside I may *look* like a wimpy high-elf weakling, but inside... I'm a wimpy high-elf weakling) (who is already VERY unhappy that she sank way too many of her bonus creation points into strength rather than wisom) (I'd rather be weak than unwise... alas, at this point, I'm both) (even with the + stuff I already have, my wis is only at 126 and my strength at 86).<p>I still have my Apron, I don't have the BI Medallion (heh... a +3 str collar instead), I still have my S-Mace, I have a polished (chipped?... not sure which) bone bracer (from the Evil Eye in East Karana), two +2 wis jasper rings, chiton shell shield (I *really* like the way this looks), and two +3 wis jasper earrings (which cost me a pretty penny!).  I have one or two barbed pieces... legs and arms, I think.  The rest is banded with one bronze wrist and I think a bronze faceplate.<p>My next to-die-for (probably literally) items are Bloodstained Tunic and Savant's cap... either that or save up for plate.  Sigh.  The Charred Guardian Shield is still, alas, just a dream.  I can't seem to get anyone to show me around SolA.
