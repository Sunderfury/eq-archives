This info is pretty much right on. I got both the book from the cabin and the ingot from the tree stump after about 10 hours of camping. I chose the brute force method of just waiting until they appeared. Other clerics tried to wait and time the spawns, but by the time they got there, there were already people there, so your best best is too wait it out. Of course the boots are the simplest things to get so they will be more popular than the other items at first.<br>Alliliel, Cleric of Tunare, Tunare Server<p>: You'll find the diary of Turgan the Reliant in a burned out cabin close to the zone border between Rivervale and West Commons.  I think you have to give this diary to Turgan when you find him in Lake Rathetear; not sure.  The Ingot of the Reliant is found on top of a tree stump at loc -89, 3269; you have to jump to the stump from a fallen tree.<p><br>
