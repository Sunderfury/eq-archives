Let's not forget that this is a positive step in the right direction.  GM run quests and NPCs are a BLAST!  I had a GM owned werewolf slaughter a bunch of us at WC yelling curses everywhere we went one evening.  Now that was fun!  The whole zone even went into RP mode with trying to calm the human beneath the wolf's skin!  You know what?  It worked!  All those involved got some minor tokens of appreciation for their assistance.  I was really not so concerned with my personal gain and I feel neither was anyone else.  It added variety to the normal game evening.  Another time, in Oasis of Marr, a GM possesed a specter.  Talk about chaos!  I was plenty far away shouting coordinates of the monster when it turned on me screaming "Grott!  I shall dine on thy soul!"  Talk about adrenaline rushes!  Anyways, my point is I'm sure that these quests might affect some user's request for a corpse move for a short while, but that shouldn't be a reason for us to look at these special events negativly.  If I wanted to get some negative vibes even when good things were done, I'd visit the newsgroups! )<p>Grott Forgeheart<br>Dwarven Cleric of Brell<br>Tarrew Marr<br>
