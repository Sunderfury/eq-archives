I also have been on the end of those days when someone yells for the heal but you just dont get it there in time cause everyone is going down.  Even today I had the worst thing happen.  Oh I am a 34th lvl cleric.  I went back to the zone to pick up our 6th payer.  Ok in lower guk you need to be invis undead to move around, well I am not sure if my friend was reappearing or not but as soon as we got around the corner and headed for the sage room the savants room unloaded on him. (2 war wizes and 3 war knights) Well what did I do,  Unfortunatley my wiser side got the best of me and I let him die.  If i had healed him my whole group would have died.  I sent him a tell to consent to me so i could drag him to the room where we were camped and I resed him.  I apologized for not healng him and he understood, I also got a big thank you from him for helping him get his body back.  Of course resing is easy and I did it with out a thought.  So there will be time where you get yelled at but if one individual gets on you nerves make it a point to heal him last sooner or later the yelling will stop and if not explain to him he will die with out you and if he keeps yelling expalin to him that you will not heal him anymore till he understands that you are trying.  You have control dont let them push you around.  This is a cocky statement but where I go and when I yell to see who needs a cleric most of the time it is the high lvls calling me in to group with them..  Ie 40th lvls want me a 34 lvl cleric.  So stay in control if the group is to bad disband and find a new one.  There is always good groups somewhere.<p>Keep the heals flowing <p>Xene
