: Seems like in just about every thread on this board someone makes a statement about clerics not being able to solo. I don't get it.

: I'm 27th, which is about the worst time to solo seeing as I'm still using my DD spell I got at 14. Still, I can solo aviak harriers (high blue to me) and other blues with little threat of death. Obviously, undead are even easier - I can easily solo white.

: Admittedly, I've only dabbled with other classes - 5th lvl bard is my highest (though I spent a day playing a friend's low 20's warrior). Is it that much easier to solo with them? I don't have any problems soloing if I can't find a group (rare) or don't have the time to join a group.

: I know there is downtime after soloing, but I know from playing the warrior that it's no worse than theirs.

: Soloing my be inconvenient (because of downtime) but it is by no means, IMO, impossible or even that difficult.
