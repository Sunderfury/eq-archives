 Even if it's the case that we have to go after <br>named NPCs to complete these quests, the fact of<br>the matter is that we'll be competing only against<br>other clerics for the quest items, and all of the<br>items won't be next to each other.  At any given <br>time, how many clerics will be searching for one<br>component of one of the armor quests?  <p> Probably not that many ... if any.  That's not<br>the same situation as people from 5 or 6 different<br>classes all going to the same dungeon to kill<br>the same rare spawns at all.<p> More importantly, nobody will be farming this<br>armor because there won't be a large market for<br>it (only clerics) and because you have to gather<br>multiple items to get one piece of armor.  You'll<br>also have to use an enchanted platinum bar to <br>get it, making farming it less profitable.  Level<br>50 wizards will have better luck hanging out in<br>dungeons farming easier stuff.
