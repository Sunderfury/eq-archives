I'm with Tomma on this, you'll never get anything from me.<p>For the person who asked the question: <br>My general policy is that if it's casual loot in a party I don't know, I usually don't symbol.  My party I always symbol when necessary.  Sometimes the party holds back money for me for gems.  Sometimes they buy them for me.  In any case, I don't ask for money or gems in compensation.  We're all there to help each other.  Whether I make a profit or even a loss for the night I know they will take care of me.<p>Lucretia Rialsq<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Bristlebane
