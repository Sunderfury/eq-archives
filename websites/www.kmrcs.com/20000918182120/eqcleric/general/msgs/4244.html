One of my pet gripes -- they obviously spent lots of time developing the quest and the item.  Why not spend some of that time developing the new zones -- or make the game better for all of us instead of just one person?<br>Basically, if you weren't online at the time of the quest -- heck, if you weren't in the zone or didn't have friends there -- you were out of luck.  And by using so many gm's, how many will be online around that timeframe for normal routine items -- corpse retrievals and so on?  Sunday morning a poor sap in sol a had petitioned a gm before I got there -- not finding a group, I camped and tried again several hours later... he was still petitioning.  <p>I am glad to see dynamic quests -- but they impact so few!  What about the other 1470 of us?<p>Just my 2 cp,<br>Erondil
