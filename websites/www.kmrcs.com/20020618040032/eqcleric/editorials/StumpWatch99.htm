          <hr>
          <p align="center"><i>or what Verant should do about our armor quests</i></p>
          <p>This editorial is not a rant directed at Verant; instead, it is a
          list of what Verant did right and what they didn't do right in
          implementing the new quests, specifically the cleric quests.&nbsp; It
          also contains a list of suggestions that would, in my opinion, improve
          both the cleric quests and the overall game.&nbsp; Furthermore, this
          is not a petition.&nbsp; There is a petition on the net, available at <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~remage/" style="color: #0000FF">http://www.mindspring.com/~remage/
          </a>.&nbsp; I agree with many of the points, but not all.&nbsp; I also
          don't agree with the tone of the petition.</p>
          <p>This weekend I had the distinct &quot;pleasure&quot; to participate
          in what I call <i>Stump Watch 99.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; What is <i>Stump
          Watch</i> you ask?&nbsp; It is a name derived from some our quests,
          one of which has an item that spawns on top of a stump in Kithicor
          forest.&nbsp; What can be easier than picking up an item off the
          ground?&nbsp; Nothing, except that the item only spawns approximately
          every 7 hours.&nbsp; While participating in my own little segment of <i>Stump
          Watch</i> I had ample opportunity to not only read a lot of
          class-specific message boards, but also think about the quests and
          what could be done to improve them.</p>
          <p><b><u><font size="4">What is good about the quests</font></u></b></p>
          <p>Nothing.&nbsp; Well, ok, seriously, there are some very good
          aspects to the quests.&nbsp; One is that players are extremely spread
          out at the moment.&nbsp; For example, there have been 30+ players
          actively hunting in Dagnor's Cauldron the last few nights.&nbsp; How
          often has the cauldron been used as anything other than a place to
          pass through on the way to Unrest?&nbsp; Anything Verant can do to
          increase utilization of all the zones is a good thing.</p>
          <p>Secondly, some of these quests are a lot of fun.&nbsp; I have
          helped two ranger friends complete four Ivy Bracers.&nbsp; This is a
          good quest.&nbsp; The mobs spawn frequently (Redwind seems to spawn
          every 10 - 15 minutes) and many of the surrounding mobs gave me
          experience.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to the Ivy Tunic quest.&nbsp; I <b>much</b>
          prefer working on these quests than I would camping Rubicite.&nbsp;
          Sure, there will still be camping queues, but so far the ones I've
          participated in have been orderly and cordial.&nbsp; There was a
          certain amount of camaraderie displayed; I didn't feel the competition
          I normally feel at heavily contested spawn spots.&nbsp; This quest is
          a prime example of how they all should be.</p>
          <p><b><u><font size="4">What is not good about the quests</font></u></b></p>
          <p>First, many clerics are upset that the armor doesn't have better
          stats, specifically that it doesn't have more increases to wisdom.&nbsp;
          To an extent I agree; however, with one exception this armor is
          generally better than Rubicite.&nbsp; The one exception is the
          Rubicite Breastplate with the <i>Healing Aura</i> which I'll address
          later.&nbsp; The new bracers increase Wisdom by 5 each (for a total
          increase of 10).&nbsp; None of the other classes are getting better
          increases to their prime attributes.&nbsp; The disappointing part for
          us is that it comes on bracers.&nbsp; I personally would have much
          preferred that it be 5 each on the tunic and greaves.&nbsp; The
          increase of AC on those two items would have been much more valuable
          than on bracers.&nbsp; I think we need to cut Verant a bit of slack on
          the armor.&nbsp; Keep in mind they never promised us a pre-Plane of
          Fear suit.&nbsp; They promised class specific replacement armor for
          Rubicite.&nbsp; While it could have been better, it isn't awful
          either; it just isn't particularly desirable for a cleric interested
          in maximizing wisdom (and neither was Rubicite).</p>
          <p>Second, let me address the issue of <i>Stump Watch</i>.&nbsp; Or <i>Cabin
          Watch </i>or <i>Water Watch.</i>&nbsp; All three of these were a bad
          idea.&nbsp; A <b>real bad<i> </i></b>idea.&nbsp; The idea of quests,
          and the game, is to have fun.&nbsp; Dear Verant, nobody, and I mean <b>nobody<i>,
          </i></b>can tell me that watching a patch of static scenery for hours
          at a time is fun.&nbsp; Many of us players want to do the quests, and
          some of us will tolerate whatever you do in order to complete them,
          but please, re-think this one.&nbsp; If the seven hour spawn cycle is
          part of some master plan to keep down the quest armor count that's one
          thing, but give us a mob to kill.&nbsp; Better yet, why can't our
          quests be more like other class's quests.&nbsp; For example, to get
          the warrior greaves we went to Najena to kill Trazdon.&nbsp; Two hours
          later we left with the Dark Circlet necessary to complete the quest.&nbsp;
          By the way, the first hour was spent waiting for our turn.&nbsp; He
          spawned every 20 - 30 minutes.&nbsp; Most of the crafted items don't
          even require a named mob to be killed, just a specific type of mob who
          has a chance of dropping the item.&nbsp; Why are clerical quests
          different?&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Third, alright, if <i>Stump Watch</i> isn't bad enough, who decided
          it would be a good idea to put the best wisdom enhancing item in the
          game on one of our quest mobs?&nbsp; Specifically Bilge, a mid 30s
          aqua goblin in Dagnor's Cauldron, drops either a +18 Wisdom totem or a
          +5 Wisdom belt along with our icon (or ingot? who cares).&nbsp; Come
          on Verant, don't make us compete with higher level players.&nbsp;
          After all, what do you think the life expectancy of that mob is going
          to be?&nbsp; If we aren't around when Bilge is dropped that's it,
          another six hours down the drain.&nbsp; What if the player who takes
          Bilge out doesn't even know about the quest?&nbsp; This is silly.&nbsp;
          I also hear Bilge runs real fast.&nbsp; It sounds to me as if this mob
          is <i>designed</i> for druids and shamans.</p>
          <p>Fourth, um, gee, thanks for giving us replacement armor for
          Rubicite, but, well, I want a chance at a breastplate too.&nbsp; The
          consequences of this decision are: Rubicite Breastplates are
          practically priceless now (I'm sure those who have one must be
          pleased) and Verant rewarded those who concentrated on leveling more
          quickly.&nbsp; Conversely, they punished the slower leveling players
          by removing their opportunity to acquire one of the premier items in
          the game.&nbsp; Not a good idea Verant.</p>
          <p><u><b>What do I recommend</b></u></p>
          <p>1) Eliminate <i>Stump Watch.&nbsp; </i>Specifically, make our
          quests much more similar to the warrior's crafted quests.&nbsp;
          Furthermore, don't make us track rare spawns (rare being one every 6
          hours).&nbsp; Put our items on regular mobs and work out a percentage
          of that item being dropped.&nbsp; Our items are hardly special enough
          to justify the time involved.</p>
          <p>2) Take our items off named NPCs such as Bilge.&nbsp; Instead,
          implement #1.</p>
          <p>3) Put Rubicite <b>back</b> into the game.&nbsp; Just make it an
          extremely rare drop off high level (35+) mobs similar to the Box of
          Abu Kar and Black Pearls.&nbsp; It is unfair that those who do not
          level as fast (for whatever reason) lose out on the opportunity to
          loot the Rubicite Breastplate.</p>
          <p>4) Consider reworking the stat buffs on the armor a bit.&nbsp;
          Specifically for the cleric class, put the wisdom enhancements on the
          tunic and greaves.&nbsp; The existing wisdom-enhancing bracers are
          easily acquired, so putting the wisdom enhancement on the quest armor
          bracers is very disappointing.&nbsp; Let us clerics interested in
          enhancing wisdom wear plate on our chest and legs.&nbsp; That would be
          an outstanding reward for doing the quests.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
