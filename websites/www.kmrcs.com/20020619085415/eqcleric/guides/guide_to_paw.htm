            <p>Tired of fighting undead? Need a change of pace from Faydwer.
            Come to the balmy South Karanas and visit the canine environs of the
            Infected Paw. Hang out with those lovable puppies Ren Rexx and Phido.
            Have a &quot;charm&quot;ing conversation with that dark elf Zixx
            Nenix. See the awesome spectacles of the mighty Hill Giants, the
            majestic Griffins (as they chase you to the zone line at the
            bridge), or the terrible Cyclops (as they chase you back to the
            other side). Hail Lord Grimrot and ask him for help with those
            putrid skeletons (yep, did that one too). Learn the shorelines of
            North and West Karanas and the rolling beauty of the Qeynos Hills
            (as you run back to Paw to from Qeynos to recover your corpse).</p>
            <p>===End of advertisement===</p>
            <p>While I would hardly call this dungeon a Cleric's Paradise it was
            a lot of fun, was generally empty (maybe 10-15 players most nights
            during prime-time) and has a few sought after items: the Runed Totem
            Staff (+5 hps, +5 mana, 9/37) and various pieces of Snakeskin Armor
            (jerkins are AC9, +5 resist poison, gloves +3 dex, etc). After
            dealing with the sometimes crowded Befallen (can be bad when 20 out
            of 30 players are on level 2), it was a refreshing change of pace.
            We started with just a 15 warrior, 14 ranger, and 15 cleric. Our
            group has expanded to 3 rangers (two 15, one 14), a wizard (13), the
            warrior and cleric (finally both 16). I much prefer this dungeon
            with a large party. While most individual fights are easy (with the
            exception of some of the boss mobs), things do have a way of
            accumulating and after a while numbers of mobs do matter. It also
            forced us to refine our tactics, or should I say finally deploy
            some? By applying the tips I've gathered here in Paw we have become
            a much better team. For the vast majority of the dungeon we were too
            high a level to benefit experience-wise. I really wish I had hit the
            place at about level 12 or 13. The experience would have been great
            at that level. At 15, it took over a week to level, but a lot of
            that is of course dictated by many factors (number of players,
            someone dying, etc). I think with the experience we now have of the
            place we could do it in about three nights, but the conditions would
            have to be optimal - a good group and an empty dungeon.</p>
            <p><strong>The dog-kennel</strong>:</p>
            <p><strong>Gnolls</strong>: There are low-level gnolls scattered
            throughout the dungeon. They ignored us with the rare exception of
            one tagging someone while meditating. I'd guess their levels to be 5
            - 7 (based upon the levels of some of the low level players I saw
            playing with them).<br>
            <strong>Loot</strong>: Not sure about loot; never bothered to loot
            one.</p>
            <p><strong>Guards</strong>: Next up on the barking order are the
            guards. These must hover around 10. I say this because about 1 out
            of 4 would attack me from behind; most did ignore me. Once I hit 16
            not one guard took a swing. I've read that their is a 5 level
            break-off where hostile monsters ignore you. That could be it.<br>
            <strong>Loot</strong>: Sometimes gold, rusty weapons, cloth armor.
            At a lower level I wouldn't have passed them up, but one issue with
            Paw is because it is so far from a bank (nearest are Qeynos and
            Rivervale - Rivervale not the easiest run) I was always very picky
            with what I kept. I never kept rustys for example.</p>
            <p><strong>Shamans</strong>: I believe they were also around level
            10. Every shaman I saw was green to me at 15; the 14th level player
            said he occasionally came across a blue one. When alone they are not
            difficult; however, they are rarely alone. You usually find multiple
            shamans with a guard or two. They are also often linked to higher
            level mobs (e.g. nobles, captains, and high-shamans) whom they buff
            and heal (minor heals). Our group of three had little trouble wiping
            out four simultaneously along with a guard or two.<br>
            <strong>Loot</strong>: Mostly the same as guards with the added
            bonus of the occasional wooden-totem. These are little dolls one
            equips in a weapon spot. They confer +5 mana. I'm not sure what they
            are worth; rumor has it maybe 2 plat from a player.</p>
            <p><strong>Nobles</strong>: These guys must average around level 12.
            Most of them were blue to me; occasionally I would run across a
            greenie. These are the first serious mobs for teen-level groups.
            They are never alone; there is always another noble or shaman,
            sometimes with a guard. They are also sometimes guards for
            higher-level mobs (the high shamans).<br>
            <strong>Loot</strong>: Snakeskin armor is what one kills nobles for.
            We obtained it about 1/10 or so mobs.</p>
            <p><strong>Captain/Commander</strong>: Spank these puppies first.
            They are level 13/14 and they hit hard. The captain hangs out with
            two nobles in the Lenrel area and has a shaman for backup. The
            commanders hang out with Ren Rex. Depending upon the spawn you can
            catch the commanders solo. I'd recommend you try unless you have a
            good group.<br>
            <strong>Loot</strong>: Same as nobles.</p>
            <p><strong>High Shamans</strong>: These are Ren Rex, Lenrel, Grisok
            and Phido (who naked their dog Grisok?). Rex and Lenrel ranged from
            levels 14-16 (blue to yellow). Grisok and Phido were invariably red
            to me at 15. Rex (and Phido) typically has a commander and a shaman
            in the room with him. Lenrel (and Grisok) has a noble and a shaman.
            Otherwise, the fights were not too difficult.<br>
            <strong>Loot</strong>: They drop the aforementioned Runed Totem
            Staff. The staffs are pretty rare spawns. For seven nights we picked
            up no staffs after downing countless incarnations of Lenrel. We get
            one on a Saturday night. On Sunday night we pick up three (two in a
            row off Lenrel). Sometimes you get lucky :). Also, the heads are
            needed for one of the monk quests.</p>
            <p><strong>Ghanex Drah</strong>: This is a (usually) level 16 Gnoll
            Necro. His pet would usually be white also. Also in the room would
            be two skeletons and two zombies guard the door. It is normally
            possible to take the zombies out first before engaging the rest of
            the room.<br>
            <strong>Loot</strong>: He drops random items. We have recovered a
            number of bronze spears from him. Also, I got extraordinarily lucky
            and got a Polished Bone Hoop earring which is +10 mana. He also
            leaves behind a head.</p>
            <p><strong>Zixx Nenix</strong>: He's a dark-elf necro whose level
            must be at least 20. His pet was red to me at 15 (four of us could
            take the pet, but not an easy fight). Generally if you saw him the
            best thing to do would be run. He does cast Charm in addition to
            other nasty things. One time the whole dungeon ganged on him, but it
            took over 10 players (of our level) to drop him. He charmed a few of
            the higher levels during the fight to keep things interesting.
            Fortunately he is a rare spawn.<br>
            <strong>Loot</strong>: Good question, maybe one day I'll find out.</p>
            <p>I could go into some specific tactics for the rooms, but the main
            thing to keep in mind is let nothing escape. If the dungeon is not
            being constantly swept by players (which is rare, some nights are
            party of 6 were the only ones in - PRIME TIME HOURS) the mobs will
            return with shamans healing them and guards to help. If I had ever
            questioned the value of root, Paw made a believer out of me. I hope
            this provides some value to those of you interested in a different
            place. It was fun to write up.</p>
