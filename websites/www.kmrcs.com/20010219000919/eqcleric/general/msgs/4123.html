Was running around yesterday and passed a guy near a the beholder zone.  I get a tell a few minutes later asking for a res since he just died there.  Takes me a few mintues to get there, and I give him a lev 39 res.  I get this message that its not successful and I could try again later, so all in all it took 3 casts and finally he got teleported.<p>I have noticed that XP restored is not consistent.  I have used the lev 39 spell and it seems to vary from almost nothing to almost half of the lost xp restored.<p>I also had some problems whereby once I ressurect someone, they appear invisible to me, and I can no longer see corpses on the ground (have to camp and log back in.  This only happened once though).<p><p>
