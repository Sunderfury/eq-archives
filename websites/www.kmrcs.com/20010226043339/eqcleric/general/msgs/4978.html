: <br>: A battle is not a foregone conclusion.  If your taking on anything but<br>: easy kills (in which case why are you grouping to begin with) then sometimes<br>: things go wrong.  Your warrior misses for 5 rounds in a row. you get 3 resists in a row<br>: on your DD spell, whatever.  In this case a normally predictable fight becomes a nailbiter.<br>: This is when sow, (or gate, but your cleric can't gate you can he) really helps out.<p>And that's exactly the point... your druid gets a couple of DDs resisted and you have small run of bad rounds, and you're screwed - running is your only option. Now replace druid with cleric. No mana is wasted because the cleric isn't casting DDs. You (the warrior) will have to have a serious run of bad rounds before the situation gets bad enough to run. In the best situation, the druid may be better, but if anything goes wrong, you're better off with the cleric (unless you like to run away a lot). I prefer to plan for the worst case.<p>A side point: I read on this board a lot about how worthless a cleric is in melee. I'm 27th, my warrior partner 26th (and no slouch). I still do 1/4 to 1/5 of the damage if we both melee. 20 to 25 percent over the course of a battle makes a difference! (I use an Obs staff and usually hit for 24 in the time that she gets two hits for about 75-80). With my warrior being the tauntmaster that she is, I can melee, step back and heal as needed, and jump back into melee. We often take on things red to her and yellow to me without ever running.<p><p>
