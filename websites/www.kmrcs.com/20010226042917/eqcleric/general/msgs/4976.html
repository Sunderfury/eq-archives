In case you have not gotten the ring yet, here is what I did:<p>Apparently Gynok spawns in a wandering mob spot. And to get him to spawn, you need to kill the mob that spawned there and continue killing mobs that spawn thereafter. <p>What I did is had a friend watch the spot as I roamed the whole upper level and started killing all the mobs till he saw one spawn in his spot. Then we focussed on killing mobs that spawned in his spot only.<p>I had Gynok spawn on me 3 times by doing this and each time I waited no more than 2hrs. This is just a theory on his spawns, but it did work on me 3 times. I died twice trying to kill him cause I had no back up, hehe.<p>
