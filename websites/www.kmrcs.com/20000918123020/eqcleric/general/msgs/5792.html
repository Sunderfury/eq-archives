: I just hit Level 24 yesterday (Joy)... <p>: Well anyhow things were going good for the most part with the<br>: group I was with then people started coming and going.

I had now<br>: over 2 bubbles into 24.  Joined a 3rd group comprised of 3 Wizards<br>: and another cleric and a level 21 paladin.  Wizards ranged from<br>: 24 - 27.  Thought I was gonna be ok if we didn't pull too much<br>: which is always a risk with Unrest.  Well first pull the puller<br>: gets rooted inside.  So I go in with the Level 27 wizard.  I give<br>: the puller a greater heal as he's down to bubble of life, then<br>: I try to run out.  I'm rooted at door and killed and <br>: group members all run and leave me other than the 22 cleric.<br>: So I'm kinda ticked off!

Well level 27 wizzie is in deep trouble<br>: so I cast greater heal saving him, but pulling 3 carrions<br>: onto me with no one helping me again, other than 22 cleric.<p>: I die, everyone else lives.  Should I not use greater heal<br>: in battle when there are lots of mobs?  Should I just yell run<br>: and save myself instead of saving others?  Seemed all wizzies<br>: only cared about themself?
