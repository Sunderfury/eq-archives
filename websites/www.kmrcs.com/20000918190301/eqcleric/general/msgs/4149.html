: I think WoH in general is a very underrated spell... In a full group, you can do over 600 healing for only 30 more mana than greater heal. But I have never seen anybody outside of my normal group ever use this spell.<p>I use somtimes, it's fairly good if everyone has taken a bit of a beating. The problem is while is does a fairly good job on pure casters, less so to priest types, it doesnt make much of a impact on tanks. It's also nice becouse you dont have to taget anyone to cast it ;)
