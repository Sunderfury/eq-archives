<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Go to Regis the Reverent's Girl 
friend a Gypsy named Lianna Ferasa she is found in the Rathe Mtns (Loc 3982.16, 
1464.10). Ask her "What has become of Regis" She will tell you that Regis was 
slain by Zahal the Vile.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"> She wants you to go to North Karana and kill Zahal (he 
is a level 16 Ghoul) to free the soul of Regis and return her Flute to her. 
Zahal can be found over by the Treant in NK, he is rare spawn.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">After you kill 
him go To the Northern Tree line to the East and look for Regis (Loc 1499.59, 
-1511.01) he should be a level 28 Zombie. Kill Regis (Don’t ask me why you have 
to kill the poor guy you would think he has been thou enough all ready) and get 
the Icon and the Flute.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"> Return the flute to Lianna and she should give you the 
Ingot.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"> Buy 2 Enchanted plat Bars and give the Icon, Ingot and 2 Plat bars to 
Gavel for the Bracer of the Reverent.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"> (HINT) All you need to do is Kill Regis he 
has both items you need for the quest. There is a NPC group of werewolf hunters 
just at the foot of the hill where Regis spawns and they end up killing Zahal 
for you most of the time. <B>BE WARNED</B> if you are a Dark Elf Cleric you will 
be <B>KOS</B> to the werewolf hunters. At level 40, 2 of the 4 NPCs coned blue 
to me and they have a HUGE aggro range and they killed my cleric 3 times. I have 
fixed my faction with the Guards and the Venders in NK but it has no effect on 
the hunters and as of writing this I still have not been able to do this quest 
because of them. (Thanks for thinking the quest thou verant) (If you want two 
bracers you have to do this quest twice) Also you can use sense undead spell 
here to see if Zahal or Regis are in the zone it’s the only time I have ever had 
a reason for casting this spell.</li>

you will come to a cave where you can breath once again. In the cave go to LOC

there is a necro in this cave that is RED to level 50s and he WILL kill you, but 
he does not roam so as long as you don't go near him you are fine, what you are 
looking for is a spawn of the Glacial Bear. You can't miss him he's about as big 
as the hallway. He's on an 8-hour spawn cycle his placeholder is a skelly. But 
don't get confused just before the placeholder spawns a roamer skelly spawns 
close to the same area. Kill the Bear and get the Icon of the Devout.&nbsp;</li>

    <p align="left">This is a hidden Cleric quest 
in the Temple of Solusek Ro. When you hail 
Gavel, and ask him about the Icon of Sacrament, he will tell you that the 
icon and ingots of Sacrament is only a legend, and if you can somehow find and 
return them to him, plus 2 magnetized platinum bars, he can make something 
for you.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"> The Icon of Sacrament is to be found in Castle Mistmoore. At the back 
of the tomb in the Graveyard there's a secret wall. Go through that secret wall 
you will enter into a small room with 4 doors. Open the door that you see as you 
enter the room; that will trigger the other doors open as well. Then turn to 
your left, there's 2 rooms. Go into the left hand side room, the icon is on the 
floor, which looks just like a voodoo doll. <B>WARNING</B> Castle Mistmoore zone 
is a dangerous zone. How I got the Icon and managed not get killed was I bought 
some Invisible potions and first thing in morning, ran down to the room, and 
picked it up first try and then ran out of the zone.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">A Darkened Giant Skeleton in Mountain 
Rathe drops the Ingot of Sacrament. (Loc -620, -1600). When you zone in from 
Feerrot, head down the path and take your first left. Go until you see a tower on 
your left keep going and you will see an old Druid Ring on the left hand side 
with many undead spawns. Clean them all up (As I have heard, it spawns on random 
places in this ruin). You will see a Giant Skeleton that is darker in color, 
just like a Darkbone.&nbsp; He is the one you need to kill.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"> After you have both 
Icon and Ingot, you will need to get 2 enchanted platinum bars. Give the 2 
Enchanted Plat bars to Ostrom in Temple of Solusek Ro; he will then magnetized 
them for you.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"> Give the icon, ingot and 2 Magnetized platinum bars to Gavel; he 
will then make you a Caduceus of Sacrament.</li>
