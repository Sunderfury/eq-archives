My personal favorite was this monk the other night.  I'm playing a level 18 dwarf cleric, and this human monk is begging for heals and then swearing at me when I refused.  I wouldn't heal him because he had just lost all those hitpoints killing a beggar for a torch...now what good-alligned healer is going to help out a murderer?!?<p>I use all my spells within my role.  I always heal dwarves, no questions asked.  I heal all others who are not evil if I can, and I will heal any evil race if they have demonstrated that they do not follow the traditional values of their race.<p>--Kelsun<br>Servant of Brell Serillis
