      <p align="left"><b><font size="4">***Things Groups Should Expect From
      Their Cleric***</font></b><br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Buffing<br>
      </b><br>
      The cleric should make sure everyone is buffed for the entire time the
      party is in a potential combat situation.<br>
      <br>
      a. Courage line (includes center, daring, bravery, valor, resolution)<br>
      <br>
      Adds HP/AC about 80/5 at my level, probably our most effective and
      efficient line of buffs. All clerics should keep it on all the party's
      tanks. I keep it on everyone, tanks and casters, since they all appreciate
      the significant boost in hit points this spell gives at all levels.<br>
      <br>
      b. Holy armor line (includes spirit armor, guard(?), armor of faith,
      shield of words)<br>
      <br>
      Adds AC only. In my opinion, this line is too inefficient at my level to
      be &quot;expected&quot;- ~11 AC for 70 mana, ouch. At that cost, it
      essentially doubles buffing downtime, and I've noticed little difference
      in party effectiveness without it, so I generally cast it only when people
      specifically request it except with small groups or when I expect very
      close fights. I believe that the &quot;skin&quot; shaman/ranger/druid
      buffs are a better substitute (but they do not stack with the courage
      line).<br>
      <br>
      c. Endure/resist buffs (magic, fire, cold, disease, poison)<br>
      <br>
      Efficiently adds significant amounts of resistance. Endure magic is
      invaluable, adds 20 magic resistance for very low mana cost. The others
      can be applied cheaply based on expected opposition. If mana is tight and
      there are others who can cast endure buffs (shaman/druid/enchanter) in the
      party, this can be delegated as well. </p>
      <p align="left"><br>
      d. Symbol buffs (symbol of transal, symbol of ryltan, symbol of pinzam
      (sp?), symbol of naltron)<br>
      <br>
      Add HP only and requires a reagent. Because this costs the cleric about
      2-3g per cast, it cannot be fairly &quot;expected&quot;, in my opinion.
      Top-flight tanks often carry the reagent for this line (cat's eye agates,
      at my level) and provide them to the cleric, in which case the cleric
      should always be willing to provide it. Personally, I carry a supply of
      the reagents everywhere and keep it on my puller at all times. I will
      sometimes put it on other party members depending on a variety of factors,
      including class, equipment, and opponent difficulty. For example, I often
      cast it on rogues since their backstab usually earns them inordinate
      amounts of monster love.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Healing</b><br>
      <br>
      From level 14 on, a cleric should be the group's primary healer in most
      circumstances. There are certain grey areas (between levels 19 and 23
      &amp; between 29 and 33) where the shaman and druid &quot;catch up&quot;
      to the cleric in healing ability and could function just as well, but
      their classes both have more offense to offer to the party than the cleric
      (clerics with the level 29 wrath spell may argue this point :-) and may be
      more effective when used to burn, DoT, and/or debuff opponents, with
      healing as a secondary function. When a group has two or more members
      capable of primary healing duty in the party...well, that's a whole
      different post, if anyone's interested. :-)<br>
      <br>
      Being the primary healer means:<br>
      <br>
      a. Spending the vast majority of their mana during combat on healing. Duh.<br>
      <br>
      b. Keeping the group informed of their remaining mana during combat. I
      start calling out percentages from around 40% down to OOM.<br>
      <br>
      c. Keeping all party members above 50% health. Higher-level clerics with
      more powerful healing spells may choose to wait longer, but in general,
      once my tanks are down to 60% health, I'm healing them. If I can't keep
      everyone above this level, I know it's time to re-evaluate the situation
      to determine whether we are in a close, but winnable fight, or whether a
      strategic retreat is called for.<br>
      <br>
      d. Working to minimize monster engagement, since interrupted heal attempts
      can spell death for the party. Expect your cleric to notify you
      immediately when they are under attack and unable to cast. I have learned
      to resist my initial instinct and refrain from entering melee with
      creatures that attack me, since it just makes it that much harder for my
      tanks to get them off of me.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Utility spells<br>
      </b><br>
      In certain circumstances, the group may significantly benefit from the
      cleric's use of utility spells to help the group, including root, fear,
      invis to undead, and our stun line, which is fabulous against casting
      monsters, especially those that heal. Expect your cleric to bring these to
      bear when needed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Offensive spells<br>
      </b><br>
      In most circumstances, the &quot;negative damage&quot; a cleric provides
      with their healing spells is far more efficient and helpful to the group
      than the direct damage they can deal out. Expect your cleric to save these
      spells for very special situations.<br>
      <br>
      <b><font size="4">*** Things Clerics Should Expect From Their Group ***<br>
      </font></b><br>
      <b>1. Time</b><br>
      <br>
      Give your cleric the time they need to help you out. Switching spells in
      and out of memory takes time. Recovering mana after a round of buffing or
      after combat takes time. I part company quickly with any group that won't
      do this for me.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Post-combat healing assistance, when available. </b></p>
      <p align="left">If the group includes backup healers, including hybrid
      classes, have them top off everyone else off after the fight while the
      cleric meditates to reduce downtime.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Protection<br>
      </b><br>
      If your cleric is under attack, give priority to drawing the attackers
      away&nbsp; from them. Your cleric should help you by not doing things to
      make it angrier and by stepping away when you begin to attack their
      assailants. <br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b>4. Love<br>
      </b><br>
      Don't forget to thank your cleric from time to time. The work of healing
      is fulfilling but sometimes tedious, and a little bit of appreciation can
      really recharge a burnt-out cleric's batteries.<br>
      <br>
      <b><font size="4">*** Final Thought ***<br>
      </font></b><br>
      I believe the cleric is at their best when they are the quarterback of the
      party's support team. The best clerics understand the abilities of EVERY
      other class and know which ones to call for given any combination of
      classes in the party's makeup. I'm not there yet, but that's where I want
      to be. And if this sounds like the way YOU want your cleric to behave,
      give me a tell sometime. I'm always up for a new adventure!<br>
