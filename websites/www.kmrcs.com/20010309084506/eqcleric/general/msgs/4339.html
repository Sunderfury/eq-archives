Heh, you could've just asked me if you got exp from a second res, i would've answered.  Instead, you drag me from the lord room to live side just to give you a res for no exp.  You will NOT get exp if you are already ressed.  So, either res yourself, or wait for someone higher lvl to res you.<p>Stump (Krieger)<p>: same thing for ressurection vs ressusicate .. when ressus is cast first... i had a revive cast on myself... and decided to try to expiriment since a 50th lvl cleric was standing close...i got the exp message.. but  didnt see my exp bar move <p>: Vengance N'Hellebourne  servant of hatred to the Great Hatred   39th circle of Hate <p>
