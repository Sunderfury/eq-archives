I am a level 21 High Elf Cleric and need some advice on where to hunt.  I have tried Mistmoore but there are to many trains that keep making me zone to safety and I don't get much exp running for my life.  The only time I really get good exp there is in the middle of the night hehe.  I have been to unrest a few times but is hard to find a group there (go figure.)  I was wondering if some people could give me some advice on where to go.  I have been told Lake Rathetear or South Karana but didn't want to make the big trip if I shouldn't be there.  Any help would be great =) Thanks<p>Ziggi,<br>Healer of Tunare
