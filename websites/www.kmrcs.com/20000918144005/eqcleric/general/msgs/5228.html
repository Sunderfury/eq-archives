I asked Lianna "Where can I find Zahal" (or something like that) and the answer was that the "roams North Karana". So off I went. After 2 hours of constant running around, shouting if anyone had seen this Zahal - I gave up. Even had a druid friend gate there and track him/her/it. <p>Nothing...<p>I am starting to see a big, fat, "N" materialize in front of the "E" in EverQuest....<p>Pirmin<p>PS: Vilyar - You got it backwards. If we kill Zahal the Reverents body will appear at the northern treeline towards the East. (Did that make any sense? 8)<br>
