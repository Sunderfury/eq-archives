I had this same problem. The blessed oil quest already mentioned works, as well as killing Drosco. ALSO, many of the quests in for the Order of Thunder (Paladins) will raise ToL faction - the Order of Thunder amulet, etc.  And the necro that spawns in Q Hills raises faction.<p>As for normal mobs - I didn't find anything in the sewers besides Drosco that worked. And I wasn't quite ready, at 27, to waltz into the Bloodsabre necro guild and start blasting.<br>
