Was fighting rather deep inside SolA when too much was pulled and I died.  Another member of the group bought it also.  Here's the strange part:<p>When the evac went off I thought I made it out (was at a sliver of health).  I got the loading message and all that.  After I finished zoning the game decided I died after all and then I started loading again.  Oh well, it happens (hadn't died in a few weeks).  <p>However, when I zoned back in my corpse was at the zone line.  Great I thought and I looted up.  Not only was my corpse there but so was the other person's.  So I tried to revive, but got a message that the target was too far away.  I had them /consent me and moved the corpse.  Before I could revive again I had to zone.  After zoning back I then revived and it worked normally.<p>Anyone have any ideas?  Maybe this is a response to the duping bug? (No, I won't explain it =) ).<p>Rayne<br>
