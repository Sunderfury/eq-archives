I feel like the mad poster today, as this is my third post heh heh.  Anyway, my suggestion for new board, would perhaps include someway to group messages by server? or be split by server.  Very often you see post with people asking "Are there any other clerics of (whichever race) on (whichever sever)?"  I think it would be helpful.  Also, I've seen something on (I think) eq.castersrealm that I thought was awesome.  It was a database, where you could register your character and provide information about him/her, race, server, etc...  You could then search it for specific race, class, server, etc...  An alternative to breaking down the message board by server?  <p>I'm sure Rayne is probably groaning at the prospect of trying to implement something like that ;) Just my 2 cents.  BTW This board has really helped me and I for one appreciate all the work Rayne has done in maintaining it. Keep up the good work and thanks.
