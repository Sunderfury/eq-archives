: I was looking at the graphic for the Boots of the Reliant on the Alahkazam web site.

: On the list of races, it had Half Elf listed, but not Halfling.

: Since there are no Half Elf clerics, I have a feeling that Verant Typoed yet again. I wouldn't be surprised if Halfings are able to wear the armor after the next patch.

: They did a similar type with the Ranger sword, &quot;The Short Sword of Morin&quot; It was useable by High Elf rangers but not Half Elf rangers. They fixed it in the last patch.
