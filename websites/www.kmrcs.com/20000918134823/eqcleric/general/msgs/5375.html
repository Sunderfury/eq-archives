     Unfortunately, a lot of a cleric's strengths have to be used properly for him to get experience.  Have you ever thought why mob's that have cleric spells (i.e. an orc shaman, treant) are so darned TOUGH?  It's because the computer knows how to use cleric spells properly.  Think about that.<p>      Secondly, anyone who's fighting in Blackburrow either a) Has a plan, or b) is stupid.  Fight with tactics, don't just run in and bash.  That's how you pull trains, and die.<p>      Third, if you haven't raised 200pp by level 14, YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.  Maybe you should find profitable mobs to fight?<p>                      Lowfyrian<br>
