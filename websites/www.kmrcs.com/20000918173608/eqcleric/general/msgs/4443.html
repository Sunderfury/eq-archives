I am really tired of every group I join and which one person dies or anyone you (The Cleric) are blamed for that persons death. They don't note the tons and millions of times you save there lives but notice there misfortune when they die and there's nothing you can do for it. It really doesn't enhance my desire to be this charactor and I certainly don't wanna quit now being lvl 15. I run around during my fights and heal people and need and save tons to lives, but my reward is being screamed at for letting someone down. I have seen Clerics that just fight and ignore people all together, those people should be another class. This is a game and curcumstances will occur when we can't save someone, in that case, you should feel slighty lucky, without the cleric, you would have died much faster and even a more akward location. Please praise them for there help, more than often, they deserve it.<p>Signed MMotann(lvl 15 hi elf cleric)
