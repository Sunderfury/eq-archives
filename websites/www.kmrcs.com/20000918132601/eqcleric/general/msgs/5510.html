It FAILED for me on the test server. I /bugged it and told a GM about it. Don't know if they fixed it. She asks for one Plat bar. May need two.<p>Lusiphur Dragomere<br>Test Server<p><br>: Gull Skytalon finally showed his face on the Aviak Island in Ocean of Tears. I killed all the roaming birds, although I don't know if that helped him spawn or not. He looks just like the others and was a bit harder than them, I would say level 26-28ish. From what I have heard from people who hunt hear (level 20 or so), Gull spawns maybe twice a real time week.<p>: Now, has anyone performed this quest? or any of the others successfully? I am not losing these items to a quest bug! (So don't ask me to go first :)<p>
