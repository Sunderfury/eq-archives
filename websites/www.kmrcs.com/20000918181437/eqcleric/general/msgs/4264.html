I don't have the faction information first hand, so correct me if I'm wrong about this.<p>When you start grouping and going into deep dark places, like the bottom of lower Guk or way into Sol B, it's nice to have an evac (or succor) spell caster with you- most times I wont go that deep without one.  No matter who you are with, when you get jumped 6 or 8 non-experience greens and a couple of blues can kill mutliple members of your party, especially if they are spell casters.  With this in mind, if that evac/succor is a druid you will be teleporting to an area that MAY have 4 or 5 treants around it.  If you just teleported out of a bad situation where multiple party members were getting pounded on, why chance it by screwing around with your faction with them?<p>I never killed one treant, although it was more of a roleplaying decision than a logical thing I was thinking around level 30, but I wouldn't want to chance it.  I also wouldn't want to be excluded from a GM run even that took place in Qeynos or Q Hills (especially if it's a 3 dam 40delay "Divine Mace" that has +20 wisdom, +15 str, +50 mana, process complete heal on self, unlimited charges of Words of Healing **dreaming/joking**).  I've maintained my faction with all the races, except Dark Elves, Trolls, and Ogres (their guards are just too good to pass up) and maybe the gnomes in Aknon (we did kill a lot of gnomes is Sol A).  The first and only time I went into Aknon (spelling? as I said, only been there once) I was killed in 2 seconds flat by a MOB that is friendly with the necros in the gnome city- they HATE followers of Tunare.  After having someone tell me when it was clear and looting my body, I never went back.<p>I have seen people get aggro'd by the treants after a druid succored a party out.  Of course that was a dark elf necro that was 1/2 health.  Never did get to see what level the necro was as he went down pretty quick.<p>Again, I may be wrong about killing them and the faction hits that you take, but not something that I chose to do.

: When you start grouping and going into deep dark places, like the bottom of lower Guk or way into Sol B, it's nice to have an evac (or succor) spell caster with you- most times I wont go that deep without one.  No matter who you are with, when you get jumped 6 or 8 non-experience greens and a couple of blues can kill mutliple members of your party, especially if they are spell casters.

I also wouldn't want to be excluded from a GM run even that took place in Qeynos or Q Hills (especially if it's a 3 dam 40delay &quot;Divine Mace&quot; that has +20 wisdom, +15 str, +50 mana, process complete heal on self, unlimited charges of Words of Healing **dreaming/joking**).
