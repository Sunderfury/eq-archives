If you want to get bored, try developing a Warrior character, just to see what the other side is like. I did this and thought it would be fun at he raised to lvl 15 and got dual wield and double hit abilities. However, I found out very quickly that it was really boring to sit and heal yourself at a warrior as you levels increase and the amount of hp you have does. Cleric heal up 3-5 time faster with med and use of spells. I found I was better able to solo melee with my cleric than an equal level warrior, since I could also cast furor in between hits and heal up much faster so I could kill the next mob. Hope this helps you. You never know how good you have it sometimes til you see the other side. Without clerics, a warrior spends all his time trying to heal slowly.<p>Karaf<br>19th Order Dwarf Cleric
