The Serpentine Bracer is the best Monk Bracer around (I am pretty sure), but it is very easy to get at level 35+ for a group of 6. It is found on the Reanimated Hand in Lower Guk near the Arch Magi (and close(ish) to the Ghoul Lord). When my party was camping the AM/GL area we would pop over and smack the hand ;) hehehe. After a point we got bored killing the hand, we just pulled Hall trash. The Serpentine Bracer is the common drop on the Hand and the Hand always spawns with a spawn time of about 225 mins(ish). I travel with a regular group and we found enough to equip our Monk with two all of our twinks and I still had 3 extra. If you are on Bristlebane I only have one left, if you want more let me know ;). <p>: : How much do staff of writhing's go for at the auctions ;)<p>: On our server, Bristlebane, not much mayyyyybe 350PP.
