I always keep Atone up as well. When used in conjunction with Root it has saved my wife and I many troubles. For example we were fighting hill giants in Rathe Mountain and as she was pulling a hill giant appeared right in front of her. We had two hill giants. I rooted one and then she ran the other a good distance away. Once she and I were both out of the aggro of the rooted hill giant I cast Atone on it. Now we are down to fighting one hill giant thanks to the power of forgiveness.<p>It does have one other fun side effect which is the message any of your fellow travellers in Norrath will get if you cast it on them. It basically says something about them feeling forgiveness...and is always fun to cast on party members when everyone is sitting around getting bored. :)
