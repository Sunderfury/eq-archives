On most servers, just use /ignore then start telling everyone else in the zone what a jerk he's being.  Works really well when you start telling his guild about it.  I got one guy kicked out of 4 guilds over a two month period by sending them screenshots of this guys remarks to me.  He started to follow me around and train stuff on us- so he was finally banned.<p>I refuse to stand by while some jerk tries to tell me that I am here to make HIS/HER game more enjoyable or to help them get back experience from their OWN F***ING mistakes.  People like that just piss me off.<p>I'm here to enjoy the game and I have the right to play it the way I want to.  I'm NOT there for anyone else but me.  I do love to help others and always do, but I do it as a kind act.  I pay the $10/month, just like others do.
