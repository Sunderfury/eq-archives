As I posted on the other site...<p>I prefer a threaded message style, but the new board system is just fine.  We would all get used to it quite quickly.<p>We need to get rid of the idiots who are posting here.  It must be a pain and frustration to have your hard work, made freely available to all, abused the way it has been.
