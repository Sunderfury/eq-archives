...can match a cleric's healing abilities for some levels, when playing as my ranger, I'd rather have an unknown cleric than an unknown druid or shaman anyday.  The reason is that cleric's, for obvious reasons, are more inclined to accept that their primary responsiblity is healing, but you never can tell with a druid or shaman.  Some people just don't gain a lot of satisfaction from healing, but would rather help the group by killing the monster.  There's nothing wrong with this, it's just that clerics are more likely to enjoy being healers, hence do a better job at it.  And my ranger feels safer with a good healer than a good blaster anyday.<p>And clerics do get better healing spells at earlier levels, like at level 14 we get a heal spell that druids don't get until 19 (not sure about shamans), so groups are better off with a cleric during these levels even if the druid or shaman has a healer's heart.  Unfortunately, at levels 14 - 19, most people don't know this, unless it's their second character.  But the fact remains that a group with a good cleric will survive tougher odds and can handle tougher mobs, thereby getting better exp and loot than one without.<p>To the originator of this thread - my cleric is at a level (21) where druids and shamans of the same level can heal just as well as I can, nevertheless I never have a problem finding a group.  In fact, being an introvert, I like being by myself sometimes, so I end up grouped more often than I would like (OK, so I have a problem saying "No" ;))  So I'm wondering if you might be doing something wrong.  It could just be a matter of location - in the outdoor zones, people seem to prefer to solo or be in small groups.  If that's the case, try moving to a dungeon where large groups are necessary and where pulling a reasonable number of mobs is less predictable.  At level 18, I'd suggest Perma, although Befallen, Unrest, Najena, or Guk may do just as well.  In Perma, at level 18, you should be able to solo the mobs close to the zone.  If not, at the zone, safety is nearby and it won't take long for someone to zone in, also looking for a group. I also got a big kick out of helping out with trains, trying to heal the runners before they got to the zone (another good reason to warn about trains, since I'm sure I'm not the only one who likes to do this ;)) As I said, I often found myself grouped faster than I liked and after a few days there, made several new friends who made it a point to seek me out.  Hmmm, it just occurred to me that I left Perma a few days ago for a change in scenery (Lake Rathe/Rathe Mtns/SK area) and about 6 of the folks I grouped with in Perma have wandered down there.  Hmmm, it's got to be a coincidence, but I wonder...<p>The morale of this story is, after spending some time in a place, and you don't find yourself grouping with the same folks or therewise getting "repeat business" it might be time to evaluate your playing tactics.  This message board is a great place for learning how to effectively play a cleric and has taught me a lot, so don't hesitate to ask someone!<br>
