While I have only seen picture & descriptions of a couple of the POF armor pieces it doesn't sound like it's worth getting to me - The one that comes to mind is this:Ethereal Mist Boots:  AC 15. +5Int, +7 Sv cold,  +5 Agi.  Wt 4.  No drop.  Clerics only.  Found in the Plane of Fear. <p>Sure it's nice AC and stuff but +5 int?  Why +int?  That's seem pretty stupid for a cleric to have.  Surely there are other boots out there that are good ac that have better benefits - like the golden efreeti boots +9wis +9int sounds a whole lot better - don't know which classes - but it's all races so I'm assuming that most races will be able to wear.<p><p>: Why in the name of (fill in your deity here) were Halflings, Gnomes, and Dark Elf clerics exempt from being able to wear the Plane of Fear Armor?  I realize there are not a lot of us out there compared to you Dwarves and High Elves, but explain to me the reasoning for us being shafted on the best Cleric armor in the game??????   If I would have know this when I created my character, I might have chosen a different race.  Why is it Verant never has the balls to give a popular race/class the shaft?  If certain races are to be exempt, at least give me a decent story-line or justification for this.  Jesus.  What a bunch of BS!!!!!!<p>
