<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We, the clerics of Norrath, have watched quietly as changes
have been made throughout the land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Some have been popular, while others have not.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We recognize and acknowledge the time, effort and trials that
must be undertaken to achieve the goals of balance, playability and endurance
of the game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We love the diversity of the classes of Norrath and respect
the uniqueness of each.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Every class has
certain defining characteristics that to need to remain proprietary in order to
retain the value and integration of all classes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We also respect the need to have characters struggle for
advancement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Players cannot expect to
be out slaying dragons after one day of game play.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this document, we offer our suggestions and comments on
the cleric class, both as a whole and at certain levels of advancement.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While we enjoy playing clerics, we believe
that there are a few areas that should be adjusted to improve the playability
and viability of the class without either overpowering us or lessening the
defining characteristics and role of other classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The very gods themselves have defined clerics by the
following 6 characteristics:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Norrath.</u></b><u> </u><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No other class
should be able to match our ability to heal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>Restorers of Life.</u></b><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>None but one so closely in touch with their
god as the cleric should be able to restore life to the extent that we are
capable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>Masters of
Destroying the Undead.</u></b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No other
class should surpass the ability of a cleric to expunge these underworld
denizens with the force and speed of a cleric carrying their god’s disapproval
of the undead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>Superior Protection.</u></b><span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Clerics have been given the ability to cloak
ourselves with the highest protection in the land, platemail armor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Clerics draw the attention of the mobs when healing
others, and should possess the ability to adorn the best protection available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>Less Effective
Fighters.</u></b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Clerics are incapable
of doing the damage at melee as the pure fighters and other hybrid
classes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Clerics are healers, and
should not be warriors at melee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'><![if !supportLists]>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>Less Effective at
Destroying the Living.</u></b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Clerics
are not capable of dealing damage to the living through our spells to the
extent of the pure and hybrid caster classes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Again, clerics are healers, not primary damage spell casters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having taken all of these defining characteristics of the
cleric into consideration, we would like to propose a set of changes we feel
will add to the playability, enjoyment and viability of our class without
upsetting game balance or adversely impacting the other classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Item #1:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Stun While Invulnerable</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has been the source of much consternation and
discussion in the cleric community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If,
while invulnerable, we are allegedly immune to being hurt or damaged in any
way, how is it possible that we can be stunned?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Our line of invulnerability spells are highly useful, but
invariably when the situation calls for their use, the creature(s) in question
are more than capable of stunning us repeatedly and having us remain under
their feet when our divine protection wears off.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We believe if the gods have gifted us with the ability to render
ourselves invulnerable, then no type of harm should be able to penetrate that
barrier, which includes protection against stunning blows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Item #2:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Healing Spells</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Casting times for clerics’ higher level healing spells need
to be reduced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In a difficult battle,
party members are taking damage at a much faster rate than the cleric can keep
them healed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We may have the mana to
heal, however, it takes entirely too long to cast the G<i>reater</i>, <i>Superior</i>,
and C<i>omplete</i> heals for us to be effective.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Reducing the casting time would not increase our healing power,
e.g., the same amount of hps restored would remain unchanged, but would enhance
our ability to sustain life among our party members.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We are, after all, the clerics, defined by the very gods
themselves as the masters of healing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We truly need to be able to do this in a much more efficient manner at
the higher levels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Item #3:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Resurrection</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the reductions in the death penalty, we now have less
value as a class in this respect, and believe the balance needs to be restored
in some way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Restructuring the amount
of experience restoration values for this line of our spells we feel would accomplish
this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The current first in the line, <i>Revive</i>,
does nothing more than “summon” the person to their corpse, restoring no
experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second line,
Resuscitate, restores very little of the lost exp.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>And Resurrect, which is attained only at the current end of a
cleric’s career and is the ultimate in this line, does not restore the amount
of experience it should.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We believe
each line should be changed to restore some experience at the first level with
Revive, and enhance the restoration value for the remaining two.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This would restore the original value of our
ability to raise the dead, which is still not unique to our class with paladins
sharing our Revive spell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Item #4:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cleric Quests </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More so than perhaps other classes, paladins and clerics
need religious/guild-centric quests to follow from their home temple.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Clerical quests should exist in all temples
throughout the lands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These quests
should also be capable of accomplishment without alienating a significant
faction of the city guards or another city/race that renders you killed on
sight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Additionally, these quests
should be designed for different levels and the specific temple/god from which
they are received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As an example, a
quest item of a Robe of Mithaniel Marr could exist with the stats increasing
each quest level up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We also feel the
rewards of a quest should be more commensurate with the difficulties involved
in completion. Too many existing quests take either a full party of higher
levels to complete or they result in a prize/reward vastly out of proportion to
the time, effort and level required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u>Item #5:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cleric Specific Items</u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There appears to be fewer cleric-only items in the lands
than exist for other classes, with the recent exception of the Plane of Fear,
which is achievable only by those clerics of high level.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And even on the Fear Plane, it appears that
the spawn rate of the denizen carrying the cleric-only armor as well as the
frequency, with which it actually carries one of these items, is less than
those of other classes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There should be
cleric-only items achievable by all levels that exist in the same amount as
those for other classes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These would
include religious-type items unique to our class such as the Robe of Mithaniel
Marr mentioned previously, and could be specific also to a servant of that
particular god.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We believe that items
of this nature would help clerics establish an identity and greatly improve the
enjoyment of our play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Item #6:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Combat Against the Undead</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clerics should be capable of damaging the undead through
their spells at least as well as other casting classes of equal level.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Slaying the undead is our charge.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We cannot compete for damaging undead the
living and we cannot control the undead as pets, but putting the undead back
into their grave is and should clearly be the cleric’s job.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our spells against the undead should cast as
quickly, be as mana efficient, and deal as much damage as other casters’ spells
of equal level, but the fact is that they are not. We strongly agree that an
enhancement to our direct damage line of spells against the undead is needed
with respect to these three items of casting time, mana required and damage
done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Item #7:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Combat Against Undead –
Area Effects</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As part of our defining characteristics as masters at
dispatching the undead, we believe when faced with a mob of undead that we
should have the ability to cast an area effect spell specifically for these
creatures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In keeping with our normal
and area effect direct damage spells being much less effective against the
living, we should have an area effect spell against the undead that is much
more powerful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Item #8:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Meditation </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This request is made to benefit all casting classes.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We feel that meditation should be programmed
as any other skill, such as melee or fishing or begging, with the ability to
“hot key” and go directly to our spell book with meditation active, rather than
having to go through a two-step process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Item #9: Direct Damage Spells Against the Living</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clerics recently had their highest-level direct damage
spell, Retribution, reduced in effect by 10% without what we feel is any
acceptable or justifiable explanation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Retribution is not achieved until level 44, and from that level up, the
damage done by Retribution to those creatures we must fight for experience is
not particularly great, even when it hits for full damage.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Its effectiveness against such creatures is
also greatly reduced by the excessive length of time it takes for this spell to
cast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Additionally, there are no other
direct damage spells for us between Wrath and Retribution, with Wrath becoming
basically useless for the last 5 or 6 levels before a cleric can acquire
Retribution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We do not wish to be
“nukers,” but feel that upon attaining the last six highest levels of our
current career, we should be capable of assisting our party in offense through
our spells by doing some decent damage, since we are incapable of doing any
meaningful damage at melee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even
non-pure caster classes are capable of doing a significantly greater amount of
damage with their spells than we are, and at much lower levels.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>From any class perspective, being able to do
one thing only becomes extremely boring, and decreases enjoyment and desire to
continue playing that class.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If all, we
as clerics, are capable of doing is healing and meditating, it gets old
quickly, especially when reaching the higher levels.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We would propose either adding an intermediate direct damage
spell between Wrath and Retribution, or adding a higher direct damage spell at
level 49, and restore the original damage done by Retribution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h1>Item #10:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Hammer Line of Summon
Spells</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Hammer series of summon spells that the gods have given
to clerics is generally deemed useless by our class after level 12.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Stats for these weapons should be increased
at higher levels to make them more viable and useful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<h1>Item #11:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Bandages</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We raise this issue with full awareness of previous
statements regarding the summoning of bandages by other classes in their
requests to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We do feel, however,
that our inability to summon bandages, even if only useable by us is not in
keeping with our role as primary healers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We would like the ability to summon bandages, even if they are useable
only by the summoner, in order to further our role as primary healers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><u><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We wish to thank you for taking the time to read through our
requests.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We understand you must
receive hundreds of e-mails per week with suggestions, comments and/or
complaints.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We hope that ours has been
received in the spirit in which it was intended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We clerics derive a great deal of enjoyment from
EverQuest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We are a different lot than
most, prone to focusing on helping others and getting along rather than
shouting, complaining and making threats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We do feel, however, that it time for us, as a class, to make a
statement about our role and viability as the primary healers of Norrath, and
to see some positive enhancements made to our class as others have seen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We thank you for creating this wonderful world for all of us
to enjoy, and thank you for your time and consideration of our suggestions and
requests.</p>
