It worked fine for me, I gave the stuff to him in this order in the give window:<p>Ingot of Reliant - Slot 1<br>Icon of Reliant - Slot 2<br>(1) Enchanted Plat Bar - Slot 3<br>(1) Enchanted Plat Bar - Slot 4<p>His reponse was kinda weird, but I got the boots anyways:<p>Good work!  Do you have the rest?<br>Good work!  Do you have the rest?<br>Here is your reward!  Wear it well (or something like that)<br>Good work!  Do you have the rest?<p>There 4th line made me wonder if I REALLY had to give him 2 bar or not, but hell, I'm not gonna take any chances.  I got the boots and I wear them proudly.<p>: Now I give the diary to the guy for the icon right, then give both and the plat to the guy in Sol Temple, but I did the penitent quest and it did not work, has anyone tried this one so I know it works, I am afraid to lose everything again, do I have to stack the plat bars?  Because Penitent didn't work when the bars were NOT stacked<p>: thanx in advance<p>
