: : Well I had a.....discussion on guildchat last night about this subject, so I thought I would post my ideas and see what all of the other clerics out there think.

: : A member of my noble guild mentioned how he hated ‘bad clerics’ because a cleric is the clothespin that keeps a group attached to string of life. I responded with “Well I don’t mind bad clerics, because I make it a point to steer clear of them. What bothers me are one-sided clerics who use a single strategy all of the time.” Then a cleric in my guild said that he only heals all of the time and asked whether or not I had a problem with that. Needless to say, this discussion continued. Unfortunately, we were not able to arrive at a consensus.

: Versatility only comes into play in smaller groups.  In a large group at higher levels, your role becomes much more specialized because you can be certain that the other classes do their jobs better than you can.  If you are the best tank in your group or the best nuker, it sounds like your group is missing a component.  Your &quot;versatility&quot; should only come into play in situations like dealing with casters, where the immediacy of your extra, though not as efficient, punch can save party members hundreds of hp in damage.
