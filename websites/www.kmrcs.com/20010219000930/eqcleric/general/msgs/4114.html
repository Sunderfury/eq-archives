After playing my DE cleric to his 29th season I must say I wholeheartedly agree with you on this...the DE cleric seems to have been forgotten about questwise.  Now the Butcherblock hammer comes out, gnome and dwarf only...isn't that lovely.  So instead of giving the DE cleric's someway of questing for a decent weapon, the developers created yet another(bullsmasher being the first) weapon just for the small clerical races. Irregardless of this, I bought a screaming mace..and since our melee is pretty much a joke anyways at 25+ seasons I am content with it.  You have to feel for the DE Clerics that are on the PvP server though, they have access to no clerical weapons as they are all "good" race quests...gee that doesn't make much sense now does it?  I guess they just buy Combine maces or something...nothing else to do.  Alas, after playing for several months I have seen that only the cries of many are heard in the land of Norrath..and since there are so few of us Clerics of Innoruuk I doubt our lack of a decent quested weapon will ever be remedied.  So enjoy saving up your hard earned loot so you can buy a screaming mace or <shudders> shining star of light..is it just me or does it seem inherently wrong that a DE can even wield a shining star of light...never mind...back in my evil cage..nothing to see here, move along please.....
