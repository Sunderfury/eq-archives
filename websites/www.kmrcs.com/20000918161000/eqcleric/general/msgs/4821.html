You right at lower lvls a shaman can heal as good but nuke better and cast SoW and cool buffs.<p>At sub 20 shaman buffs suck though since AGI matters very little etc...until later.  Cleric buffs are better until then.  And if you are refering to the shaman quickness line...the enchanter has that too. An enchanter can buff the monks STR and a ranger could buff the monks AGI.  But nowhere near that of a shaman.  However the shaman's mana is limited.<p>And a warriors taunt is nice.  But the dmg isn't so much better that the reduced down time by having a paladin to heal etc should be over looked.  Especially since they can stun at 30 and if in an undead area thier dmg surpases a warrior easily...even more with a ghoulsbane =)<p>But your group is very good for a late 20's expedition on live stuff (most stuff is live).  At higher lvls though a clerics healing is much more noticible.  And shamans sometimes forget to same mana for the heals....or taunt a mob on themselves with thier DD.  They just don't have primary healer down very well.  They didn't pick shaman to be a primary healer.
