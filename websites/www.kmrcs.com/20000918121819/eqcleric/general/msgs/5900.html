I have spent a total of 17 hrs in dagnar's.... I'm not fond of wasting my time with evercamping, but sometimes you just have to do it.  It all started yesterday when i stayed home from work because i was sick, i thought it would be great to ceatch-up on my armor quests.  Boy was i wrong,  my character is in Erollise Marr server and His name is Brunar Bonebane a level 25 cleic, bilge you of course know, is who i need to kill for the ingot.  If anyone here has already gotten the tunic or has another character who can help me kill Bilge i would be verry greatfull, as a thanks all i would ask for is the ingot, not the reed belt or the staff.  Thank you for your time.
