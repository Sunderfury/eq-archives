The life of a cleric can be boring, yes..  But we are much like warriors, in high lvls a group without a cleric is toast.   On test, there are hardly ever more then 3 groups in a givin zone..  With a group of 1 warrior, 1 ranger, 1 shaman, wis, and me (cleric)  we can pretty much clear allmost all of Lower Guk.   Thats only 6 people in the zone.   Now, granted, it gets boring doing nothing but healing and medding..  but its needed..  Think warriors get that much more pleasure doing mid dmg while taking a crap load of damage?  (Warrior:  at 45 + with skills max'd, their dmg is sooo random the best use they have is being a Meat shield.. )  <p>So, its not allways fun, but like a warrior, its needed..
