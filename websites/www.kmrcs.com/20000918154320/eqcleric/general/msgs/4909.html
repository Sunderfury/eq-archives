Actually, reports from the test server are that they are adding stat bonuses to crafted armor (the bracers are +5 str).  Note, as to the cleric armor as far as I know only the boots and gloves have been posted anywhere so far as I know(could be wrong).  From my experience researching armor the boots and gloves always add to what seem to be worthless stats for that class (i.e. PoF armor for any class). For instance Lustrous Russet (indicolite now) boots add +5 int +5 wiz +5 agi +15 dis and +15 poison.  Now the agi is nice but hey wiz and int for a war "(in a mock whining voice) oh come on why do I need int and wiz boots"  Personally I will take the armor and be satisfied.  But hey, I am just a dumb warrior so what do I know.<p>
