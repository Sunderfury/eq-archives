If all clerics were capable of was healing, I'd agree with your post.  But you sell the class short in your post...  If you are on Tunare please give me a tell sometime and I'll show you just what a cleric is capable of...<p>Couple nights ago, 4 tanks, bard, cleric... all 28 to 30.  At 4 corners in cazic... just wanting experience (no rubi).  We did the 4 corners, then pulled from the maze.  In an hour, I don't think I cast more than 5 greater heals.  Tanks fought, I occasionally lulled one in the corner and stunned spellcasters, else just meleed too... bard chained and healed.  Oh, and I pulled too, as the cleric.. so the tanks could sit and heal with bard's heal song while I got next victim.  The tanks couldn't believe that this would work... took a full round of the corners before they believed it.  We had next to no downtime, we were always fighting... and we all had a blast!<p>The point is, clerics that limit themselves to the heal/med routine are missing out... and if you assume your cleric is good for nothing else than you're not using all the resources your group has to offer.  Too bad, dogboy -- you and your cleric could both have a lot more fun, heh...<p>Erondil<br>Level 30 Cleric of Tunare (almost through the first hell level!)<p>p.s.  Clerics make great pullers for things that backstab... like goblins in sol a.  I always end up pulling there -- since stun gives you a few seconds to get out of backstab range :)  And if they do hit you, you have plenty of time to recover while the tanks get hit...
