OH YEA! Stun is awesome. Last night in Lower guk I cant remember how many ghoul urd and tal and other types of wizard froggys we fought, but needless to say I kept stunning over and over and over. Sometimes they resisted so you shrug your shoulders and keep trying to stun them. One stun for whatever mana is WORTH the cost of healing the wizards blasts. I usualy have Force and Stun when im down there. Nothing better than interrupting them froggy wizards nukes.<p>Silis<br>L37 Cleric   Cazic<p><br>:   Despite what some other high level clerics will tell you, your job isn't ONLY to buff/med/heal all the time.
