Penitent is broken entirely or she wants 3 bars and only asks for 2. <p>What I'd recommend is that you have a GM watch you do the quest. Make them promise you that if the quest fails they will give you the items back so that you can complete it when it's working. If they can't do this then either say screw it or try it and post it here. Course after that whole Penitent fiasco, that I'm sure many of us went through, I don't really expect you to play lab rat for Verant's botchy quests. But I expect this quest to work since the item has been obtained by others. Good luck.<p>
