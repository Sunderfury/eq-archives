Basically right now most of us are in Lguk which you are not ready for HOWEVER we need clerics in there is a possibility you would be power-lvl'd to a suitible level for Lguk quickly =)<p>Of course unless your friends are clerics(as primaries)...they will not be power lvl'd. (not even my cleric was power lvl'd...it is secondary...and neither was my enc).  So there is a chance you will leave your friends in your dust.  But you can power lvl them when we are done lvl'ing you.<p>Basically right now we are in the middle of a house keeping phase.  Our very first one.  We found oursleves to have strayed from our goals a bit....and one was to have clerics.  It's sad but we are SOO low on clerics it isn't funny.  When we looked for our main problems that was one of the 2 major items. We have TONS of paladins tho =)
