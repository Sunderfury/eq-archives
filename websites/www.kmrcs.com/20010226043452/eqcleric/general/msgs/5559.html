: Although the spawn times might be long and the items may be hard to find, the recent additions to the game are just that - additions.  The game is now richer.  There are more quests, more mobs that carry desirable items and more equipment.  I do not understand why people are complaining so much and even quitting in some cases over the recent additions.  I feel the game has been tremendously enhanced.  More options, another zone, more quests, but SAME number of people.  Other items will now be easier to get.<p>: Just a few thoughts.<p>: Certainly I understand disappointment over truly broken quests, i.e. PC spends time assembling the required items, presents them and the NPC does not produce the desired item.  That is really bad.<p>
