The EQ_Cleric mailing list has started putting together a FAQ/Guide.  Of course, I will host it once it is completed (after all, I get my best stuff from that list =P).<p>I am certainly not interested in <i>competing</i> with other people who are putting one together, but thought that they might appreciate knowing about the other effort.  Furthermore, I expect to post draft versions on this site so some of the outstanding clerics who post here will have an opportunity to add to it.  I will coordinate adding there suggestions to the master guide.<p>FYI<br>Rayne
