I don't really think that Enchanters are GZ's "pet" class, but I do think there is a reason WHY they are getting a lot of upgrades and cool stuff (especially the ONLY trade skill worth it up until now- and even the upgrades to tailoring and smithing will need an enchanter to make magic items).<p>The main reason that they are getting this treatment (my opinion only), it very similar to what Brad McQuaid did very early in the production phase of the game when he made several appearances and announced across the server that "clerics where vital to the world" to encourage more people to play the class.  Enchanters are a very important class to have, yet there are very few higher level enchanters out there.  Most of the ones I know took up the profession to do jewelcrafting.  Most of these are secondary characters (although I do know one that dropped their mid-20 ranger to become an enchanter full time), so they don't get up to higher levels.  I see maybe 1 enchanter for every 4 or 5 clerics and 1 enchanter for every 10 wizzies.  I'd rather have an enchanter in the party than a wizard- sorry Koveras, Ninielf, and Zollie :)  Two clerics, one enchanter, 2 tanks make a great party (pick a class to fill in that last spot or go without).<p>As most of us past level 29 know from grouping with an enchanter, they are a very powerful addition to a group.  Second to a cleric IMO.  I'll go places with an enchanter that I wouldn't go without one (unless we have a druid or wiz for evac).  But like the cleric, and enchanter helps you STAY in the place you are to get loot and experience.  A wiz or druid does not have that kind of power with their nukes or the evac.  <p>The use of Tashan, their debuffs, buffs (speed buffs that act like a Flowing Black Silk Sash for the melee classes, Insite adds 10-15 points of wisdom for caster classes, the intelligence spell that adds 10-15 points of intelligence to casters that use it, strenght buffs, etc) and damage shields make life so much easier.  Even in a party with just one tank (helps to have a couple pets to do this one right- or the enchater can Charm), they make a HUGE difference.<p>This is the only other class that I think I could play.  Believe me, I've tried the other classes and just can't stick with em.  See my post below on the list for the characters I've played. I did scrap the level 4 human enchanter for a High Elf, as I just couldnt give up the good looks and superior attributes :)  Maybe I won't stick with the enchanter, but they are the only other class I think that groups rely on to save their fannies when the proverbial S**T hits the fan.
