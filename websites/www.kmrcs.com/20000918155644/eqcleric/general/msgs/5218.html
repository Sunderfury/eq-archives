I am 35 High-elf Cleric and always with my wife 31 Halfing warrior.<br>I would like to group caster in order is:<p>1. ENC, thier Clarity, root, DD, mem, speed spell could totally alter the combat.  You could handle 3 times more than normally can.<p>2. Wizard, Thier DD spell and Exec save us lot of life.  Clever wizard will not pull much on self.<p>3. Druid, I like druid too, since I need 2nd healer and emergency Teleporter, also sow and good DD spell.<p>4. Bard, Could tank better than any caster.  Thier song always have additional effect.  Also, thier Healing after war could save me a lot of mana.  Thier Medit song on lvl 34 could additional speed up my Medit (it can stack on ENC's Clarity).<p>5. NEC / Magician, Thier pet is great and strong DD spell.<p>6. Shaman, 2nd Healer, 2nd DD caster, SOW caster and many buffer!!
