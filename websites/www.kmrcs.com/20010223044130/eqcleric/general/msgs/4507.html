I say tishan's triangle for auction once.  I asked the guy what it did.  He said it granted 100hp, 100mana, 100int and 50str or something.  He swore up and down his friend had one. Of course this is a bit hard to beleive.  He said he had to turn in 300+ different items to get it. Hmm..yeah and the world will keep indepth track of how many and which of the 300 items you turned in? Do you know how hard it would be to fashion that quest?  This guy should have made the item stats and quest more beleivable. The name was OK.<p>EQ is full of people who get kicks out of tricking people.  Your guy is just cleverly trying to get you to beleive a lie most likely.  Like the many fictional item pics on the net.  It takes time , effort, and a bit of intelligence to pull off these hoaxes well.<p>The item may exist.  But probably doesn't. Don't get your hopes up too high.
