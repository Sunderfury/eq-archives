            <p><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">*Beginning Note: This guide is
            written from a Cleric’s Point of view. I did not fight in Solusek
            A to level, so I will not address how to pull and fight to gain
            experience. I will focus on some locations and rare spawns.&nbsp; I
            would like to thank Nicole and Joshua for information they posted to
            the Cleric’s Mailing List (Onelist) that helped with this guide.*</span></i></p>
            <p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Ed. Note: Just after
            receiving this guide an excellent map to Solusek A was released by
            the Everlore web site, it can be reached<a href="http://165.90.193.58/images/soluseka.jpg" style="color: #0000FF">
            here</a>.</span></i></b><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></i></p>
            <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Getting there</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">:
            Solusek’s Eye, or Solusek A can be found off of the Lavastorm
            Mountains. After zoning into Lavastorm, head north until you reach a
            large volcano with a Goblin Camp perched on the upper rim. Below
            this camp, down the slope and toward the lava, you will find 2 zone
            entrances. The one on the left leads to Nagafen’s Lair (Solusek
            B), the one on the right is our destination, SolA.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">*One interesting thing to note
            at this point is that these Goblins are not aggro to Dwarves unless
            you have done something to lose faction with them. It is very
            possible to walk through this entire dungeon as a Dwarf and not be
            attacked by anything except a few of the rare spawns. Once you kill
            the Goblins for a short time, you will become KOS.*<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></i></p>
            <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Entrance: </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Immediately
            after zoning into SolA and taking a few steps you will be presented
            with the aspect of this zone that scares people the most…lava. And
            indeed, this may be the worst lava spot in the entire zone. You will
            find a short flight of curved stairs that traverses the room. On
            either side of this walkway, you will find a long drop into some
            nasty lava. In most lava areas in this zone, you can easily jump
            back out onto cool dungeon stone. However, in this spot the only way
            I know to survive is to have levitate or swim through an under-lava
            zone point into a very rough area of Solusek B. Basically, do not
            fall here. There will usually be a few 20ish Goblins near or on this
            stair – don’t let them spook you. Kill them on the flat ground
            near the zone or on the far side of the stair.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Across this stair/walkway you will
            see a wall with a large crack or hole in it - climb through. You
            will encounter low to mid 20s Goblins in this entire area so stay
            alert. Take an immediate right and you will come to a ledge (still
            more Gobs). Straight in front of you and down a small drop-off you
            will see a large metal door. Directly to your right is a tunnel that
            will drop off into a circular room with another tunnel leading out
            of it. This is hall is a zone point to a relatively safe spot in
            SolB (though there is a semi-frequent Greater Kobold that will spawn
            on the other side). Back to the large metal door…<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Goblin Stronghold</span></b><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">:
            </span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Inside of that door is one
            of the main areas of what I refer to as the Goblin Stronghold.
            Within a short distance of this door you will find the Barroom (<b>Bartender
            Spawn</b>) and a <b>Goblin Vendor</b> whom you can buy and sell with
            if you have the faction (Dwarves and people with sneak or invis I
            believe). This section is quite large and the passages wind and
            interconnect like mad; getting turned around and running in circles
            is quite common. I won’t try and give exact directions in this
            area and hopefully you will find the map that accompanies this
            helpful. Inside of the Stronghold the Goblins begin to reach higher
            levels and in some spots will be 30ish (at the end of this document
            you will find a list of Goblin types from lowest to highest level).
            In this area you will find MOBs like the <b>Bartender</b>, <b>Goblin
            Drunkard</b>, <b>Goblin High Shaman</b> and <b>Goblin King</b>.
            There all also passages that will take you to other spawn spots such
            as the <b>Kobold Predator</b> and the <b>Goblin Foreman</b> (these 2
            will be referenced again). Please see another appendix at the end of
            this guide that will list what these MOBs drop as loot.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Let us move back to the ledge
            again, facing the doorway to the Goblin Stronghold. If you turn left
            on this ledge you will see some Goblins (2 or 3) standing in front
            of some hallways that branch off from the path you are on. You will
            need to fight, sneak, or – if you’re a lucky dwarf – walk by
            them and take the first right that you are able to (this excludes
            the secret wall on the right that leads into the Goblin Stronghold).
            You should now begin to see Gnomes. The hall you are in will
            dead-end into a small alcove with a doorway that leads to an
            L-shaped bridge spanning some lava- cross this. Continue on, past
            the swinging pendulum (it will not hurt you, it is just for
            &quot;looks&quot;) and you will come to a larger room with a lava
            lake. Point yourself to the left side of the room and you will see
            the Castle of the Solusek Mining Company (all hands on deck! Gnomes
            ahead!)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The Solusek Mining Company</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">:
            To get over to the castle, you must jump into (almost over) and swim
            a very small section of lava. Do yourself a favor and pick the
            smallest width and take a leap over to the rock ground in front of
            the castle. You should not even take the typical 40 points of lava
            damage if you do this correctly. There is no real danger in this.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">**NOTE: If you are of an evil
            race or have bad faction with Gnomes in general, you will most
            likely have been attacked before you get this far. If you are KOS
            here but have somehow managed to sneak into this area, I do not
            suggest continuing on. There are Gnomes and Clocks every few steps
            in the castle and many of them are in the high 20s and low 30s.
            Killing Kobolds in Solusek B will raise your faction with this group
            of Gnomes (Solusek Mining Co faction).**<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></i></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">There are two drawbridges here.
            The one on the left leads to various Gnomes and Gnome Clockworks,
            and a secret wall that eventually will lead to the Goblin Foreman
            and Kobold Predator (there is an easier way to get to them), but
            nothing particularly noteworthy. Nothing that I have found anyway.
            The bridge on the right is where we are headed…click on it and
            cross.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Once inside, follow the hall until
            you come to a 7-turn. Directly after this, on the left, you will see
            a set of steps going down. Go down the steps and push the button on
            the wall to open the door on your right. Go through the next 2 doors
            and turn to the left. Standing here you will see a door in front of
            you and a door to the right. The door on the right leads to a small
            room with a Gnomish Vendor. He sells the Bag of the Tinkerers. It
            sells for around 6,000pp. Buy it if you like. He is very helpful to
            those fighting in SolB who need to unload items without running to
            the gypsies in Lavastorm. He does not sell food or drink.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">**NOTE: when fighting the
            Gnomes and Clockworks mentioned below – if your faction is not
            above indifferent, other MOBs in the area will attack you as well.
            If you are amiable or above, they will not bother you though they
            may heal the MOB you are killing. Healers are not common here. Also,
            when killing these MOBs you will lose faction with the Mining Co and
            some groups in Ak’anon. Unless you are &quot;farming&quot; items
            you should not go KOS anywhere – that is, if you were not close to
            KOS to begin with (but then you would be getting gang-banged here
            when attacking). Killing Kobolds in SolB will raise your Solusek
            Mining Company faction, but not the Ak’anon faction.**<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></i></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The door in front of you houses
            the spawn point of <b>Gabbie Mardoddle</b>. Gabbie’s rare drop is
            one of the most sought-after items in the game, the Molten Cloak
            (4AC +4 WIS and INT). Gabbie spawns behind the desk in the small
            room. Gabbie is in the low or mid 30s and a caster. She can do a lot
            of damage in a small amount of time and if you do not kill her
            quickly, she will kill you. I have seen level 45+ tanks have trouble
            with her if she gets a few spells off. A level 50 Cleric (or a 44+)
            can enstill, stun and nuke her to death in about 20 seconds –
            rarely do I lose more than a bubble of health. I strongly suggest
            having a magic resistance buff on you. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Her spot pops about every 20
            minutes, but it is very well known for skipping a spawn or two and
            not popping for 40 minutes to an hour (or more, ugh). Like most rare
            spawns, other MOBs will spawn in her spot (clockworks) and you will
            need to clear them. These clockworks are no pushovers and can hit
            hard. I am guessing they are in the low 30s.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Gabbie’s common drop is the
            Mithril Quill, a 4 damage 19 delay piercing weapon – pretty much
            worthless. You will see a lot of quills before the cloak unless you
            get extremely lucky. It took me about 15 spawns to get the cloak,
            which amounted to about 30 hours of non-consecutive playing time. As
            far as I am concerned, this is one of the longest and most
            frustrating camps in the game. Luckily, if you want to be an item
            hound, there are several other spawns very close by.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Near the door that leads to Gabbie,
            you will find a portcullis. Open it and go through. You are now in a
            small courtyard area that actually appears to be the font of the
            castle (there is a way to go up top and see the ballistas and
            Clockworks keeping watch over the battlements). To your right there
            is a hall leading out of this courtyard. Take it. In the hall you
            will see some Gnomish Conjurers and Miners – basically more of the
            same that you saw in the castle. Keep going on the path until you
            cross two bridges and come to a square room that should have two
            Clockworks in it. Stop. From here back to the portcullis is the
            walking path of the <b>Clockwork Model EXG</b>. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The EXG’s common drop is the
            Charred Guardian Shield (10AC +9 WIS) and the rare drop is the
            Charred Guardian Breastplate (16AC +3 STR +6 STA - LORE ITEM). The
            EXG is a female Clockwork who is larger than the rest of the clocks.
            If she is carrying the shield, you will see it on her. If not, she
            has the chest. She will pace back and forth between the square room
            and the castle portcullis. She is around level 30, hits hard and
            TOTALLY resistant to magic. This means that you can not root and
            nuke at all. You will need a tank. A level 50 Cleric can buff and
            Symbol and then heal in battle and solo the EXG down with melee, but
            it is very rough. As she paces between the castle and back room, the
            Gnome Conjurers will buff her. I suggest you Nullify Magic on her a
            few times before engaging. The best spot to fight her is on the
            castle-side of the larger bridge. There is a decent amount of room
            here, no other MOBs nearby to help if you do not have good faction,
            and no one in healing range.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Like Gabbie, the EXG spot spawns
            every 20 minutes or so and has &quot;placeholders&quot; that will
            spawn. These are other Clockworks and a Clockwork Spider Model SX.
            These are not quite at tough as the EXG and they can be cast upon.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Other Rare Spawns</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">:
            There are several rare spawns within a short jaunt of the Gnome
            Castle. They may drop items that you need, or they may simply help
            relieve the boredom of camping Gabbie or the EXG.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><b>Reckless Efreeti</b>: The
            Reckless Efreeti can be found behind the Gnomish Castle. Go out the
            back door of the Gnome area where the two guards stand in the square
            room. (the point at which the EXG turns around and walks back to
            castle). You will be at a T intersection. This entire area has
            Goblins in it so be prepared. Turn to your right and you will see a
            spike trap that opens and closes in the hall. There are two ways you
            can get to the Efreeti from here: go past the trap (like all others,
            it will not hurt you) and hug the left wall – you will fall into a
            pit with two Blazing Elementals (mid 20s?) and possibly the Efreeti.
            The other way to reach this spot and possibly be more certain of
            what is in the pit is to go into the doorway (no door) on the left
            before you reach the spike trap. Take the next door to the right and
            open the other door after it. In this room you will see a table and
            probably a Gob or two. Facing in from the door, the corner to your
            immediate right is a secret wall. Go into the wall and you will be
            in the Efreeti pit.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The Efreeti spot spawns every 40
            minutes or so and is located near the back of this small pit room.
            He drops the Platinum Armbands (No AC +3 WIS +3 STR) or the rare
            Obsidian Flamberge (20 dmg 50 dly effect: Obsidian Shatter WAR SK 2H
            Sword - No Drop/Lore). The bands are a very good item for Druids,
            and possibly others who have chosen to sacrifice AC for 3 wisdom.
            The Efreeti is most likely in the high 20s and is quite easy for a
            Cleric or Caster to kill. He only has around 1100 hit points. The
            two Elementals guard the Efreeti and spawn on a 20 minute cycle (so
            his spot spawns once every two of theirs). As far as I have seen,
            the two Ele’s are aggro, the Efreeti is not. A third Elemental
            will spawn in the Efreeti spot when he does not pop. Clear them all
            to get him to spawn and check back every 20 or so. There is a way to
            clear the Ele’s without having to do any real fighting – this is
            pretty obvious and I will let you find it out for yourself!<o:p>

            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><b>Goblin Captain</b>: The Captain
            can be found a few doors down from the Efreeti. Get your bearings in
            the room where the secret wall to the pit is. There are only two
            doors: the one you came in and the one you are about to go through
            to reach the Captain. Open the door and step into the Banner Room. I
            suppose it is worth mentioning that this area if full of mid 20s
            Goblins – be careful and don’t go alone if they are aggro to
            you. This room has for doors and, the captain is through the one
            directly in front of you. His spawn spot is in the middle of the
            back wall in this small room. Like everything else, his spot pops
            about every 20 minutes and he does not spawn every time. There are
            two other Goblins that spawn in this room as well. The Captain’s
            common drop is Charred Boots (AC6 +3 AGI +5 vs Fire and Poison) and
            rare is Charred Gauntlets (AC7 +3 DEX +5 INT). Both of these items
            are plate based armor.<o:p>

            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><b>Singe and Kindle</b>: Both of
            these MOBs wander the Goblin areas of SolA. Singe is a Fire Drake,
            Kindle a Fire Imp. Both are in the Mid to High 20s I believe. There
            are certain spots that players will camp to find these MOBs, but the
            place that I have come across them most often is at the
            T-intersection directly behind the Gnome’s backdoor (around the
            Spike Trap). Their &quot;holders&quot; wander by here. If you are
            looking for Singe and Kindle, kill the wandering Gobs and eventually
            they will pop. Singe carries the Obsidian Bead Hoop (AC2 +3 AGI +3
            INT) and the Drake Scale Belt (AC5 +3 DEX +10 vs Fire). Kindle
            carries the Obsidian Ring (AC3 +3 DEX +10 HP) and the highly prized
            Imp Skin Gloves (AC2 +5 INT +10 Mana).<o:p>

            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><b>Goblin Foreman and Kobold
            Predator</b>: You will find these two spawns between the Gnome
            Castle and the entrance from Lavastorm. Let us backtrack a little to
            L-bridge that brought us to the pendulum and lava room at the first.
            From this bridge, heading toward the pendulum…when you reach the
            end of the bridge – stop. There is a hallway to your left, take
            it. A few steps down this hall you will see a doorway. A few feet
            after this doorway, on the same wall, you will see a
            charred/darkened section of the wall. This is a secret door, go
            through it. You are now in another hallway. Go forward and take your
            first left, then right, then left again and you should be looking at
            a another secret doorway (you can usually tell by the small holes in
            the surface). Behind this wall is a small room with a well structure
            in it and three Goblins. The Foreman spawns in the middle spot here.
            Others will spawn in his spot. The Foreman Drops the Foreman Tunic
            (10AC 0 weight +3 STR +3 WIS) or the Obsidian Scimitar (6 dmg 27 dly
            +6 AGI).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">There is one door in the
            Foreman’s room. This leads to another room with a set of steps. On
            top of the steps, is where you will find the Kobold Predator. This
            is doggie is in the mid 20s and drops the Kobold-Hide Boots (AC5 +3
            AGI +10 HP) and the rare Obsidian Shard (6 dmg 25 dly Effect:
            Obsidian Shatter).<o:p>

            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">That is about if for the spawns,
            but I will leave you with this: There are rumors that there are more
            rare-spawn Gnomes in the Castle areas. There are also rumors of a
            full set of Charred Plate Armor coming from SolA. There is also one
            spawn that I have left unmentioned, due to the fact that it is so
            unknown I will wait to add it until it has become closer to common
            knowledge. It does not drop a cleric item.<o:p>

            There are several from SolA to SolB. The closest one to the
            Lavastorm entrance one is mentioned at the first of this guide. It
            is the zone near the ledge in front of the Stronghold. The Second is
            fairly tough to get to and found behind a secret wall in the middle
            of the Stronghold. It should be reflected on the map. The third and
            fourth zones are located near each other and can be found behind the
            Gnome Castle. Standing at the T-intersection, instead of turning
            right toward the spike-trap, turn left. The hall will immediately
            open into a small room area with a hall and door to the right. Go
            through this door and you are in yet another room (Gobs all around
            of course) there is a door to the right of you and a door in front.
            The door in front leads to a hallway that is a zone. The door on the
            right leads to a room that has a hallway to the left that is a zone.
            Those are all of the zones from A to B that I know of.<o:p>
