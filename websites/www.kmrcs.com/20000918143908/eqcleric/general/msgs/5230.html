: After several hours of killing necros in Befallen, I gave up and left.  I came back a few hours later, and looked around on the third floor.  Boondin Babbinsbort was there, with a pet.  He was in the room next to the SK that spawns the barbed legs.  He was behind a fallen pillar there, but I could see his pet walking back and forth behind the pillar.  He was blue to me at 30.  I blasted him 3 times with Wrath and he was wiped, although he didn't have much life left after 2.  I looted him and gated, not wanting to deal with his pet.  He also had a Dark Circlet on him.  No drop, necro only headband.  Something like AC2, plus 5 int and 10 mana.  It is probably for the necro armor quest or something, so expect some competition from them.  <p>: Lunara Silvermoon <br>: Quellious<p>
