Hmm, Low str sucks mid levels..  but at higher levels with armor.. i'm at usualy 55ish out of 70 base..

( i screwed up and didn't.. stuck at 170 wis at the moment and wishing i had more)<p>Test server:  Aye the possibility for a wipe is an evil thought..  but its part of being a tester.  But, unless something drastic happens, they plan never to wipe test, and haven't since final was released..  but it is allways a possibility..  ( but with the less crowding and friendlier people, take a look at some play times of high lvls there..   lvl 44 necro gnome..  his play time is around 26 days..  4 - 5 lvl 45+ all play times 29 - 34 days..  )<p>Its a sacrifice you have to take the chance on for playing such a good EQ shard :)<p>Clain<br>Rashklar<br>Test Server.<p>: I just started my first cleric earlier today.  I chose Teir'Dal, because I want to have that cool-looking plate someday, and I like to RP evil characters.  I put 25 points into Strength (to 90) and the last 5 in Wisdom (which brought it to 98).  I realize that at higher levels I will most likely want higher Wisdom, but I also want to be able to wear heavy armor so I can do alittle tanking if the need arises.<p>: I have played Teir'Dal before, so I knew how bad Nektulos is as far as newbie zones are.  So, first thing I do is visit the Necromancer and Thief guilds in Neriak. Why? Because I can get 2 6-slot bags for free!  With my 2 mini-backpacks I head to West Freeport. There I slaughtered as many snakes as I could for scales and fangs. When no snakes were available, I attacked Decaying Skeletons, Bats, and Rats (in that order). By the time I had reached level 3, my inventory was full. I hauled everything back to Neriak, sold everything but the snake scales, fangs, and eggs, and headed to the thieve's guild.
