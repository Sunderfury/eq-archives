            <p>I will try to lay out Cazic Thule dungeon for you as best as I
            can. I have spent the last 17 levels there (since level 20), and
            have found no place better for both exp or loot (Yesterday, in 14
            hours of hunting, I made 130 plat and was with a full group the
            entire time). However, one word of caution: it is very dangerous
            primarily due to mobs and trains, so if you are one of these folks
            that goes AFK a lot, you won't live very long. That having been
            said, let me see if I can give you a decent description of what to
            expect from Cazic. If I forget anything or screw something up, my
            apologies, and feel free to jump in with your own experiences or
            corrections in any errors I have made.</p>
            <p><strong>1. Monsters</strong>.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>A. Lizards</strong>. Almost all the monsters in here
              are lizards, with the exception of a few, and they carry
              everything from 1 copper up to 4 plat plus and rusty, bronze and
              fs (fine steel) weapons, as well as the most coveted items of all,
              the rubicite armor, which I will discuss separately. Obviously,
              the higher level lizzies carry the best loot, but not always. It
              varies, although you won't find the fs weapons on the lower level
              lizzies. However, with a full party of level 20s you can take on
              the lizzies right away that carry the fs weapons. The lizzies in
              order of difficulty are as follows, from the easiest to the most
              difficult: broodling, warrior and guard (bout the same), defender
              (this is the one that starts carrying the fs weapons), sentinel,
              proselytyte, disciple, page, herald, protector, fanatic, zealot,
              justicar, and judicator. There are three other &quot;special&quot;
              lizzies that carry the rubicite (red) armor, but I'll discuss them
              later. Prosletytes, disciples, heralds, pages, justicars and
              judicators are casters, and by that I mean they vary in having the
              same great spells the clerics do (after all this IS a temple) such
              as wrath (oh yeah, they'll hit ya for 400 pts. with one wrath if
              you are low level) and then the buff/heal spells, bravery and
              greater heal (heals 300 hps) which they use not ONLY on themselves
              prior to and at the beginning of battle, but during battle as well
              AND on any other lizzies that you are fighting as well as them.
              This is one of the things that makes it so difficult....you rarely
              ever can pull just one lizzie, and hopefully, if you pull more
              than two or more, one isn't a caster. If it is, don't panic, just
              take the caster lizzie out first and fast. This is where wizzes
              come in REAL handy cause they can pop them for big dmg with their
              spells. At higher levels (29+), clerics should switch to the
              &quot;wiz&quot; mode if a big caster lizzie comes, and take it
              down FAST after stunning it with Force to stop its casting, then
              using wrath on it. Believe me, it will cost you less mana to take
              it out fast than it will cost you in healing all your tanks after
              the lizzie heals itself 4 or 5 times and the tanks have no hps
              left. The higher level lizzies are still sometimes hitting me for
              64 dmg, even tho I am now level 37 with good armor.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>B. Alligators</strong> The gators in here are little
              gators, about 1/10 the size of the caimens and crocodiles in
              oasis, but you ain't never been bitten by a gator til one of these
              takes a bite out of your arse. They are little but bite like
              lockjaw in oasis when you were in your teens. Don't even try to
              take these on til you are in your high 20s, because you can never
              pull just one from the tanks and sometimes one of the high level
              lizzies comes along. And they will attack anything that is near
              it, regardless of whether your group pulled it.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>C. Golems</strong> So far, three golems have been
              found: clay, stone and steel. Golems, along with three other
              special lizards and one other monster, are what carry the rubicite
              armor. They are pretty tough critters in and of themselves, but
              the problem is, they are guarded by several other high level
              lizzies, including casters, and they ALWAYS come with it when you
              pull it. And the developers have located these golems in areas
              that aren't close to the zone, so you either have a far distance
              to run or have to swim out of a tank then run uptairs to the
              courtyard and THEN head for the zone. That's when you will be glad
              you are a cleric with GATE, or have a shaman/druid in your group
              that keeps everyone SOWd.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>D. Gorillas</strong> (or Rillas, as they are
              affectionately called, or Magillas) These hairy guys are big, and
              guard the throne downstairs on the first level of the Throne Room.
              They are big, mean and tough and hit hard if you are under level
              30.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>2. Rubicite Armor</strong><br>
            This is some of the most coveted armor AND most difficult to acquire
            in the game. It is red and the equivalent of plate, but is magical
            (although it doesn't add anything to stats) and very light. Not to
            mention how incredibly COOL it looks (LOL). The following monsters
            and their locations are what carry the rubicite armor. The problem
            is, these monsters spawn very infrequently (some take 3 - 4 hours
            between spawns), do not carry the rubi everytime (maybe one out of 4
            or 5 times it spawns, and more), and are ALWAYS camped with a long
            list of people waiting to get to that area to get into the group and
            get in line for the rubi.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>A. Greaves (leggins)</strong> The Taew Eew Templar
              lizzie carries the rubi leggins. It spawns (infrequently) on the
              Throne in the downstairs, or first level, of what is known as the
              Throne Room. It also drops the lizardscale cloak (AC8, +5 Dex).</p>
              <p><strong>B. Gloves</strong> The steel golem carries the rubi
              gloves, and the spawn rate and frequency of having the gloves is
              same as above for the leggins. The steel golem lives downstairs
              through one of the tanks you must swim down and through and then
              up a ladder in an area off of what is known as the gator tunnel.
              This used to be a relatively safe area until they made the gators
              aggro, so now, even mid-30s to level 40 players have to be careful
              because you can get mobbed by gators even if you don't pull the
              golem, and if you can't evac with a wiz or have gate, you are in a
              world of hurt trying to zone out.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>C. Helmet</strong> The rubi helmet is carried by the
              stone golem, who spawns on a throne upstairs in the Throne Room,
              known as the Second Floor Throne Room. Spawn rate for golem and
              frequency of having the helmet is same. This is a tough area, and
              only groups of mid-35s should attempt it. It's tough because of
              the spawn that comes from downstairs, in the room itself, from a
              room to the left, and upstairs on third floor where the golem
              spawns. This room and its surrounds, with the exception of the
              downstairs, has all the high level lizzies, such as the zealots,
              heralds, prots, justicars and judicators.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>D. Boots</strong> The Cazic Cenobite lizzie carries
              these, with same spawn rate and frequency. It spawns inside a
              little dip below the huge green bubble downstairs that you swim
              down to to get to an area to base to hunt from. It's not too
              tough, but it is a caster. Again, this is a spot for levels 35+,
              and has same high level lizzies and gators thrown in just to make
              it interesting.</p>
              <p><strong>E. Breastplate</strong> The toughest monster found so
              far in Cazic carries this, with same spawn and frequency. It
              spawns in same spot inside the big green bubble downstairs where
              the Cenobite lizzie spawns. It is known as the Avatar of Fear, and
              believe me, it is the biggest, ugliest thing in all Cazic, and
              will take you out in a heartbeat. If it is alone (infrequently), a
              group of full 35+ can do it ...the problem comes when a judicator
              or two shows up or spawns right after, and then stands there and
              buffs and heals the damn avatar while the group is trying to kill
              it, and at the same time starts whaling on YOU, the cleric, when
              you're trying to heal your tanks who are getting the crap kicked
              out of em by the avatar. A very dangerous monster, my friends.
              Beware.</p>
              <p><strong>F. Bracers</strong> The Taew Eew Diviner carries these,
              with same frequency and spawn rate. It spawns on the downstairs
              throne where the Templar with the greaves spawns. About the same
              difficulty, except for one difference: this little lizzie will
              CHARM and charm REAL good. Our group has almost been killed by our
              tank who pulled and then got charmed and started beating the crap
              outta all of us.&nbsp; His secondary drop is the Lizardscale
              Mantle, +3 Int and +3 wisdom.</p>
              <p><strong>G. Rubicite Vambraces (Arms)</strong> The Tae Ew Archon
              (archaron?) drops these.&nbsp; His common drop is the Lizardscale
              Belt, AC2, HP +10, Mana +10, All/All.&nbsp; He is located at the
              top of the pyramid like temple which is on the other side of the
              maze.&nbsp; Directions through the maze (ed. send in corrections,
              if any, please) are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Enter the maze through the door in the courtyard</li>
                <li>Turn left at the first crossroads</li>
                <li>Follow the passage and take the right turn where you can see
                  a room with four pillars ahead of you (2nd right turn?).</li>
                <li>Go straight across this room and take the 2nd left turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                <li>This is a long tunnel to some steps which lead into the
                  temple area.</li>
                <li>This is a very dangerous area with a lot of high level
                  lizards (fanatics, zealots, justicars, and judicators).</li>
                <li>At the top ring of the temple is a room inside.&nbsp; This
                  is where the Tae Ew Archon drops the arms.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>3. Hunting Areas and Levels</strong><br>
            The Cazic temple is HUGE with lots of hunting areas upstairs,
            downstairs, and throughout. I will try to tell you in general where
            they are, with appropriate levels to hunt at, but the best thing is
            to just go yourself and get with someone who is familiar with the
            dungeon.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Levels 20 - 30</strong>: You should stay either in the
              zone area (corridor) or the courtyard (cy) outside the double
              doors of the zone area. Broodlings, warriors and guards usually
              travel or guard this zone corridor and will attack you if you are
              medding. The danger with hunting in the corridor zone area is the
              huge number of trains that come by from folks that are zoning. You
              are better off to base around the perimeter of the cy to avoid
              these constant trains, and so your casters can med in relative
              safety. You should pull defenders and sentinels from what is known
              as the maze (named this for a good reason). The maze is through a
              door to the right when you enter the cy. Be careful pulling if you
              don't know the maze...there are many many lizzies in there who
              will attack you, and you will get lost easily in the corridors and
              die very fast. Don't go in very deep until you learn the maze.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Levels 30 - 35</strong>: You can now advance to the
              downstairs throne room (has med - high level lizzies with the
              rillas) which is through the door on the left side of the cy, or
              head downstairs to the gator tunnel, or pull gators to the
              courtyard from one of the tanks that are located up the ladder on
              one side of the courtyard, or up the ladder on the other side then
              downstairs. There is also an area known as the Arena, which is
              through a door and down several corridors on the opposite side of
              the throne room. There are the higher level lizzies here, such as
              the heralds, prots, zealots, fanatics, justicars and judicators,
              with some medium ones such as sentinels thrown in. You will have
              to fight your way down the corridors through sents and defenders
              to get to the arena. Another good area less frequented is known as
              the Upstairs Temple. You get to this by going through the maze. It
              is a square area, with higher level lizzies that spawn on the four
              corners, and some that are &quot;wanderers&quot;. There are stairs
              up here that also lead to like 4 more levels and at the top level,
              a tank. You will have to fight your way through the maze to
              upstairs, unless you get a wiz who can inviso everyone (I highly
              recommend this...I do not travel the maze unless I am inviso) Once
              upstairs, clear the corner to the left, then move around clearing
              the next corner, and base in center of next hallway and pull as
              the corners respawn, or go up the stairs and pull from there.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Levels 35 +</strong>: You're big, bad and tough now,
              and with a full group the same levels, can take on anything else
              in cazic. But don't get cocky, because as I said, these lizzies
              and gators, not to mention the avatar, seldom come without their
              buds, so be prepared for fighting up to 4 at a time if you are in
              the second floor throne room, with a gator or two or three thrown
              in for good measure if you go downstairs to the Avatar area or
              steel golem area.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><strong>4. Tips on Hunting Cazic</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>A. Grouping</strong>. Always hunt with full group if
              you can. This is dangerous place. And have a well-rounded group,
              which is safest. Two clerics I've found in a group are great,
              along with someone who can SOW, two good tanks and a wiz who can
              nuke the bejeebers out of em. A monk or ranger with good range
              skills (bow) are TERRIFIC, since they have the ability to pull
              just one at a time. I've lived a lot longer with a good puller...a
              bad puller will get you killed LOTS and you'll spend all your time
              zoning with trains on you, that tend to make you VERY unpopular
              with the others hunting there.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>B. Trains</strong>. Oh yeah, they are big, bad and
              frequent. Primarily because of the difficulty in pulling just one
              or two monsters. Most folks are good about yelling train tho...it's
              a close knit community inside Cazic and woe to the person who
              constantly trains without warning others and gets other groups
              killed. It isn't long before that person can't find anyone to hunt
              with. If a party zones with a train on them, the lizzies will
              return to the cy or stay in the corridor zone area and jump on
              anyone else who is around. This hurts big time when your group is
              itself engaged in a fight with 2 or 3 lizzies, and 3 more jump in.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>C. Outside the zone</strong>. In all their great
              wisdom, the developers have placed Bouncers (big bad, very very
              fast and hard hitting ogres) who patrol outside and around the
              temple ramp where you need to enter, and have now started coming
              into the &quot;safe&quot; zone area (corridor) where everyone
              zones out to from the temple. One of these ogres can take me out
              in about 4 seconds flat, but they usually come into the
              &quot;safe&quot; corridor area in twosies, and with both whaling
              on you, have taken out over half my hps in like 1 or 2 seconds
              before I managed to zone back into cazic. They kill many people
              who have zoned out with low hps, only to be met by one of these
              nasty ogres. One of my friends died 4 times in that corridor in
              about 3 minutes...he was bound right there and got killed, and
              everytime he reappeared the ogres killed him again. He was NOT
              happy.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>D. Healing</strong>. By now you have learned that when
              you are fighting a mob, the first heal you cast is gonna draw the
              mobs onto you big time. Nowhere is that more true than in Cazic.
              Lizzies HATE healers more than any other monster I've found, and
              they won't let you med during a fight, and will beat on you with a
              vengeance soon as you heal. Make damn sure you are in group that
              some can taunt or pull off you, and make sure they know that if
              you get hit, you will not be able to cast to keep the party alive.
              It is imperative that the group protect you, because you will die
              very quickly in a mob after you cast that first heal. Keep Root or
              Enstill memmed so you can at least root them until one of the
              tanks can pull them off you. I've also found Wave of Fear to be
              useful to make the whole mob run long enough for the group to zone
              and me to gate. ALWAYS keep gate and your invulnerable spell
              memmed and always SOW on you...it can mean the difference quite
              frequently in whether you make it out or not.</p>

            <p><strong>4. Conclusion</strong><br>
            I hope I've given you sort of a thumbnail of Cazic. I know I've
            forgotten lots of things, so if you have any questions, post them on
            the board and I'll try to answer them for everyone. I have hunted
            Cazic almost exclusively since I was level 20 (I am level 37 now)
            and have found no other place that can beat it for exp and loot or
            making really good friends. This is where all the high level players
            on The Rathe levelled. I have been very fortunate in that I have
            been able to acquire rubi boots, gloves, bracer, greaves and helmet.
            BTW, the location of Cazic Thule is through the Innothule swamps.
            You have to swim across a short river and then follow the edge of
            the temple on your left around to the ramp that takes you up to the
            corridor that leads into the zone. The bad thing is, that with so
            many people in Cazic now, the PL and lag can be deadly, not to
            mention the constant trains. But once you get high enough and can go
            into those out of the way areas, the only trains you have to worry
            about are YOURS. Good luck to you all, and may the light of
            Mithaniel Marr forever keep you safe and guide you in your journeys.</p>
