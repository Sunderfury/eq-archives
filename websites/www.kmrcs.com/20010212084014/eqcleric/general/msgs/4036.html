: Huting Priest in lower Guk last night, 4 hours a bouble of exp, a bag and a fairly reasnable braclet (5 ac, +3 wis, +15 hp - although as a rare drop of the preist it seams a bit weak), I was ready to log. The last fight (waiting for my replacment to arrive), ended up with me dying and losing that bouble of exp.

: To cut a long story short, betwean getting the group reorgansied, trains, clearing the way, getting more people in to help, etc. I took almost 2 hours just to get my corpse.

: When I did it was it was at the zone rather than the preist sport were I dided (had to petition a GM becouse my corpse was no there), and the other cleric in the party was on the other side of Guk.

: This spot isnt the hardest spot in the game to get to and all but myself lived. Imageon the situation were you are fighting in a harder place, or were the whole party dies.

: Exp is not a side effect of these spells. The resurection line of spells is for clerics to bring people back to life. As there is no perminant death in this game exp is resored instead.

: It was nurfed becouse people were looting and dragging there corpses back to the zone cousing lag, either to get exp reses or use as a teleport.

: This hack does not cure people using it as a teleport. It does certainly help reduce lag on corpses (For those that arn't after a corpse taxi service).

: The cost of this is that is yet again nurfes the ability of people grouped up to use the spell as it was intended.

: Surley a simpler more realistic and less damaging solution would have been dont exp res the corpse after it has been looted.
