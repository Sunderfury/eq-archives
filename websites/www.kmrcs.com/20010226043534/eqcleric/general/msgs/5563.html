: Hi,<br>: cant you see what Verent have done? We have been training all our lives from level 8 when we first got meditate for this moment.  Cant you remember back to all the times when you just sat through battles stairing at the book?  You should embrace the 6hr camp as the ultimate cleric challenge. At least we get to stair at something new (tree stump/water column etc..) instead of the damn book, theres only so many perimitations of spell orders that are possible after all.<p>: I say double the time and make all the items needed spawn in all the boring, no visit zones. Also put them in night zones (like kithkor) so that even though you have the novelty of being able to see stuff whilst just sitting there, you cant actually see anything because its to damn dark.<p>: hehehe.<p>the least they could have done is let us context switch out the the desktop and maybe play Hearts or Minesweeper or something...maybe ICQ a friend.<p>good thing the screensaver doesn't activate with all that idelness :)<p>-OrkinMan
