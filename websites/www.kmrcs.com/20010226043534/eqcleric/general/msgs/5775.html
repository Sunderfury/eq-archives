I just hit Level 24 yesterday (Joy)... <p>Well anyhow things were going good for the most part with the<br>group I was with then people started coming and going.  Joined<br>another group as first group dissolved and they were camping<br>balcony in Unrest.  That group disassembled later other than <br>1 or 2 people, so we moved back to the lawn pulling.  I had now<br>over 2 bubbles into 24.  Joined a 3rd group comprised of 3 Wizards<br>and another cleric and a level 21 paladin.  Wizards ranged from<br>24 - 27.  Thought I was gonna be ok if we didn't pull too much<br>which is always a risk with Unrest.  Well first pull the puller<br>gets rooted inside.  So I go in with the Level 27 wizard.  I give<br>the puller a greater heal as he's down to bubble of life, then<br>I try to run out.  I'm rooted at door and killed and <br>group members all run and leave me other than the 22 cleric.<br>So I'm kinda ticked off!  Only ones who die are the 21 Paladin,<br>myself and the 22 Cleric.  All wizzies make it safely as <br>they didn't bother to help.<p>Next Pull, paladin pulls all of 2nd floor in waves so we don't<br>sense it at first.  Well level 27 wizzie is in deep trouble<br>so I cast greater heal saving him, but pulling 3 carrions<br>onto me with no one helping me again, other than 22 cleric.<p>I die, everyone else lives.  Should I not use greater heal<br>in battle when there are lots of mobs?  Should I just yell run<br>and save myself instead of saving others?  Seemed all wizzies<br>only cared about themself?  What in the heck should I do, I don't <br>like being the Martyr and saving someone to lose exp for myself<br>unless I am safely into a level and they aren't.  I'm barely <br>24 now and kinda of pissed off.<p>Any suggestions, recommendations?<br>Walterscott Level 24 (almost 23 again) Cleric
