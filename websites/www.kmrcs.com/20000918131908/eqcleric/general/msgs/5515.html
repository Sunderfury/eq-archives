Don't think he's the same faction as the rest of highpass... he was indifferent to me.  Highpass guards and most citizens are dubious...<br>Erondil<p>: <br>: I wonder if Jovan the Fervent is indifferent, that is NOT tied to the CitizensOfHighpass faction. I am a dark elf and killed on sight in Highpass hold and Highkeep. If Jovan - like the other quest item persons I have met while doing the boots quest - is indifferent I could kill orcs in Kithicor (the named ones) and gain faction that way, and being non KOS in Highkeep, get the item from Jovan. <p>: // Mirixia on Vallon Zek<p>
