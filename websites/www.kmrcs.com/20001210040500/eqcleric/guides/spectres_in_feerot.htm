            <p><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong>:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Head to Cazic Thule Dungeon in the Feerott.&nbsp; When you get
              to the ramp, instead of going up it, keep on going and follow the
              dungeon wall around (keep dungeon wall to you LEFT).&nbsp; Keep
              heading straight after the dungeon wall ends until you come to
              river (I believe this is south/sw).&nbsp; Swim across.&nbsp; When
              you get across, take a left and a very short distance is the zone
              wall. Keep zone wall on your left and follow it down a ways til
              you see a tree right there on the zone wall on your left.&nbsp;
              THAT is the fake wall and the entrance to the spectre cave.&nbsp;
              Just walk on through.&nbsp; The cave is pretty easy to follow.&nbsp;
              When you enter, as you walk up, there is sort of a circular area
              where to your right 1 or 2 spectres spawn.&nbsp; This is very very
              easy spot to pull from.&nbsp; If there are none there, follow the
              corridor in.&nbsp; It's very very easy, and not like the maze in
              cazic.&nbsp; The best thing is, when you see one, if you cast Fear
              on it, all you gotta do it is just get behind it and it will lead
              you out of the dungeon!!!&nbsp; No getting lost!!</p>

            <p><strong>HOW TO HUNT SPECTRES</strong>:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Now, there is a BIG key to hunting these things safely.&nbsp;
              Just fyi, I soloed them yesterday morning for GREAT exps.&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Only high level casters can do this...tanks can't.&nbsp; It's your
              basic root and shoot&nbsp; routine.&nbsp; But the first thing you
              MUST do to get them out of the cave so their buds don't come
              running is cast FEAR on them, or Spook the Dead (whatever your
              lowest mana cost spell is). This makes them run outta the cave.&nbsp;
              As they exit the cave, ROOT them.&nbsp; Run a distance from them
              and turn and blast away with your highest undead spell.&nbsp; When
              they run towards you after root wears off, run away and turn and
              root again, then blast again.&nbsp; These things have about 1800 -
              2200 hps.&nbsp; It takes me 2 - 3 Banish Undeads (585 dmg a pop)
              and a 2 - 4 Wraths (218 dmg a pop) to take them down.&nbsp; I do
              not recommend soloing them until you are level 44 with Banish
              Undead and Resist Magic and Resolution buffs.<br>
              <br>
              IMPORTANT THINGS&nbsp; TO KNOW TO HUNT SPECTRES:</p>
            </blockquote>
            <ol>
              <li>You must have SOW on at all times, otherwise you are gonna be
                one dead cleric.&nbsp; If you don't have jboots or someone that
                can SOW, you gonna be a hurtin.</li>
              <li>There is a relatively safe spot to med in between kills, or a
                &quot;camp&quot; spot to pull to if you keep going after you
                pass up the cave entrance on your left.&nbsp; It is a very very
                short distance down, and the zone wall ends there and forms a
                sort of 90 degree corner, with the zone wall continuing. This
                corner is where everyone meds and camps.</li>
              <li>If you MUST run to safety, the zone to the Rathe Mountains is
                straight down the zone wall from that corner where you med (just
                keep zone wall on your left at all times and you'll come to the
                zone entrance).</li>
              <li>VERY IMPT:&nbsp; These spectres are sneaky.&nbsp; BEFORE you
                go into the cave to pull, to the left and up a tad from the safe
                corner med spot are some trees. Spectres, sometimes 3 at a time,
                will spawn here. (They KNOW we are sitting there in the corner
                medding..heh).&nbsp; Do NOT pull from the cave until you check
                this spawn spot, otherwise, you are gonna be in a world of hurt
                when you bring a spectre back from the cave and a couple of his
                buds behind those trees decide to come help him out.</li>
              <li>AVOID MELEE.&nbsp; You don't want these dang things within
                striking distance of you, or you're gonna go down.&nbsp; You
                simply can't tank them because of their spell that drains your
                life force and their hard hitting and stunning. This is why you
                must have SOW on, or jboots to be able to run from far enough
                from them so you can keep them rooted while you blast away.</li>
              <li>Keep yourself highly buffed at ALL times, especially with
                Resist Magic. I keep Symbol of Pinzarn, Armor of Faith,
                Resolution and Resist Magic on me at ALL times when hunting
                these things.</li>
              <li>If you have a tank with you, they can taunt and keep the
                spectre occupied (root doesn't become so impt then) while you
                stand at a distance and blast away.</li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Hope this helps you guys out.&nbsp; As I said, I wouldn't
              attempt to solo these bad boys until I was level 44 with those
              good spells.&nbsp; They are perfect for what you need to hunt
              spectres.</p>
