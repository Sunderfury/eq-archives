All of mistmoore is around 35, except for the named vampires.  It is very hard to do at 35, because when you are fighting can have a LOT of MOBs on you, with the majority of them being spellcasters.  The learning curve in this zone is very like Unrest the first time you were there (okay the first time I was there).  Like Unrest, you can pull MOBs from other parts of the castle when you are fighting in different areas.<p>The trains are worse than any zone I've ever seen.
