</FONT><HR>First, check out this thread and Rafeco's table.  <a href="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/Forum1/HTML/000081.html">Rafeco thread</a>.<P>Now think about this:<BR><ul><BR><li>The chain classes, shamans, rangers, rogues?, for some odd reason, have better AC than the plate classes.  Don't get upset, just absorb the info.</li><BR><li>For the most part, the distribution of the stat bonuses are disappointing.  With the exception of basically the rangers, it doesn't seem that anyone's chest/leg pieces are all that class specific.</li><BR><li>Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but for the chain wearers this stuff is as good as it gets, right?  Except for the PoF that is.</li><BR><li>We plate wearers still have many better pieces available don't we?  With the exception of Rubi chest, we can still acquire tons of great AC pieces.  The only sacrifice we clerics would have to make is wisdom.</li><BR><li>Verant only promised to make class-specific substitutes for Rubi.  They never claimed to make pre-PoF armor.</li><BR><li>Verant delivered on their promise.</li><BR><li>I grant all those disappointed (I am too) that I wish they would have given us (and all the other classes) really good items for chests and legs.  They just didn't.  I have to wonder why.</li><BR><li>I do feel, that looking at Rafeco's chart, that there was little, if any, overall coordination between the designers on armor creation.  Furthermore, it appears that the stat buffs were not particularly well thought out for each class, once again Rangers being a possible exception.</li><BR><li>I also think Verant has lost focus of why we play the game.  We are not exactly interested in playing a Norrathian simulation; we play for fun.  <i>Stump Watch</i> and it's cousins are not fun.  They still, if they haven't, need to re-tool our quests, and possibly some of the others (I hear Paladin's have it worse).</li><BR></ul><P>Verant DID deliver on it's promise of class specific quests; they just missed an opportunity to score a huge win.<P>------------------<BR>Rayne Woundbane<BR>Karana Server<BR>http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000047.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Quests/Items&TopicSubject=Still+thinking+about+the+quest+armor">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Absorbtion complete.  <P>I'm half tempted to roll up a bard.  If you look at it, they have the 2nd best set of armor in the quests.  It makes sense that warriors have the buffest.  But BARDS?  WTF is THAT?<P>2ndly, If I were a paladin, I'd bail. They got HOSED w/ armor that's tied for worst in all of this.  Tied w/ CLERICs.  Why would I bail?  Well, lets not forget that Paladins are a MELEE class.  We're not, so with THAT in mind, I'd say they have the biggest bitch.<P>3rd, Rangers got a close 2nd in the BEST armor buffs.  Did you see all the Wisdom & STR buffs they got,, PLUS the some of the highest AC values.  I can't remember where, but I saw a stat that showed that Rangers were the single most played class in the game.<P>It was always my impression that, if you research the roll of a ranger in ANY fantasy setting, rangers were NOT able to wear plate.  Why?  they gotta plunk around in the woods, & stuff.  Wearing bulky plate armor does not lend itself to this function, but they've been given some of the best!  Why is this?<P>I'm half tempted to pick back up on the Troll Warrior I started many moons ago.  At least it seems as if Verant actually gives a crap about them. <P>I hope this made sense, I'm in a hurry...<P>------------------<BR>Tomma Trueheart<BR>Priestess of Mithaniel Marr, 26th Rosary<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000047.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Quests/Items&TopicSubject=Still+thinking+about+the+quest+armor">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I've been going over this stuff for a week now and wondering why some of these choices were made.  I still have no answers, and I am loathe to sink to the level of some who will claim there is favoritism to rangers (not you guys, just something else someone likes to say).<P>A guildmate, a paladin by trade, sent McQuaid a letter by email talking baout some issues with the paladins after the quests started.  He recieved a short 4 line reply that pretty much missed the point.  If one looks at historical references, literature and games, and even logic then one can easily get an idea of where things should stand and how it should all boil down.<P>As far as classes go, warriors are the most versatile and most skilled with their weapons and armor.  This makes sense.  They don't spend time skulking in forests or reading holy texts for enlightenment.  They also have no real restrictions on armament or armor as they just want to kick tail.<P>Paladins are heavy fighters.  They wear cumbersome plate armor.  This makes them slow and offsets that benefit of armor a little bit.  For the most part, at least in EQ, they wield heavier weapons because their armor prevents the freedom of movement for dual wielding or kicking.  They get bash as a trade off for the kick though.  You get the idea.<P>Rangers are lightly armored.  I kind of got the idea of considering them like infantry.  Damn good fighters, and very versatile, but they can't wear that heavy armor cause it would bog them down.  They get the dual wield as they are free to move, and they get kick instead of bash.  The freedom of movement offsets the benefits they would have gotten for heavier armor.<P>I'd have to say, and I'm likely to mess this up, that shamen are sort of the lightly armored and more versatile (as far as weapons and spells at least) version of a cleric.  The above arguments for paladins and rangers can be twisted to suit this comparison.<P>Clerics of course are healers, and heavy plate wearers.  Great heals means less versatility in other spells (still awe struck at some of our spells though) and or course heavy armor so we can stand our ground with resolution and defiance.<P>Just breaking the classes down so simply we can see how the AC values on the class armor don't quite fit.  Everyone got some odd stats that don't fit of course, but I'm sticking to the  AC for now.  <P>If this stuff replaces rubicite, then shouldn't it have all started with the ac for rubi?  It might have I suppose.  But then someone seems to have gotten the idea that to add stats, you take away ac.  Hardly seems right when the bards had stats and rubi ac was left alone.  Warrior armor is great for the warriors, and they should have the highest ac of course.  The other four seem to stick out like a sore thumb though.  It looks like they were designed by four different people who didn't talk and lived in different states. *smiles slightly*<P>Now I am sure they were trying to balance it out by the fact that we have spells which raise AC by huge amounts and hitpoints as well.  Oddly enough, rangers, shaman, and paladins all have spells that add to ac though.  Maybe not as much (good lord though those shaman can raise practically everything else too.  hehe), but they still get a bonus to their ac.  So maybe they added more ac to classes that didn't have the best buffs.  But then that would decrease the reasons to group, wouldn't it?<P>Well, there's all manner of ways to look at this and reason, and go backward and sideways.  Unfortunately we can't know for sure what the people who made it were thinking until someone sends an email asking exactly that.  I guess we just need to ask the reasoning behind this.<P>Of course the stats are another story.  Maybe they think we try to min/max our primary stat too much.  Personally I like some agility and I could use more strength to carry that stuff (which reminds me that if the ranger stuff has such a high ac, I think our stuff shouldn't weigh so much more than it).  If one looks at the stats for various armor and compares them though, clerics just some pretty odd stat raises.  Don't get me wrong, I like Int as much as anyone who raises their skills, but I just don't get it.  Sure would have been nice to get +3 wis on the chest plate or greaves.  Or maybe a strength boost on the chest plate instead.  I'm far too baffled by this area of it to even offer suggestions why they do it this way.<P>There's definately something odd going on here.  And I find it interesting that cleric armor was in on Test before the others.  But for some reason it just doesn't jive with pre conceived notions of being a cleric or a plate wearer.  I sure hope someone asks verant for a rational in this soon.  At least then we'd have something that we could not at and either grudgingly agree or disagree with rather than just calling it bad.<P>I can only wonder what a quest armor for druids would have looked like.  Probably pink and raise charisma.  *smiles and winks*  Paladins definately got the shaft though.  I would still like to at least hear what color the paladin armor is.  <P><P>------------------<BR>Daen Sunguide<BR>Hammer of Tunare on Karana<BR>"Beware of priests bearing False Dawns."<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000047.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Quests/Items&TopicSubject=Still+thinking+about+the+quest+armor">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>It seems obvious to me that the way the quests were implemented was just the result of a mistake.  Paladin, shadowknight, and cleric armor should have the same AC and weight as the bard armor. <P>The current armor is worse protection than rubicite (and rogue/shaman/ranger armor, which is identical to rubicite), and weighs more.  I think that they threw in the three classes I just mentioned when they decided to get rid of Rubicite, and the people that they had been working on longer suffered.<P>Bards are a plate armor class, they deserve good armor (better than rangers).  The problem is what they did with the other plate classes.<P>------------------<BR>Jord<BR>Cleric of Brell<BR>Povar Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000047.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Quests/Items&TopicSubject=Still+thinking+about+the+quest+armor">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>After reading these posts and others on various boards, I begin to wonder about the removal of Rubi and the "new" armor.<P>As I recall Brad made a comment that rubi was never intended for the masses.  If this is Verants focus, then the new armor should NOT have the same values as Rubi. Otherwise whats the point of the new armor if it mirrors rubi.<P>That said, I too am confused by the introduction of armor that is below par with stuff already in the game.  The bloodstained tunic for example is +4 wis.  This item comes off a level 29 or so mob, but is rare drop.  On the open market it sells for between 450-600pp depending on who wants it.<P>One of the items for the cleric bp is found on a mob (bilge) that spawns less often than the Knight in unrest does.  Plus you have to buy 3 bars of plat at a cost of around 370pp.  The mob is reported to be around the same level as the Knight in unrest....yet the stats on the bp are terrible in comparison to the BS Tunic (chainmail for gods sake).<P>I know, he has the belt and sometimes the kedge totem, but that only increases the number of people now camping him...so when he does spawn..he dies fast and the last time I checked,my level 35 cleric could not out gun a level 50 druid who is also looking for him.<P>Well off I go to camp for the only piece of the puzzle that adds wisdom...see all you others there I'm sure  <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000047.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Quests/Items&TopicSubject=Still+thinking+about+the+quest+armor">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>450-600pp is a very high estimate for a BS tunic as far as I have seen. I normally see them in unrest for less than 200pp.<P>Maybe they should have called the Chestplate of the Constant the BS tunic, but not as in blood stained.<p>[This message has been edited by Ramulet (edited 10-22-1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000047.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=Quests/Items&TopicSubject=Still+thinking+about+the+quest+armor">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I really don't agree, Rayne<P><list><BR><LI> For some odd reason Verant "balanced the classes" such that trade offs were made for those classes that are able to wear plate. No longer the case now because by their mid 30's every ranger, rogue, and shaman will have relatively easy access to a higher AC than their cleric and, likely, paladin party members.<BR><LI> The rangers' armor seems particularly unbalanced compared to the other classes armor<BR><LI> Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but for the "plate classes" armor, excluding bards, this stuff's AC is as low as store-bought plate, right?<BR><LI> We plate wearers have the same options we did before the quests excepting rubi which was better AC and lighter, could be acquired faster, cheaper and arguably with more fun.<BR><LI> Verant only promised to make class-specific substitutes for Rubi. They never claimed to make pre-PoF armor.<BR><LI> For the plate wearers, Verant delivered armor lower in AC and heavier than rubi with questionable stat bonuses that takes a large time investment to acquire.<BR><LI> I'm dissapointed in the rubi substitute armor too, not just the legs and chest; all of it is fairly useless for clerics and pallys taking into account the loot available on mid-30's mobs.<BR><LI> I do feel, that looking at Rafeco's chart, alot of people at Verant play rangers (tongue in cheek, hehe)<BR><LI> I also think Verant put these quests in without much field testing. I know they checked the quest givers to be sure you get your armor when you turn in the required materials, although that was still broken before the patch's patch. No one in their right mind could have attempted these quests and after completion said, "You know' I'll bet there are thousands of people that will enjoy what I just endured".  They still, if they haven't, need to re-tool our quests, and definitely some of the others (I hear Paladin's quests make cleric's look like a orc pawn killin').<BR></list><BR><P>------------------<BR>Derenath Enikinteel [Emef'Aitch]<BR>40+ Dwarven Cleric<BR>-=Bah yer na' 'urt, walk it off =-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000047.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Quests/Items&TopicSubject=Still+thinking+about+the+quest+armor">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I have a friend who's started exploring the Paladin Quests.  They seem tough.  They have to go talk to someone and told "You must raise your faction with such-and-such group."  So they have to go kill and kill and kill to raise the faction.  Then they have to collect the items for the armor by killing monsters.  Then they have to buy the molds.  And more stuff.  Very tough.  He's moaning about it.<P>My response: AT LEAST YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING!!  Imagine sitting and staring at dirt for 7 to 19+ hours doing absolutely nothing.  I would much rather have to go out and kill hundreds of orcs to raise my faction than sit at the burned cabin for 7.<P>He agreed.

</FONT><HR>Sorry Rayne, the "we have more options for Pre-PoF armor" argument just doesn't wash. <P>If they are not going to provide reasonable reward for our quests, why have the quests in the game at all?  These quests are a waste of time, (except for the CoSacrament weapon, which isn't very useful when I am medding full time).  <P>If I complete a quest that is as hard or harder then the quests of other classes I want a reward that is at least equal if not better (clerics are a plate wearing class, ROFL).  Some real stat bonuses would be nice too.<P>I'm starting an enchanter, i'm just bored being a cleric.<P>YoLaTengo</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000047.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=Quests/Items&TopicSubject=Still+thinking+about+the+quest+armor">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I for one am not thinking about the new quest armor.  I've decided that the trade off of time put into it (I spent 5 straight hours waiting for Maugrim to spawn when I could have leveled soloing Giant Skels in Rathe Mountains).  That and it annoys me to see how easy some other classes have it (though not Paladins from what I've heard).  I was with a group that killed a named cyclops (for Ranger armor) in Rathe Mountains (we didn't know who or what he was for, but we killed him anyway).  Now that shouldn't get me upset, and truthfully it doesn't too much.  Until I remember that we killed him not even 10 minutes later.  We also slayed Grimfeather in N. Karana, and my group killed some named Brownie in GF while I was waiting for Maugrim to show up (must have been her day off because I didn't see her).  Asked a Wizard in my group how long it took him to get his Runes of Scale for this cloak, and he said not very long.  But then they come off of just regular MOBs too.<P>I know this is starting to turn into a rant, so I'll stop now.  But my point is that I don't think that the time trade off is worth it.<P>------------------<BR>Hobbletoe Clubfoot - 27th Level Cleric<BR>Elrohir<BR>Elladan<BR>Tuvor<P>Erollisi Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000047.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=Quests/Items&TopicSubject=Still+thinking+about+the+quest+armor">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I haven't taken the time to check all the spells to see what their effects are but I wonder if we are overlooking something? What is each class' comparable AC when they buff themselves? For instance, if you have all level 29 players, one of each class, who has to make a run through somewhere semi-nasty, solo, what is each's AC after they have buffed themselves with their available spells? (I am thinking of my level 25 cleric having to go through High Pass or the Gorge to go between Freeport and Qeynos when none of my friends are on or nearby to help.)It seems to me the cleric ends up with the best AC plus they have the saves against poison, cold, etc. that the armor provides. I know there are better items for me but I still prefer my necklace of undead protection and my rat shaped ring over other things I could wear in those slots. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000047.cgi&ReplyNum=000013&forum=Quests/Items&TopicSubject=Still+thinking+about+the+quest+armor">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are CT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000047&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000047&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
