I am not sure, are you a monkey or a human??<p>You have got to be, in all honesty, the dumbest person that has ever posted on any post I have read.  I have seen monkeys on the Learning channel, perform more acts of intelligence than you.  They can even speak (in sign language) in full sentences.  They got one up on you Korral.  I just hope you have the excuse of youth to back you up.  You are the most pathetic person to ever open his mouth!  Geez.  You seriously need to do perform the act of evolution.  Oops, damn.  I think I lost him on the first sentence.<br>
