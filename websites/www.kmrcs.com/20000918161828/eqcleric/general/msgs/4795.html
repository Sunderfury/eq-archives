Clerics to tend to think that they are so important to any group that you are nuts not to have one..<p>However, thru a good chunk of the game, they are nice, but not needed.  Clerics can not tank as their melee is bad.  Armor is nice, but lack of hp's is an issue.  Healing is matched by other classs and buffs are good, but other class can do similiar with differnt spells.<p>The worse part is when you run into clerics, they tend to not know their role as primary healer as they want to prove they are good at other things.. <p>That said, a cleric is nice, but at many levels, give me a shaman or druid.. Most parties are not at a full 6, so I need somebody that can do more then one thing<p><br>

: Clerics to tend to think that they are so important to any group that you are nuts not to have one..

: However, thru a good chunk of the game, they are nice, but not needed.  Clerics can not tank as their melee is bad.  Armor is nice, but lack of hp's is an issue.  Healing is matched by other classs and buffs are good, but other class can do similiar with differnt spells.

: The worse part is when you run into clerics, they tend to not know their role as primary healer as they want to prove they are good at other things.. 

: That said, a cleric is nice, but at many levels, give me a shaman or druid.. Most parties are not at a full 6, so I need somebody that can do more then one thing
