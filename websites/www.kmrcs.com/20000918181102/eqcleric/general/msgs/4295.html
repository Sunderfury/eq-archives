After that I tryed my rogue for a couple more days, then the cleric became my Primary charicter and havn't looked back.<p>As a point of note a friend stil plays his rogue. He was about 25th when I started playing my cleric properly. Im now 36 he's 37 (and he does know how to play a rouge).<p>This isn't ment to discourge you in the slightest they can be fun to play. Whatever race you choose put everyting into dex and adj. Id say max out dex becouse as a rogue you are there do do damage not take it, and missing all the time can be very painfull (especialy when your missing backstabs); but on the other hand getting hit as a rogue is not a fun experiance.<p>Good luck ;)
