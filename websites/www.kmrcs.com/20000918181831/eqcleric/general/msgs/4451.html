My regular group consists of a tank, an enchanter, and a cleric.  We add others as we go.  When we find a group that understands the role of the enchanter, we are almost invincible.

If a stray MoB attacks the wizzie, I MAY melee it off, if I can, until it can be taunted off or  the enchanter enthralls it.  If I start getting pounded after throwing out a greater heal to an ailing tank, I don't even bother to melee (no point , MoBs laugh at my puny efforts), I just wait for the enchanter to mez it.  Wrath is way too expensive a spell to use at the expense of healing, especially when there's a wizzie on board.    If your group doesn't understand your role, then lose the group.  I'm sure they can find a misguided cleric somewhere who will be happy to wrath and tank for them, and they can all die together.<p>: Elyssa Brigantia<br>: 35th Cleric<br>: Bristlebane<p>
