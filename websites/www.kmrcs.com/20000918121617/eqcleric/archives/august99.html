        <p>It used to be after casting a res spell that you could cancel the
        spell effects by using Reckless Strength.&nbsp; That does not appear to
        work anymore.&nbsp; Three times I got the message &quot;Your spell did
        not take hold.&quot;&nbsp; Ok, call me stubborn.&nbsp; But look at the
        bright side: Rangers got Critical Hits with bows.&nbsp; Woo hoo!&nbsp;
        (ed. the group I regularly play with has two rangers so yes, I am happy
        for them).&nbsp; Was a stupid med key too much to ask for?</p>

        <ul>
          <li>I have recently received many updates to the Cazic Thule guide
            written by Mikaela many weeks ago.&nbsp; Those have now been
            incorporated into her original document.&nbsp; Thank you Fuenyan,
            Unbeliever, Tracy, and Tristan.</li>
          <li>I have updated the spells through level 29.&nbsp; Hopefully I will
            have time during my lunch hour tomorrow to finish the spell
            chart.&nbsp; Also, I'm still looking for hard numbers of some of the
            spells (e.g. Symbol of Transal, Ryltan, others that have varying
            effects dependent upon level).</li>
          <li>I hope to install a new message board this weekend.&nbsp; I also
            hope to setup a periodic system to archive&nbsp; the messages on a
            regular basis.&nbsp; I apologize for the size of the current board
            and do plan on addressing it soon.</li>
          <li>I saw a request to create a trading board on this site.&nbsp; I'm not inclined to do it
            only because of what appears to be the dismal failure of other sites
            dedicated to that (http://www.EQTrade.com comes to mind).&nbsp; If
            there is really a demand e-mail me or post on the board.&nbsp; I
            personally would love to have a good site to go visit.&nbsp; If
            there is already an excellent site which has a lot of traffic please
            let me know and I'll add a link.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>On a personal note I hit 29 last night and did my first revive
            (woo-hoo).&nbsp; I kept asking for volunteers in my party, but for
            some reason nobody would.&nbsp; They are so selfish :P.</li>

        clicked submit.&nbsp; Just for kicks I checked out a few message boards
        and saw the same dichotomy; one player, a rogue, felt that it was
        worthless because I included the med key request.&nbsp; Another
        responded to him and felt that issue was worthwhile (along with a number
        of other points).&nbsp; On this board a wizard thought everything was
        fine except for Undead burns (he didn't pick on Retribution).&nbsp; A
        magician didn't like our encroachment of bandages, but had no problems
        with the rest.&nbsp; A druid felt that the whole thing was
        pointless.&nbsp; You pick any topic on the list and I'll find you a
        minimum of two opinions.&nbsp; I have no idea if I properly picked the
        majority opinion on each item in the list; I thought I did at the time

      <blockquote>
        <p>I'm very happy to see all the discussion concerning the
        petition.&nbsp; Between the message board, private e-mails directly to
        me (which are always welcome) and the EQ Cleric e-mail list the ideas
        are flying hot and heavy.&nbsp; In the meantime, between work, reading
        and responding to the different posts and trying to get my poor
        character a new item I haven't had time to work on anything new.&nbsp;
        Once the petition is done I'll put some new changes and additions into
        place.</p>
        <p>While I'm on the topic of the petition I would like to state that it
        is extremely unlikely that everyone will be happy with everything on the
        petition.&nbsp; I expect it would be a true statement that it's doubtful
        that <i>anyone</i> will be happy with everything on it.&nbsp; The
        question you should ask yourself is: &quot;Can I support everything on
        this even though some of the items are unimportant or that I disagree
        (mildly) with?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The biggest disagreement is over high-level DD damage.&nbsp; Look,
        we're talking about 10%.&nbsp; In my opinion neither side should have a
        problem with this issue.&nbsp; If it wasn't on the list um, it's
        10%.&nbsp; If we don't get a new spell at 49, well, how bad is that
        really? Lots of clerics are hitting 50 in spite of that lack so things
        can't be that bad.&nbsp; For those of you who are against it, hey, can't
        you support this increase?&nbsp; The vast majority of high-level clerics
        feel that a lot more than a mere restoration is in order, so is it such
        a hard thing for you to support their getting a piddling 10% back?&nbsp;
        For the record I'd prefer to leave it on because the majority of
        high-level clerics are in favor of it.&nbsp; Until I've fought their
        mobs I'd prefer to reserve judgement so I'll support theirs.</p>
        <p>The name of this game is compromise.&nbsp; You want Summoned Bandages
        at level 5?&nbsp; Then support your level 44 brothers on their damage
        spells.&nbsp; Nobody is going to be happy with everything on the
        petition, including myself.&nbsp; However, I will promise that every
        item will be carefully thought out and presented in a reasonable manner
        as befitting our class. You may not agree with it, but you will not be
        embarrassed to support it.</p>
        <p>I never intended to make this an editorial, but it came pouring out
        once I started writing it.&nbsp; Please let me know what you think, but
        better yet, post it on the board so that all may comment.</p>

            we are the equal of any class when casting on undead mobs.&nbsp; (<b>Note:</b>
            If I'm off target on this one please let me know.&nbsp; We should be

            little better, but that's another issue).</li>
          <li>Review our high level DD spells.&nbsp; If upping the damage on
            Retribution isn't a possibility can we have a new spell at level 49?</li>
          <li>Review the higher level hammer spells (the level 9 spell is fine)
            for potential upgrades.&nbsp; They are currently less than useful.</li>
          <li>Add a meditation key or make meditation automatically kick in when
            opening the spell book.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I will be reviewing old e-mails and this message board for other
        excellent ideas that I may have missed.&nbsp; Please post any thoughts
        you have to the board; I do review it on a regular basis.</p>

        <p>I posted a message on the board requesting links to petitions from
        some of the other classes.&nbsp; If anyone has a URL I'd appreciate
        it.&nbsp; I want to see how some of the other petitions were designed.</p>
