: So, I've been on Kerra Isle for 17 hours now. I've been taking turns with other clerics and druids on Mitty's spawn. I've personally killed Mitty 26-30 times? I've lost count.<p>: During this agonizing camp, I have not, nor have any other players looted the gold ring from Mitty. SHE HAS NOT DROPPED IT ONCE! One of the players petitioned a GM. The GM said the spawn was working. A druid I have come to know well during the camp has said he has killed Mitty around 50 times and has not looted the gold ring.<p>: Is this what camping an item for a Quest is all about? Is this what Verant intended? I've heard horror story after horror story from other players about quests. Now I have my own. I am very discouraged to do any more quests. Hopefully this is an isolated incident, although I assume most of you have horror stories of your own. The only good thing about this quest was I got to meet some really nice clerics and druids while camping.<p>: I have currently given up on camping Mitty and the PAW quest. It is just not worth it to me to camp a mob for such a long time. <p>: Goss Vicar<br>: 29th Cleric<br>: Servant of BRELL SERILIS<br>: Karana server<p>Well...good luck, you'll need it.  My druid friend and I found this quest just as it came out publicly on sites like EQ'lizer and started camping immediately for the rings...well...3 weeks later and hundreds of Mitty deaths we finally had a pair of gold rings.  Its a ridiclously slow spawn.
