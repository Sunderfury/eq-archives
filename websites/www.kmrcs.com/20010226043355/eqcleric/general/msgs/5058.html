:: Ok, I would argue that if you want two of anything in a party, it would be tanks.  My regular group consists of a ranger, a warrior, an enchanter, a wizard, myself (a cleric, of course), and one other.  On several occasions we have grouped with another cleric.  In this situation our group was unstoppable.  Everyone loved it.<p>: Part of the reason why 2 clerics aren't good is because sometimes that spot is best served with a different class.  Just as an example, if you were in lets say a part of 3.  1 tank and 2 clerics or would you have 2 tanks and 1 cleric ?<p>Did you read my first sentance?  I would argue that a two cleric party is just as good as a two wizard party and better than two druids or two shamans.<p>: 2 high level clerics in an area like the undead side lower guk is a different story.  True we have good DD against undead, but the cleric has to play it right.  More often then naught I've seen a cleric open up with undead spells only to have the mob beat on him and the tanks unable to get it off him.<p>As wizards would be in the same trouble if they opened up blasting.  That's just a matter of playing your character well, not a clerical weakness.  Yes, two clerics is a viable option.  It's much better than having two enchanters or two bards.  I'm not trying to say that bards and enchanters are not effective, but that only one is needed in a group.  I hate going into higher level dungeons without an enchanter or a bard.  It's  not just because of clarity/manasong, but because they help manage mob groups.  Enchanters are especially good at this.<p><br>Lucretia Rialsq<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Bristlebane
