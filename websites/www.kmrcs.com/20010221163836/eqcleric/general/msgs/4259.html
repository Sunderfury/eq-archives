: I know how much Ice Comet does, seen it in action plenty of times :)

: This was the group I was with:
: 46 ranger
: 40 cleric
: 38 cleric
: 42 necro
: 40 warrior
: 44 cleric (me)

: I'm not saying that I could be a primary nuker, it just turned out that I could nuke some with the classes we had in the group.
