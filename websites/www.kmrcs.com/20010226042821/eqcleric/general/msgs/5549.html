: At this point I can imagine some people I saying:  "This guy again?!"  Sorry folks, I really do need help from those who have been there and done that :)<p>: Ok, I was in Black Burrow (I'm a Lvl 6 Cleric) and I've been attacking Gnolls who con BLUE to me like I've been advised to when going solo.  I killed about 15 to 20 last night before checking my Exp bar and I gained HALF a bubble.  I dunno about you but if enemies who con blue are who a Lvl 5 guy is supposed to kill for experience I think something is wrong here.  <p>: Killing 20 for half a bubble?  That takes forever!  You have to remember that at Lvl 6 I CANNOT meditate so I must WAIT for my mana to regenerate, have access to at best, lvl 5 spells and have to compete with higher levels for the same Gnolls who just want some quick cash.  <p>: I figure it HAS to ME that's doing something wrong here.  What am I screwing up?  Any advice is welcome and remember, I am trying to make it to Lvl 9 here.  This is more or less short-term goals, not long term as in 20's or higher.  :)<p>
