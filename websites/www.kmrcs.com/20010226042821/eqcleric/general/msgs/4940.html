Myself personally, am the kind of person that likes to advance steadily.  I don't care if I have to stay in the same area killing stuff over and over and over and over and then over some more to get xp.  If I can do it fairly safely and get xp from it, I will stay there and do it.  I stayed in Oasis killing deepwater crocs and caimens and the occasional dry bone skels till I hit 24.  Granted I didn't spend all my time there, just went I felt like soloing.  If I'm up for the group situation, I will generally group with others in Highhold keep.  I generally don't have any problems finding a group there.  Sometimes you do have to stand around for a little bit to find a group, but not so long that you sit around twiddling your thumbs.  I too have not gone back to unrest since my 4 day stint there.  I think out of the 4 days I spent there, I only survived 1 day without dying more than 1x.  Maybe it was just me or maybe I had a bad group, but I didn't like that place a whole lot.  As far as Mistmoore Castle goes, haven't been there and I have heard it is another unrest to a bigger degree.  I attempted to do the hermit in south karana a few times but found that he was much too difficult to solo.  I grouped a little bit and we were able to do the aviak herriers & avocets in the aviak village (fairly good xp and loot there).  Haven't wandered south to the Rathe Mountains yet - although I have heard the aviak guards are good xp and loot (even if they are camped).  So basically what i'm saying is if you are like me and aren't really concerned with how fast you move up, just that you move up, Oasis can be a nice place to level.  Just beware of the spectres & the sand giants and you will do find.  As a side note, when medding up after a fight, find a nice water pillar (there are a couple of them) and go sit on the pillar behind it and you shouldn't have any problems with the specs or the sand giants.  I have NEVER died when sitting behind the pillars.  If you sit on the dock or the beach, your chance of dying to one of the 2 goes up about 200%.  <p><p>: <br>: Any tips on where you've been hunting lately and if<br>: getting exp to 24th came easily or was difficult?<p>: I'm currently making the push from 23 to 24 in OOT<br>: fighting Gargoyles.
