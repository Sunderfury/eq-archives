Don't ask me, but the fact that a higher level has it, doesn't necessarily mean its better, some of it is even just a status thing, a level 20 cleric has a screaming mace, so a lot of level 30's would rather upgrade to something harder to get, rather than better to use, just for the status (My ONLY explanation for a cleric wearing a rubicite helm)  You also have to keep in mind the powerlevelers, who don't upgrade ANY equipment until they're level 49-50, i personally know a lev 47 druid who uses a screaming mace, leather leggings, and a darkwood shield (no real benefit to him using any of them, and a LOT of better items, he'd just rather make level 50, then go camp for everything)<p>Just my .02<br>Khalim Richelieu<br>Innoruuk
