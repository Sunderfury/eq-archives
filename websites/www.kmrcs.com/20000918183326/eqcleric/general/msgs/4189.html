Yes, I am a dwarf with str of 100. No need for the bag.<p>: You could keep it :)  But I'm trying to get all the weight reduction I can!<p>: If you do end up selling it, I'd go for the Borxx lens (if you can get it) or a couple of gold jasper earrings (player made).  At your level the mana from the Observer Staff will be much better than the mana bonus from wisdom.  That will change.  You could also go for some lizardscale armor (mantle and/or cloak) which are pretty cheap on most servers, then toss in some jewelry.<p>: You still have a few levels before you can go to unrest to hunt the Knight for the BS mantle and tunic or the preacher in perma (for the runed circlet).  At this point in your career, I'd say armor or the staff.  If you do have enough strenght to wear full bronze, you will probably find out pretty quick that you'll need another bad to hold your loot (unless you're a dorf with over 100 str hehe).<p>
