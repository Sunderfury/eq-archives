: I am currently lvling rather quickly by hunting the Qeynos aquaduct sharks (2 in a tank with fair spawn rates of about 10-15 minutes) when I finally decided to give Rooting the shark a try.  I mean, why not?  If it works I can Smite it to death with no risk.  If it fails as it should (no feet to Root) I simply would have to bash it to death.  SOSO<p>: I cast Root & the message came back "The Shark's feet adhere to the floor".  In all the college courses I have ever taken I never knew Sharks have feet.  EQ teaches you something new every day.  hehehe<p><br>
