: The quest armor is there to replace Rubi.  A lot of classes (rangers, shaman) are VERY happy about the new armor.

: Clerics also have an armor to replace Rubi.  Wear it if you want - nothing was taken away from us by taking away Rubi.

: Now, should the new armor replace all the nice +WIS stuff we have been accumulating?  I'm not sure about that.  Rubi did not fill that function...

: The new quest armor seems less valuable to clerics than to the other classes.  But, so was Rubi...

: Just some thoughts.
