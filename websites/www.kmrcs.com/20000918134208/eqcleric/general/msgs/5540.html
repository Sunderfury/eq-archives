: I posted the same question on Japanese BBS and got the following answer.

: There are two kinds of potion you get in exchange of Honey Jum. One is &quot;Potion Disease Ward&quot; and the other is &quot;Ochre Potion Disease Ward&quot; (you can find this out by wizard's Identify Item spell). If you give Lempeck an &quot;Ochre Potion Disease Ward&quot;, you'll get attacked.

: The potion is No Drop, so it's impossible for me to know if it's the right one or not (though I also heard that there is a weight difference between those two), so it's pure luck for me.
