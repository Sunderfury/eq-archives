I hunted Reavers by day and Undead Reavers by night in East Karana (the zone just outside HH, down the LONG ramp.)  I got to level 21 by soloing them and after that theres Lake Rathetear and there is some GREAT stuff there =)  You can get to level 22 hunting reavers but only the Undead ones will still give you exp at level 21 so it would be slow.  Just be careful when you pull a Reaver/Undead reaver, there are war wolves and Spirit stalkers that will attack you if you pull a reaver near them (Believe me, They run FAST.  I nearly died cause i got some on me and I couldn't out run them to safety.)  I hope this helps a little and gives you some more options =) <p>Ziggi,<br>Healer of Tunare,<br>Veeshan
