I have seen or been the target of some fairly shabby GM actions myself, including watching GMs kill players with ep loss for disagreeing with them in a roleplaying situation, and in a GM run event on Rallos Zek, watch a GM kill a player and loot them.  The loot taken was a mask of the deceiver (no drop) and several pieces of platinum jewelry.<p>One of my biggest griefs with the whole Verant system is that there is no way to give feedback to whomever is in charge.  I realize that they would be swamped by whining on a daily basis, but still the fact remains that true issues of service and such do need to be addressed, such as their completely infuriating and apparently helpless accounting staff.
