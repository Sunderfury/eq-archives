: I no longer do any direct damage to a mob someone else has, no matter how dire the circumstances, unless directly asked by that person. The reason? My experience was that more than half of the time one of two bad things would happen; either I would get the rude type of response you describe or the situation would suddenly become worse (i.e. something else spawns or shows up) and the person I was helping is obviously no help becuase he couldn't even handle the original mob - so I end up dying or zoning.<p>: I will throw heals and/or buffs if I feel the situation warrants, but never direct help against the mob.<p>: <br>: BTW, you should have just lied and told him you were OOM and couldn't heal. Then he would've left you alone.<p><br>
