<br>Well I am only level 21 so I'm not exactly that experiencied but I fought in high hold until level 20 (mainly the orcs, but sometimes I would fight gnolls).  However if you want to travel there is the gorge (beholder's maze) where you can get mino axes and runnyeye is right next door where the elite goblin (or gnoll?) guards are level 20+.<p>Good luck!<p>--Vinlaen of Rallos Zek (level 21)<p>: Ok I just reached 18. Yay! The orcs and gnolls in HH are not that great for xp at they were at 17. So, I need a few hunting areas near HH to visit to rack in xp and loot. I prefer a group, but I can solo as well.<p>
