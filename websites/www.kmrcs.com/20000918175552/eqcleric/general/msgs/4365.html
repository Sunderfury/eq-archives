The BEM is the same damage but with a lot less delay (and no yup effect), 8 - 27 I think.

However equipment wise I dont think that anyone would be intrested in those items at the level it can be camped and would either trade for somthng of similar level or just sell for plat.<p>Personaly id buy things in this order spells, +wis items, armour, weapon. Melee can be fun on occation but I rearly do much than neecap a few mobs to keep by skill up.
