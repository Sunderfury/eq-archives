: Some people take this topic too seriously...

: I would like everyone to consider this idea that
: the cleric, alone among all other classes, has
: some kind of &quot;duty&quot; to everyone else in the game.
: I don't know about anyone else, but I find this
: to be the most laughable, contemptible idea that
: anyone has ever put to me.

: This game is based upon social interaction, and,
: society being what it is, that means that just
: about everything in this game is driven by two
: simple questions:

: 1) What do you have that I want?
: 2) What do I have that you want?

: The fact that there is an economy built into the
: game bears this fact out, but it is also present
: in simple player-player interactions without
: considering trade of money or items.  For example
: a cleric and warrior group together.  Why is this?
: The cleric asks, what does the warrior have that I
: want?  The warrior has the ability to melee in a
: MUCH better capacity than the cleric, which means
: that fighting battles becomes easier for the cleric,
: hence advancing in the game becomes easier.  What
: does the cleric have that the warrior wants?  The
: cleric can heal, buff, and cast other spells that
: make the warrior's downtime shorter, and in general
: makes it easier for the warrior to carry out his
: role.  Together, they share in the profits (XP and
: loot), and are more efficient than if they worked
: solo.

: If you insist on imposing a &quot;duty&quot; on a cleric to
: heal, buff or resurrect without expectation of
: compensation, I submit then, that:

: * Warriors should kill everything in sight of any
: other player, then give that player all the money
: and loot from those mobs.  It is their &quot;duty&quot; to
: slay monsters and expect nothing from it beyond the
: joy of battle.  After all, THEY would be getting
: all the experience.  How selfish of them.

: * Druids and Shamans should always buff and SoW
: everyone they see, especially if they ask for it,
: but as long as they're not in immediate danger
: they should forsake all other activity to do their
: &quot;duty&quot; and render these services for others.

: * Trade skill products should always be given
: away at the maker's expense in time and materials.
: It is your duty to give these things away, because
: without someone to demand them from you, you would
: have no reason to make them.

: * Likewise, all binds, buffs, teleports, and other
: beneficial spell effects should be given freely
: and immediately upon demand, because it is your
: &quot;duty&quot; to ensure that others benefit from your
: hard-earned skills and abilities.

: Does anyone see a pattern of idiocy here?  Of
: COURSE no one will conform to these rules.  Why
: on EARTH should anyone expect a cleric to behave
: differently?

: My hat goes off to those clerics that sacrifice
: their time and efforts to help others without
: asking for or expecting payment of some kind.  I
: myself have spent much time offering free healing,
: buffs and other spells, but it was because I FELT
: LIKE IT.  The minute someone tries to tell me I
: have a &quot;duty&quot; to do it is the instant I'm off to
: do other things.  No one would stand on the corner
: and give out their money, much less have people
: tell you &quot;it's about time, you cheapskate&quot; while
: you do it.  That's the same thing that clerics
: are having to put up with.

: Servant of Underfoor
: Deacon of the 15th Hammer
: Tarew Marr

: : I dont normally charge to do a ress/revive.
: : I did discover that being in CT was very profitable to me when I did do the ress/revive. 
: : Several people are more then willing to donate to the cause, but  let them offer it.
: : As a cleric it is our duty to ress, but you have the choice to turn them down. If you are camping something & your group needs you that is one thing but if you have the mana & the group is just waiting.. then why not do a ress????
