"Personally I think GZ has a real thing for enchanters and guards them jealously.

The reason you see them get so many changes is because enchanter spells are more complicated.  Maybee GZ likes us enchanters a tad more, but hell....we *are* the coolest =P.  Anyway, back to charm.  Druid befriend animal.  I agree, why in the HELL do they immediately go aggro on the druid after it drops?  Charming is forcing something (against its will) to do your bidding.  Seems to me, a druid befriending an animal should be different.  But how do you change it?  Cant let it go for duration of the time in a zone, because a druid with an everlasting griffin pet would be a *tad* unbalancing (dont say enchanters can have one..trust me griff charms are tough to keep...and i *did* learn that the hard way).  Maybee leave it with a random duration, but not let it add to aggro list in any way.  Would be cool with me, seems like it should be that way, if you "befriend" something.<p>Necro's losing charm.  Hmmm...they had charm?  Didnt know that.  I know they got charm undead...sure hope you arent saying they lost it.  Hmmm....litches...vampires...they hold things under their "spell" dont they?  Ok, Ill buy necro's getting some kind of charm spell...but obviously it should pale in comparison to enchanter charm, as we make a living with it.<p>Shaman losing charm.  Ughh...i hope they arent bitching.  You guys can wear rubicite.  You guys have nice DoT's, Quickness/insects line for slowing/speeding, can HEAL, MELEE AND cast a pet (WTF???).  Shaman are just fine =).  (ok, alchemy needs to be fixed..I'll give you that)<p>As for clerics, well I always though a "guardian angel" pet would look kinda cool =P.<p>
