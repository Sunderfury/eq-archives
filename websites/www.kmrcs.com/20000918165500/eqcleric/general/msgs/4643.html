I would like to see how well a party of level 50's (any party make) with 1 shaman & 1 druid do in a big dungeon place.  I don't think they would live very long.  Granted they get greater heal - but the amount they will heal will be less than a cleric with greater heal.  Sure they (shamans) have great buffs and such, but they will spend all their time healing (until they attract the attention of the mob for healing too much) and then they won't be any good doing dot's or dd or anything like that.<p><p>: : Yeah sitting and medding all the time sucks at times...sorry healing and buffing is our job, everything else is secondary:<p>: Says it all..<br>: Clerics have the worst "downtime"  They sit, med, buff, heal repeat...  do nothing directly to the game..  pretend that warriors are their DOT's...<p>: Shamans/druids heal just as well for a good part of the game.. hell, just go with with one of each and they can cover for the cleric healing wise PLUS do things that keep the need for heals that much less (ie dot's debuffs, buffs etc)<p>

: : : Yeah sitting and medding all the time sucks at times...sorry healing and buffing is our job, everything else is secondary:

: : Says it all..
: : Clerics have the worst &quot;downtime&quot;  They sit, med, buff, heal repeat...  do nothing directly to the game..  pretend that warriors are their DOT's...

: : Shamans/druids heal just as well for a good part of the game.. hell, just go with with one of each and they can cover for the cleric healing wise PLUS do things that keep the need for heals that much less (ie dot's debuffs, buffs etc)
