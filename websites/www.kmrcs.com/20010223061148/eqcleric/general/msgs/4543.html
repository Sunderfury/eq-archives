: most people who plays warriors are totally mad about getting exp fast and when they team up with a cleric they just want them to heal them while they pull all the time. most of them don't realize that the reason why they can kill so much more than normally is because their HP's now is withing the cleric's mana. and they end up doing insane pulls as they think that they have killed this kind of pull before (with a cleric on full mana that is, but what do they know)...<p>: i dont think they realize how much those buffs means to them. at higher levels i would not let a tank pull anything before he's fully buffed. without buffs means more heals for you and much more often, which also leads to you getting jumped by mobs.<p>: another thing with warriors is that they HATE downtime. they don't see that mana bar go up when the rest of the team is medding, they just see that everyone in group is good on health so they want to pull. once again they forget all about that their hp's are probably not enough for most high level pulls, thats why they wait until they are both fully buffed and got a cleric with mana to heal them. it's always better to be safe than to be sorry......<p>: -Aappaak, 38 cleric.<p>Geeze, seems like all the clerics out there hate us warriors. Just so you know I had a cleric for a time also, so I understand your point of view, but not ALL warriors are morons like you are saying.<p>I for one always wait for any casters in the group to be full mana (or to the point that they say they are ready).<p>You don't gotta be THAT hard on us =)...although, I'm only 12th level at this point, so maybe we do get dumber as we gain levels.<p>-Azeroke, Warrior of the 12th Circle, Methanniel Marr (spelling, blah)
