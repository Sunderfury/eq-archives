Ok, I would argue that if you want two of anything in a party, it would be tanks.  My regular group consists of a ranger, a warrior, an enchanter, a wizard, myself (a cleric, of course), and one other.  On several occasions we have grouped with another cleric.  In this situation our group was unstoppable.  Everyone loved it.<p>I also happen to know that one of the most powerful level 50 parties on our server has two clerics.  Why is this?  With two clerics in your party, you can pretty much auto-pull.  If you're in an undead area like lower guk, any cleric level 44+ has terrific DD spells.  And by sharing the buffs, both clerics have more mana for healing.<p>I really wonder how you play your cleric.  Yes, if you don't like healing and buffing, you're out of place playing a cleric.  There is more finesse to playing a cleric, though, then you give them credit for.<p>Lucretia Rialsq<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Bristlebane<br>*am I posting too much?*<br>:)<p>
