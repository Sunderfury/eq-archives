            <BLOCKQUOTE>May I humbly suggest a few modifications to your 
              patching software? 
              <BLOCKQUOTE>1) If, for some reason, I do not completely download 
                one of the files and then disconnect (because your patch server 
                is overloaded), please do not make me re-download the same bytes 
                over and over again. A resume feature would be very nice and you 
                might even find that it would help REDUCE the load on your patch 
                server (when you put some damn gargantuan file out 
                there).<BR><BR>2) If, for some reason, I do not completely 
                download ALL of the files and then disconnect (because your damn 
                patch server is overloaded), PLEASE do not make me re-download 
                ALL of the same files again when I was at 90% for the 3rd time. 
                Instead, build in the capability for your patch software to 
                indeed remember that bmpwad3.s3d has already been fully 
                downloaded 4 times and really does not need to be downloaded 
                again. You might find that it would help REDUCE the load on your 
                patch server.<BR><BR>Having been a software designer for over 
                half of my life I fully understand the difficulties involved, 
                but I think it's time to revamp your patching system. When your 
                friends are getting eaten by a dragon and you are downloading 
                the same files for the 10th time (I patched 10 times before one 
                completed) it is frustrating. You are a good software company, 
                you can do this.</BLOCKQUOTE>Rayne<BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

            <BLOCKQUOTE>Was what we've been waiting for. I logged in a few 
              minutes ago and checked out the AC of the pieces of quest armor I

              Bracer (9), Boots (11), Gloves (12). I'll check out my BP tonight 
              when I reach a bank. This was exactly what they promised and what 
              we've been waiting to see. Here is the rest of the patch message:
              <BLOCKQUOTE>April 10th, 
                5:30am<BR>-------------------<BR><BR>***Patch Day***<BR><BR>The 
                following is a list of changes that were implemented on the Live 
                EverQuest servers today:<BR><BR>*Spells*<BR><BR>- You will now 
                receive a message when attempting to mesmerize a creature that 
                is immune to that type of spell.<BR>- You can now 
                right-click-and-hold on bard songs to determine what instrument 
                skill is used by the spell.<BR>- Dyn's Dizzying Draught has had 
                its casting time lowered significantly.<BR>- Corrected a bug in 
                the Druid root+damage spells (Enveloping roots series) that 
                caused the spell's damage to have a chance of breaking the 
                spell. They work much better now.<BR>- The Magicians Phantom 
                Armor series now grants HP regeneration.<BR>- The Druid spell, 
                dance of the fireflies, has been changed from "Outdoor only" to 
                "Night only". It may now be cast in dungeons.<BR>- Corrected a 
                typographical error that allowed high level magicians to 
                inscribe the Malosi spell. It was not intended for magicians 
                under level 50.<BR><BR><BR>*General Changes/Fixes*<BR><BR>- 
                Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity. If a 
                deity restriction is placed upon an item, it will show when you 
                right-click-and-hold on the item.<BR>- The AC on the mid-level 
                cleric quest armor has been increased.<BR>- The Terror Mask will 
                now cast "Fear" instead of "Call of Bones" as previously 
                announced. The "Call of Bones" effect was placed on this item by 
                mistake.<BR>- The Mempo of Likato now grants AC.<BR>- The Quest 
                for the Short Sword of Morin has been fixed.<BR>- Some 
                spawn-time problems in Mistmoore have been repaired.<BR>- Five 
                spawn-time problems were identified in regards to the Armor of 
                Ro (Paladin) quests. They have been fixed and Paladins should 
                have a much easier time of obtaining their armor.<BR>- Pets 
                should now attack Willowisps on command.<BR>- Many spell-gems 
                and icons have been changed to reflect the appropriate action of 
                the spell. Be sure to reacquaint yourself with your spell 
                line-up.<BR>- Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to 
                ignore the instrument in use.<BR><BR><BR>*Kerra 
                Ridge*<BR><BR>Kerra Ridge has been completely revamped. The 
                target level-range for the zone has been slightly increased. In 
                addition, many new quests have been added to the zone. The 
                faction for Kerrans has been changed so that those who killed 
                them indiscriminately before today's update can take part. Be 
                warned that the Kerrans still do not like 
                everyone.<BR><BR>*Paw*<BR><BR>Paw has received another minor 
                difficulty adjustment. In addition, item drop percentages have 
                been increased.<BR><BR>*The Plane of Hate*<BR><BR>The Plane of 
                Hate has received an item-drop/spawn-time revamp. Take care in 
                your exploration of this zone as many things have 
                changed.<BR><BR><BR>- The EverQuest Team</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

            <BLOCKQUOTE>May very well be a fake. I was quite aware of the

              worst item one could get from a GM. I noticed the stats up front, 
              but then again don't put anything past Verant. Some people there 
              believe in Battle Clerics.<BR><BR>Anyway, instead of spamming me, 
              please direct all your e-mails to dnyguenhyang@yahoo.com, who 
              claims to be Utachabi Innoui, server unknown. Seriously, I'm sure

            <BLOCKQUOTE>Having a really hard time discovering anything Cleric 
              related, but found this post from Gordo today:
              <BLOCKQUOTE>**some complaint about drop rates***<BR><B>Just 
                trying to verify your logic: The drop percentages in Hate are 
                low so people with armor in Hate will play longer? I suppose 
                that means that since the drops in Fear are higher, we must want 
                everyone with armor there to quit. <BR>Please... We have Hate

            <BLOCKQUOTE>Below is the complete patch:
              <BLOCKQUOTE>***TODAY'S PATCH***<BR><BR>This morning's update 
                consisted primarily of server-side changes to improve 
                performance of the game engine in general. No items, spawns, 
                spells (with the exceptions below), etc., were changed as a 
                result of this patch. <BR><BR>- Area Effect "Fear" spells will 
                no longer work in PvP. This affects a bard song, as well as the 
                Cleric "Wave of Fear" spell.<BR>- Corrected a bug with some of 
                the Resurrection spells that caused them to return too little 
                experience. <BR><BR>We plan on publishing data and item changes 
                next week if all goes well on the Test server. We apologize to 
                those who are inconvenienced by having to wait for the expected 
                changes.<BR><BR>-The EverQuest Team</BLOCKQUOTE>The issues with 
              the Resurrection line returning variable experience has been 
              documented for so long that it's been forgotten (or at least I 
              did). This was a welcome change. Too bad about the quest armor, 
              but at least they are officially making a committement for next 
              week.<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

            <BLOCKQUOTE>On the 9th of this month I posted a question on 
              Everquest's Gameplay Forum querying why the Warhammer of Divine 
              Grace did not possess stat modifiers when the other two priest 
              specific dragon drops both granted +9 Wisdom. Here is Abashi's 
              response:
              <BLOCKQUOTE><B>No one ever said that all items dropped by 
                creature X would be carbon-copies of each other for all classes 
                involved. This is true for Dragon Loot as well for common-drops. 
                The critters in Kithicor drop a pretty nifty cleric item as I 
                recall, and other classes aren't necessarily represented. That's 
                just the way it is. Balanced != 
              Identical<BR>-Gordon</B></BLOCKQUOTE>Here is the link to the <A 
              href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/024777.html">entire 
              thread</A>.<BR><BR>For the record, the Kithicor weapons are 
              typically usable by: War, Clr, Pal, Shd, Rng, Dru, Mnk, Bard, Rog, 
              Shm. At least the Ruined Battleworn Morning Star I grabbed from an 
              Undead Trooper is. Kind of a shame when I get a better item of a 
              run of the mill mid 30s mob in Kithicor than I could get from Lady 
              Vox.<BR><BR>As for when the quest armor will finally be upgraded 
              on the live servers, here's another "gem" from Gordo:
              <BLOCKQUOTE><B>Actually I admitted 3 patches ago that it looked 
                wrong and that we'd look into it. 2 patches ago I admited that 
                it was fixed on test and would go live the next time we patched 
                data. We haven't patched data since then.<BR><BR>We should be 
                patching data next week.<BR><BR>-Gordon</B></BLOCKQUOTE>Only

                didn't patch any data as part of this patch (npcs, drops, spawn 
                rates, items, etc.). I hope we can do data next week, but can't

              11:00am<BR>-------------------<BR>***UPDATE MESSAGE***<BR><BR>This 
              morning's update consisted primarily of server-side changes to 
              improve performance of the game engine in general. However, there 
              are several changes to note:<BR><BR>*Spell Changes*<BR><BR>- Skin 
              Like Nature has had its damage shield removed and has regained its 
              regeneration component. We're certain this time :)<BR>- Many 
              Shaman buff spells have had their recast delay removed. You can 
              now cast them on multiple people without having to wait between 
              each cast.<BR>- The Wizard spell "Rend" was improperly saving 
              versus cold. It now saves versus Magic. <BR><BR>*Bug Fixes and 
              General Enhancements*<BR><BR>The spawning problem in Solusek's Eye 
              (SoldungA), related to the spawn of the Clockwork gnomes, will be 
              fixed later today in a zone patch. <BR><BR>The +/= key will no 
              longer take screenshots. <BR><BR>You can now adjust your clipping 
              plane by using the SHIFT/- and SHIFT/+ key combinations. 
              <BR><BR>You can now view the Message of the Day by typing 
              /motd.<BR><BR>Corrected a bug in the /follow process that would 
              cause your character to loop around to the right at times when 
              following someone.<BR><BR>Corrected a bug that would cause 
              item-loss associated with trading a container marked LORE 
              Corrected some grouping bugs that had the potential to cause the 
              client to crash. <BR><BR>*Feign Death and Pets*<BR><BR>The Feign 
              Death spell will no longer wear off. This change had been made due 
              to an issue that was discovered that allowed Necromancers to solo 
              creatures while feigned and AFK. The change had some unintended 
              effects, as we discovered that there are a few cases where someone 
              could be legitimately feigned for a longer period. Instead of 
              having the spell wear off, any summoned pet will automatically 
              suicide 2 minutes after its owner feigns. This is the solution 
              requested by most of the players who voiced an opinion, and should 
              serve the same goal as the original change.<BR><BR>- The EverQuest

            <BLOCKQUOTE>Spent an evening doing respawns (wasn't SUPPOSED to be 
              respawns, but that's another issue entirely =P). The haul was:

                <LI>3 Warrior Whips (from the Amy's)<BR>
                <LI>2 Cryosilk Sleeves (from phobo's)<BR>

                <LI>Ranger Arms<BR></LI></UL>So I count 15 drops in the six hours 
              I was there. It is important to note that this was a haul of the 
              <B>respawns</B>, not a fully spawned zone. For example, we did not 
              see one Gorgon (or I missed her if she showed). There were very 
              few Fetid Fiends (3 of each gender).<BR><BR>I'm thrilled with the

              <BLOCKQUOTE>I created a dwarf cleric last night, and anytime 
                when I went into the city, there were 20 or so people doing the 
                Tumpy Tonic quest.. When I asked a few of them about it, they 
                said Verant did not change anything,and doing the quest still 
                ended up with major exp (1 full bub of exp for 100 Tonics) Note: 
                he said the exp was for turning in the Tonics, not making 
                them..<BR><BR>Verant, please fix that 
              quest.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><B>Abashi responds</B>:
              <BLOCKQUOTE>We investigated and modified the experience given 
                for the quest, and are fairly satisfied with it at this 
                point.<BR><BR>On a side note, of all the different 
                player-strategies in EQ, the one where people systematically 
                search out and employ the most boring way possible to play the 
                game is probably the most confusing to me.
