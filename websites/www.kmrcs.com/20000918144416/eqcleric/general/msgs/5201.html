: Well, gotta love verants love for tweaks.

: I printed out the quest info here earlier, and reviewed it.

: I was also able to recover the Reliant artifacts pretty quick on the server, and got the platinum bar that was listed on the post earlier.

: I figured i would check first to make sure, but with 15 ppl standing around talking to her, you cant really read squat...so i gave her the stuff, got the msg &quot;Wear this with pride!&quot; So i go YAY! and then stare at a empty inventory...
: By zoning out and scrolling back, i could see that our favorite company changed the enchanted bars requirement to 2 bars...so i figured that since i got a msg earlier that said &quot;Impressive, do you have the rest?&quot; i would be able to just turn in another bar, so i went and got one, got it enchanted...turned it in...but did i get my boots? Nopes...and am at the moment awaiting a gm / guide to get back to me.

: Just a tip...get the quest info, then zone out and read it...or you'll end up like me...i can already imagine what the reply i will get frmot he GM's will be.
