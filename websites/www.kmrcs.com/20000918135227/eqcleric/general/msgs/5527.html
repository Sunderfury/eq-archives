: I think EQ boots people off if they've been on for a while ON PURPOSE to allow other people access on to their servers.  I think they're over-crowded so they knock members off to allow other members on and call it "accidents."<p>Doubt that. I play evenings East Coast time, around 1400 folks on server, 1 disconnect about every 3 hours. Spouse plays early morning, about 500 folks on server, about same probability of disconnect. Multiple ISP's, no significant difference.<p>I have seen some hacker discussions which indicate that if the client-side item map (what you have on your computer) and the server-side item map (what is on Sony's computer) don't agree, you get booted as an anti-hack measure. It is possible that this defensive coding kicks in for lesser client/server mismatches, and loss of state synchronization is causing the booting. This fits with some people's observations concerning fewer boots with less equipment, and faster zoning when doing the naked cleric dance.<br>
