Thank you to everyone who has given me advice.  No, I don't know how to play a Cleric effectively--that much SHOULD be obvious!  If I really had any clue to what I was doing, I'd be higher than level six by now.<p>As to the guy who said I was putting down Clerics, screw you.  If I was putting down Clerics, would I come in here and ASK FOR ADVICE???  I'd insult you all, say how "great" whatever class I was and then leave.  Whoever you are who said I was insult Clerics, you're a freakin' moron and an insult to Clerics just by BEING here!<p>
