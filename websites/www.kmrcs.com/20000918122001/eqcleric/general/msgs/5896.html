The quest may be a hoax.  I did some research on "The Bracer of Keeras" since it has great stats, but no one had any clue despite different methods.  It is possible that someone knew of a real quest and was muddying the waters though.  The method seems to be to kill the scarabs of one type to gain faction with the other's sphinx.  The sphinxes may speak a different language, hard to tell if people were posting false information.  I haven't seen the Bracer auctioned or being traded though, so I think it just hasn't been implemented yet.<p>The Harpoon starts in Erudin.  Unfortuneately, Clerics can no longer use this weapon.  One dark elf Cleric was giving a Rant about it on the EQ Official Board, his web site is "Pixelated" something or other.
