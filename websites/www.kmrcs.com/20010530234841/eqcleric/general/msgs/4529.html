They recently changed the Ethereal Mist armor in PoF so that Dark Elves can use it, but they still left out Halflings. It has HEF on it instead of HFL, when Half Elves can't even be clerics.<br>But since you are on test there is no way you'll ever be able to get it since PoF requires at least 24 people that have extensive knowledge on how to enter and hold PoF.<br>
