Still seems to be 6-9 hr spawn times. Today I logged in to my Rogue who I have situated in Guk near the spawn point to check on it. I checked the water pillar and viola! There it was (going to collect it again even tho the quest is broken for now). So I log onto my Cleric in Lavastorm and run down there. Takes me 15-20 min or so I guess. I get there and some Wizard says, "hey did you need an ingot? i just accidentally picked it up". <p>Well I was civil, but of course in the back of my mind I would have liked to mutilate him. But then again, it's just a bag sitting on the ground, it could have been for his Wizard quest. Anyway he was nice enough, so we tried having him zone out, then destroy the Ingot he'd picked up. I even checked on it repeatedly for about an hour before I had to accept it was still on a 6 hr spawn time.<p>Judging by the fact that it took then 10 weeks to add Gnomes and Dark Elves to the Ethereal Mist Armor description, then another 2-3 weeks to add halfLINGS instead of Half-ELFs to the same equip, I would say it's going to be a while before the fix (yes, FIX - there is no other way to describe these quests so far other than broken) the spawn times on Ingots and Icons.<p>Anyone else ready for a new ORPG? Oh yeah ... no alternatives (UO and AC both suck and you know it).<br>
