I've seen that before!  I wish I could bring my little, level 5, enchantress to follow you around for a week or two- just to get some tips.  <p>A group of people I know decided to do a team PVP at the arena one day (other group took Fire Giants & Efreeti about 2 hours before- so we were waiting for them to respawn).  An enchanter friend of mine and a monk decided we'd challenge and group of 5 or less.  We won every one until another enchanter showed up, after the first loss (we won the first one) I had Resist Magic buffed (hate to see me healing others like the charmed whelp I was) and Nullify Magic in my spells at all times (hated to see out monk charmed interupting our enchanter and beating the heck out of her).  Almost every group that wanted to take us, immediately targetting me (completely forgot the enchanter).  Repeat or spectator groups would target the enchanter, then I'd stun (depending on group we were fighting), until she could get a AOE stun off.<p>Fun stuff
