1/ ROBERT KIRK: THE MAGICIAN <br>Robert Kirk, author of the Secret Commonwealth of Faerie circa 1610. Robert John Stewart's "Robert Kirk Walker between the Worlds" available for free download from Stewarts@Dreampower.com.<br>When my inquisitors spoke of Robert I recited my crude "Bob down and suck on  this" joke we liked to use about my brother in law, Robert. When they spoke about Kirk I thought they were talking about Captain Kirk of the Enterprise so the charade accelerated because they thought I was talking about Robert Kirk. So when they said he was really out there I was quite enthusiastic about the idea and not till later did I learn that they were implying that a 17th century Priest was still alive in Faerieland.<p>2/ THE RIDDLE OF 3, 4 AND 6: THE  PRIESTESS<br>The answer to the riddle is the 5th line from the poem found in Robert Grave's book "The White Goddess". <br>The answer to the riddle is the Goddess; not Enoch or Kai. The question the riddle asks is 'who was with my lord in the highest sphere'? Taken from the riddle of Taliesin written by the 6th century bard, the historical Taliesin. Lines 3 through to 6 of the poem sum up the whole God as the fallen Lucifer concept recurrent throughout the mysteries.<br>"Indo and Heinin called me Merddin                                                                                                         At length every king will call me Taliesin                                                                                                 I was with my Lord in the highest sphere                                                                                                   On the fall of Lucifer into the depth of hell"  <p>3/ THE EMPRESS: ARIADNE <br>Ariadne as the weaver goddess acts as time keeper of the universe.<p>4/ THE EMPEROR: ARACHNE             <br>At the right time Ariadne cocoons the Fisher King so the Emperor remains safe through the long night of the soul, the galactic winter. The eight legs of the spider symbolise the 8 divisions of the annual solar clock and of course spiders make the best fisherman. The spider was Robert the Bruce's companion when he was in the cave. Arachne, the mythical 13th sign of the zodiac was another weaver goddess; who Athena turned into a spider when she was found hanging after losing a boastful bet with Athena.<p>5/ THE PEARL: THE HIEROPHANT               <br>The pearl as the motif for wisdom and the alchemical Great Work transmits the idea that life can be cultured forth from the freezer as in invitro fertilisation. The oyster is its ark. The hierophant possesses the key of King Solomon. The Pope symbolises esoteric secrets handed down through the ages. Let us now take advantage of this period of religious freedom and remember that secrets are only necessary when you are in fear of reprimand. To hear of people swearing oaths to keep secret about esoteric doctrine is absolutely ludicrous in this day and age when it is all in legally available books anyway. Essentially secrets block the way of Truth and any Truth that has been made a secret festers, rots and eventually becomes only a shadow of itself. "I swear not to keep secret" has always been the earnest Cabalist's credo.                             <p>6/ THE VEIL OF ISIS: THE LOVERS              <br>The veil of Isis is a lace work of salt from the tears cried by people who have opened Janus' door and gazed upon nothing. They have lost their greatest love and they are alone. Path workers of the Cabala know Janus as Saturn who patrols between Yesod and Tiphareth. The veil of Isis is pierced to allow travel through the desert of the abyss, the path between Tiphareth, (Daath) and Kether. When I began to see the mists of Isis I shut my eyes and demanded that I was not interested in seeing any "spooky stuff". For the remainder of the time I kept my eyes shut which stopped me from hallucinating.<p>7/ JANUS AND ANNA PERENNA: THE CHARIOT           <br>Janus symbolises the reality gate between conscious and subconscious. When the, would be, tormentors told me to open the door I refused and told them to open their own door. The two faces of Anna Perenna are the future and the past. In her duel aspect she is both maiden and crone and always mother. Carina the constellation of the Keel which houses the keyhole nebula and the star Carinae, whom is the Goddess on which the door of Janus is hinged, was part of the dismantled constellation Argo Navis the ship of the Argonauts. Carinae is also one of the stars that makes up the false cross. <p>8/ AND 11/ THE ROOT AND THE BRANCH: STRENGTH AND JUSTICE                    <br>The Tree of Life glyph may be a  two dimensional diagram of a molecular structure. When mankind can decode the glyph he may be able to reproduce life. It is also a metaphysical star map pointing the way home for man's consciousness for when we have evolved enough to make the journey. The Tree of Life, the Christmas tree and the tree growing into Faerie land symbolise the Earth's axis. The myths associated with the zodiac are mans attempt to predict a future time frame, mythology or the 'word' constraining mans development through preordination. The wheel has been lashed, man tied to the mast and the course set in a cyclic motion. All solar myths are nailed on to the Masonic azimuth poles in the shape of a cross preventing any deviation from mans destination. In the interim the tree grows deeper and deeper into faerie land, mans collective unconscious.<p>When I was asked if I knew what the glyph was I responded "darned if I know" but then quoted the theory that it might be a representation of a strand of DNA. At this point I had the thought that the glyph is so beyond my comprehension that putting it into words would only be erroneous. After a brief investigation of the Indian Chakra system I am inclined to think the Tree of Life is simply the Jewish version of the Chakra system. Imaging the ten Sephirah as Chakras and the 7 main Chakras as Sephirah has provided a clarity and simplicity which resounds with a logic I find appealing.<br>    <br>9/ THE URN: THE HERMIT       <br>Some Astrologers believe that the rise and fall of a race of mankind is timed to a Galactic seasonal clock. The time interval from rise to fall is a multiplication of the celestial microcosmic clock of our own zodiac. On a macrocosmic scale one turn of the zodiacal clock depicts the celestial seasonal year of Earth from completely frozen and uninhabitable to lush and life producing and back to ice age again. Capricorn of the celestial year is the long night of the soul, the Galactic winter. Its polar opposite, Cancer is the life ripening mother of summer. The genetic racial memories of humankind have allowed him to be born with an in built evolutionary clock warning system. We make up stories in response to racial memories. The Hermit is the repository of all Hermetic knowledge. He is the seed of the Cabala that has been sown into the fabric of man's unconscious. The seed is the genetic characteristics installed in our DNA that enable successful evolution.<p>10/ SOPHIA MUNDI: THE ROTA<br>Mundi is none of your business. When I said that I was actually referring to my two dead cats who were called Barra and Mundi after the fish Barramundi. Mundi was lost off the boat earlier that year and Barra was shot the year before and to this day I am sensitive about losing those cats. I suppose my inquisitors thought I was being secretive about the Gnostic and Templar association with the God's wife principle that I read about after my trial. The wheel of fortune contains the Tarot that is the key to the magical Cabala. The mathematical formulae contained within the Tarot pack is beyond my comprehension but in times of stress I find myself able to talk to myself using the cards as archetypal thought props. At the end of the day, no matter how symbolic or metaphysically insightful you find the Tarot, the fortune telling aspects are just a card game. <p>During my ordeal I was tricked into believing that I was being psychically opened up by these people and that at each stage I was "communing at a higher level" until I had reached the spirit realm. Even though my disbelief was suspended and I was psychologically defenceless and completely vulnerable to these people I was able to retain my integrity and not be lead into the insidious "come again Christ" trip that they were pushing me so hard toward. I love Christ and it was only my knowledge of the Tarot and my liking of Crowley that saved me from being sucked into such a cruel heart breaking Trick as to make me believe that Christ had returned.<p>I wrote the Tarot comparison page as a way of describing my psychological journey into what I believe to be the realm of insanity. One of the complaints I made to these people was that they were using the Cabala which is a Jewish esoteric system and certainly not intended for any Neo-Nazi police force. The next strong impression I received was that they had extended the Cabala and were actually inverting it which is a standard practice of black magic "to reverse or reflect" what is good. I felt they had, by interfering with the Cabala, opened up a can of worms that they had not the depth of imagination to perceive. Later I had my suspicions confirmed when I saw a Tree of Life Glyph in Stewart's book with three corrupted sephirah extended passed Malkuth in a straight line into what Stewart thought as of Faerie land. What a hideous place to anchor a meditation system, in the human subconscious, which we know has the potential to be as mad as a Hatter's Tea Party. When I read about the mythical aspects of the 17th century Priest and Author Robert Kirk who was lost in Faerieland I felt great empathy for this archetypal explorer of the dark human subconscious.<p>11/ AND 8/ THE BRANCH AND THE ROOT: JUSTICE AND STRENGTH<br>So out of bad comes good, maybe by interfering with the Cabala, the New Age movement has furnished our generation with a root system to the tree of life. My concern was to show a straight path out of the insanity for people like myself who have been psychologically dunked. As I have already mentioned, I do not practice the occult I simply study. The authors of the Cabala were not able to stop the degeneration of a meditational system, that enables you to contemplate God and your own existence, into a parlour trick for power seekers. So I believe it to be 'fait accompli' that is what the Cabala has become, a powerful "magical" device. Magical power is such a big hook for our younger generation that I think it is important to make this system psychologically kid proof before the nasty people out there get the chance to flush a generation of the most clairvoyant kids ever down the toilets of their back alley secret societies. The combination of evil intent, ecstasy type narcotics and occultism makes me shudder.<p>I see it to be far more sensible to have kids crawling all over a tree in the light of day as opposed to tunnelling around the root system in the dead of night. So I have inverted the Cabala and plunged Kether into the depth of Hell. The original Cabala will make a safe and sane anchor in Mankind's unconscious with nothing able to branch out involuntarily from the original ten sephirah. This inversion will bring the chaotic and unchecked growth of the roots of the Celtic Faerie tree into the light of day, the roots now becoming the branches of a living tree. I have nailed 22 rungs to the tree so it is safe to go up and down. The systems of gates are merely safety gates to stop the blast of kundalini damaging the unprepared, the worst that can happen is that they will go sideways and loop the loop, arriving back in the mental condition in which they started without having gone anywhere. For those who are able to ascend through the Chakra system all they attain is access to the wheel of life, something of which us mere mortals still have no control. Of course there are no sanctions or prohibitions as to where one may venture in his or her exploration of the canopy. Just remember that you are traipsing through the tendrils of human thought and be sure to make certain the branch is sturdy before committing yourself because falling out of a tree is no fun. <p>For those interested in the darkness of the human soul there are 26 steps downward along the well-worn path of initiation. I can strongly recommend a warning that God or the Devil, who ever resides down/up there does not want to meet you face to face. Do not even bother contemplating your entrance into the holy Cabala, it is a closed power base with no access. The safest distance, I think, to contemplate God from is the Tiphareth of this world which corresponds with the Veil of Isis in the initiation sequence. I never lifted the Veil to gaze at Isis in all her glory.<p>12/ THE STAFFS OF JOHN: THE HANGED MAN              <br>The parallel staffs of John are a reminder that the Masonic azimuth poles need to be uncrossed at such a time to prevent Earth from metaphorically spiralling out of control due to the build up of accumulated error just like an over wound spring. This being a metaphor for the time when Man will unleash himself from the erroneous preconception of belief systems and allow his consciousness to set sail upon the great unknown entrusting his direction into the hands of Truth. <br> <br>13/ OPENING THE DOOR: DEATH<br>A constant repetition of the age weary motif of the mythical hero descending into Hades to retrieve the subconscious information necessary to complete the task that redeems himself, saves the future for mankind, restores the Ancestors and gets the girl. I refused to go any lower than I already was so I am describing the motif of the hero's task from Joseph Campbell and not the subconscious sensations of my own experience. <p>14/ THE TWINS: TEMPERANCE <br>"The Twins undoing their unusual embrace" in the Monmouth poem, is a measurement of the 4.5 degrees that separates Castor and Pollux in the Gemini constellation. That angular distance between the twin's embrace would appear undone according to any shift of Earth's axis. The twins are also the opposite directions in which the two fish of Pisces swim. Reminding us that, in theory, the Earth has the ability to change its direction of axial rotation which would also alter the backwards wobble of the precessional zodiac. Instead of entering the age of Aquarius the Earths vernal equinox would trace its steps back through Pisces then Aries then Taurus and so forth. <p>15/ THE CROOKED HORNS OF ARIES: THE DEVIL<br>"The crooked horns of Aries" in the Monmouth poem, continually shoring up the Scales of Libra is describing how at the end of the age of Aries, in 432 AD, the Cardinal cross which dissected the solstices and equinoxes was no longer square due to the Earth's precession. The church developed the mutable Cross this time aligning the cross to the new equinoxes and solstices of Pisces, Virgo, Sagittarius and Gemini. The Astrological significance of the Christian myth was veiled and coded throughout the New Testament by church Astrologers who were <br>looking to distance themselves from the Astrologers of the previous age who had drawn a blank when predicting that the New Jerusalem would come at the end of Aries. <p>Nauseating as it may seem love is evolve backwards and the Devil backwards is lived. The polarisation of the human spirit into light and dark, good and evil has well served its purpose. It has enabled the individual to learn <br>the lesson that we can not amputate or hide bits of ourselves simply because we or other people do not like that part of us. To remain whole we must accept ourselves and others, warts and all. If someone was to tell us that the God we held sacred was really a conniving so and so who was responsible for all the misery, pain and horror in the world. That in fact he was the one who was expelled from heaven would you love God any less? Of course not, we wouldn't care if our God was called Lucifer or not and we all suffer from pride and egomaniacal ideas from time to time. At the end of the day it's God we love and his plan has got us this far so just because God's not perfect why would we want to abandon the relationship.<br>  <br>16/ THE HOLY GRAIL: DESTRUCTION OF THE TOWER        <br>The Holy Grail is the desire for immortality that sustains the quest to find the portal into the 4th dimension. The lamed King is continually reincarnated as the young prince who resides in the castle of Arianrhod. Until such time as mankind is able to open the dimensional door of time and space and reincarnate the dead, the Grail will destroy all those who accept it when it is offered. <br>                  <br>17/ LUCIFER: THE STAR                    <br>Meeting the God/Devil is the realisation that, at some point there will be the technology to receive the etheric transmissions of time and space. The viewing of the Akashic record via a search engine, what is nicknamed first time TV. The realisation of this sends those who have not been honest about their nature into a tail spin.<p>18/ THE CASTLE OF ARIANRHOD: THE MOON<br>A huge crack on the skull reminiscent of the scarred right forehead of Hiram Abiff. This reminds us that humanity has trodden the path of spirituality for so long in the illuminating glow of delusion that we consciously know our way blind folded. We no longer need to listen to the prattle of secret societies, religion and the occultism of others for cosmic truth. The generations born after the 2000's are born with the clear vision and clairaudience that will allow them to listen to their own subconscious. The only reason we have arrived safely into the third millennium AD is because of the men and women who wrote and perpetuated the myths involved in secret societies and religion, the believers. <p>Now its time to put away the protecting comfort of belief structures and face up to the truth which is, we do not know the truth. Our belief in God is an unsubstantiated theory. The fact is that if we, as a race, continue passed this point in our evolution without pausing to establish who, what, when and where we are we risk stretching Ariadne's thread to breaking point. If we break the thread we have doomed our future generations to, no matter how advanced they become, never being able to trace their path back to the beginning. If the dream is true and at the beginning they will find the end and conscious eternity would have been created, well it means we stuffed it for everyone including ourselves. <p>If, on the other hand, our Ancestors do not wish humanity to arrive home as space and time conquering baboons and the losing of our history is an evolutionary programmed protection for the evolving universe, then yes we must blindly push on or be turned to stone if we look around. So at this point we should use the cunning of Hercules when capturing the Gorgons head by means of a mirror. We use the reflection of the moon by which to study the universe. Forget about Mars for the moment and pour the cash into a fully functioning moon base. So that in this generation many of us will get a chance to stomp around up there, "one step for man" is the saddest boast to hear 31 years later when many steps of mankind should, by this stage, be how the moon is regarded.<p>19/ THE GRAIL QUESTION:  THE SUN                        <br>If you had just one question, what would you ask?                                                                                                <br>Do you love me? was my question. Then they carped on about it being the wrong question. I didn't at the time know that I was meant to ask "whom does the Grail serve". Any way I demanded that my question be answered and they told me no so I immediately told them to sod off at which stage other voices entered the arena and said that they did love me so we were all friends again.<p>20/ FEAR OF DEATH:  THE  AEON<br>Are you willing to die for what you believe? No, no belief is worth dying for, except love of a good idea.<br>I agreed to die and there is a blank spot in my recollection but as you can see it was only crap. The sad part is that by this stage I did believe that I was speaking with people who were in contact with the Gods. So you can imagine my disappointment in realising that it was all just nonsense.<br>   <br>21/ THE JUDAS SEAT: THE FOOL <br>Being risen up and sitting upon the Judas seat is the opening up of yourself psychologically so it can be judged what kind of person you really are; I have another blank spot after I told them I was no Judas. I have since read about the Siege Perilous (the Judas seat) at which only the spiritually pure may sit.    <br>                 <br>22/ THE CHOICE: THE WORLD                            <br>The choice of the Grail aspirant to either replace the King at the Grail Castle or go out through the door into the unknown or return to their previous life is a confirmation that we are imprisoned in the reality of this life and have no choice at all. The only escape we have at the moment is imagination. Mans basic desire for immortality will one day lead all of mankind to the Grail Castle's door to eternity and the decision to either stay, go or return will be a scientific one. <p>I was not interested in choosing because I did not like any of the alternatives but they became very insistent threatening to hurt my loved ones. I asked where the old man was and in my imagination I tied a rope around his waist so we wouldn't get separated and my plan was that we were going to jump into the unknown together. At the door to the unknown, which I was imagining, he went through but obviously my reality gate could only warp so far before commonsense kicked in and the game was up. I was still in the police cell and the last idiotic comment I heard from the great cop brotherhood was<p>                               "Duh, What happened to the him"<br>                                 Voice 2 "He's gone"<br>                                 Voice 1 "Oh wow and she returned"<p>Had it not been such utter crap I would have been floating in space tied to some old guy looking for a fertile planet to settle down. I never elected to return to my crummy present conditions the only reason I returned is because I never had any choice at all.<p>There is a lot of, they said, I said, which I have not bothered to elaborate upon. I have only recalled my thoughts and their questions that were pertinent to each stage of the sequence. Many times the situation became bogged down by me refusing to be lead in the direction 'whomever' was trying to take me at any given stage. If I had been asked normally I would have been delighted to help anyone with their esoteric study. When I told them that I had written a new Cabala and Tarot (it was crap and I threw it away a year later) they wanted me to give it to them and I refused. Not because I did not want them to have it, I didn't want them to have it exclusively. I was a bit scared that one of them was even nasty enough to hurt me just to get his hands on the "ability to make money on cards and horses". I can joke now but at the time I was quite frightened.<p>Tuesday the 23rd of January 2001<br>E-mail or IM me at  SARAHJAYNE0000@AOL.COM<br>http://hometown.aol.com/sarahjayne0000/myhomepage/index.html<p>Dear Person, 										<br>I am looking for information on the groups who use the initiation sequence R.J.Stewart wrote about in his double book "Merlin, the prophetic vision and mystic life," republished 1994. I have previously sent E-mail to Stewarts@Dreampower.com but unfortunately they have not responded.<p>I am aware how bits and pieces of the Western Mystery Tradition have been incorporated into many covens, groves, orders and secret societies. The one outstanding factor of the group I am trying to trace is that they use all of the topics which R.J.Stewart discusses in his books, The Mystic Life of Merlin and The Prophetic Vision of Merlin first published in 1985 and 1986. I had a bizarre experience with a group of policemen who used the sequence I describe below.<p>Do You know if Stewart is quoting from an established group or whether he is describing an initiation sequence of his own eclectic design; thus the group coming after his book? If so, do you know of any order taking his books so much to heart?<p>I have thought long and hard about what happened that night and here is what I think is a fairly plausible account. The night of my arrest was a Friday. Somewhere close to where I was being detained an occult ceremony was being held. Young police who were on duty that night were also junior members of the association which was holding the meeting. When I screamed out from my cell that I had found the Holy Grail I attracted the interest of the young initiate officers who then proceeded to try and cheat their grades by finding out the answer to the riddle of 3, 4 and 6. At which stage an older initiate has caught them and shooed them away. I think at this time that person contacted the group who were having their meeting. Then for the next three or so hours these people toyed with me. I am a serious student of metaphysics so my subconscious is full of esoteric triggers. The cells have both surveillance cameras and intercom.<br>  		                      <br>The discussion went as follows: Robert Kirk. The riddle of 3, 4 and 6. Ariadne the weaver goddess. The spider, the mythical 13th sign of the zodiac. The Pearl. The Veil of Isis. Janus and Anna Perenna. Opening the door. The Tree of Life. Calling the Urn to the Fountain. Sophia Mundi. The Root and the Branch exchanging places. The two Masonic Staffs of John. Descending to the other world. The Twins undoing their unusual embrace. Aries shoring up Libra. Being offered the Grail. Meeting God/Devil. The Castle of  Arianrhod. Asking the question. Dying to this life. Being raised up to the Judas seat. And finally, being made to choose to (stay, go or return) in the presence of the old king lying on a bed.<br>  <br>I have studied European myth and renaissance Cabalism and I am familiar with some of the ideologies of the Masonic, Arthurian, Tarot and Astrological references of the above. In hindsight I am aware that many of the motifs have been furnished from Robert Graves'  historical grammar of poetic myth, "The White Goddess". While the apocalyptic end to Geoffrey Momouth's 12th century poem the Vita Merlini has been directly quoted from and can also be downloaded at Stewarts@Dreampower.com. At the time I was disgusted by these people, that was 4 years ago and I now wish to contact them for friendly reasons<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter <br>Yours sincerely Sarah<br>

<textarea name="body" COLS=50 ROWS=10>
: 1/ ROBERT KIRK: THE MAGICIAN 
: Robert Kirk, author of the Secret Commonwealth of Faerie circa 1610. Robert John Stewart's &quot;Robert Kirk Walker between the Worlds&quot; available for free download from Stewarts@Dreampower.com.
: When my inquisitors spoke of Robert I recited my crude &quot;Bob down and suck on  this&quot; joke we liked to use about my brother in law, Robert. When they spoke about Kirk I thought they were talking about Captain Kirk of the Enterprise so the charade accelerated because they thought I was talking about Robert Kirk. So when they said he was really out there I was quite enthusiastic about the idea and not till later did I learn that they were implying that a 17th century Priest was still alive in Faerieland.

: 2/ THE RIDDLE OF 3, 4 AND 6: THE  PRIESTESS
: The answer to the riddle is the 5th line from the poem found in Robert Grave's book &quot;The White Goddess&quot;. 
: The answer to the riddle is the Goddess; not Enoch or Kai. The question the riddle asks is 'who was with my lord in the highest sphere'? Taken from the riddle of Taliesin written by the 6th century bard, the historical Taliesin. Lines 3 through to 6 of the poem sum up the whole God as the fallen Lucifer concept recurrent throughout the mysteries.
: &quot;Indo and Heinin called me Merddin                                                                                                         At length every king will call me Taliesin                                                                                                 I was with my Lord in the highest sphere                                                                                                   On the fall of Lucifer into the depth of hell&quot;  

: 3/ THE EMPRESS: ARIADNE 
: Ariadne as the weaver goddess acts as time keeper of the universe.

: 4/ THE EMPEROR: ARACHNE             
: At the right time Ariadne cocoons the Fisher King so the Emperor remains safe through the long night of the soul, the galactic winter. The eight legs of the spider symbolise the 8 divisions of the annual solar clock and of course spiders make the best fisherman. The spider was Robert the Bruce's companion when he was in the cave. Arachne, the mythical 13th sign of the zodiac was another weaver goddess; who Athena turned into a spider when she was found hanging after losing a boastful bet with Athena.

: 5/ THE PEARL: THE HIEROPHANT               
: The pearl as the motif for wisdom and the alchemical Great Work transmits the idea that life can be cultured forth from the freezer as in invitro fertilisation. The oyster is its ark. The hierophant possesses the key of King Solomon. The Pope symbolises esoteric secrets handed down through the ages. Let us now take advantage of this period of religious freedom and remember that secrets are only necessary when you are in fear of reprimand. To hear of people swearing oaths to keep secret about esoteric doctrine is absolutely ludicrous in this day and age when it is all in legally available books anyway. Essentially secrets block the way of Truth and any Truth that has been made a secret festers, rots and eventually becomes only a shadow of itself. &quot;I swear not to keep secret&quot; has always been the earnest Cabalist's credo.                             

: 6/ THE VEIL OF ISIS: THE LOVERS              
: The veil of Isis is a lace work of salt from the tears cried by people who have opened Janus' door and gazed upon nothing. They have lost their greatest love and they are alone. Path workers of the Cabala know Janus as Saturn who patrols between Yesod and Tiphareth. The veil of Isis is pierced to allow travel through the desert of the abyss, the path between Tiphareth, (Daath) and Kether. When I began to see the mists of Isis I shut my eyes and demanded that I was not interested in seeing any &quot;spooky stuff&quot;. For the remainder of the time I kept my eyes shut which stopped me from hallucinating.

: 7/ JANUS AND ANNA PERENNA: THE CHARIOT           
: Janus symbolises the reality gate between conscious and subconscious. When the, would be, tormentors told me to open the door I refused and told them to open their own door. The two faces of Anna Perenna are the future and the past. In her duel aspect she is both maiden and crone and always mother. Carina the constellation of the Keel which houses the keyhole nebula and the star Carinae, whom is the Goddess on which the door of Janus is hinged, was part of the dismantled constellation Argo Navis the ship of the Argonauts. Carinae is also one of the stars that makes up the false cross. 

: 8/ AND 11/ THE ROOT AND THE BRANCH: STRENGTH AND JUSTICE                    
: The Tree of Life glyph may be a  two dimensional diagram of a molecular structure. When mankind can decode the glyph he may be able to reproduce life. It is also a metaphysical star map pointing the way home for man's consciousness for when we have evolved enough to make the journey. The Tree of Life, the Christmas tree and the tree growing into Faerie land symbolise the Earth's axis. The myths associated with the zodiac are mans attempt to predict a future time frame, mythology or the 'word' constraining mans development through preordination. The wheel has been lashed, man tied to the mast and the course set in a cyclic motion. All solar myths are nailed on to the Masonic azimuth poles in the shape of a cross preventing any deviation from mans destination. In the interim the tree grows deeper and deeper into faerie land, mans collective unconscious.

: When I was asked if I knew what the glyph was I responded &quot;darned if I know&quot; but then quoted the theory that it might be a representation of a strand of DNA. At this point I had the thought that the glyph is so beyond my comprehension that putting it into words would only be erroneous. After a brief investigation of the Indian Chakra system I am inclined to think the Tree of Life is simply the Jewish version of the Chakra system. Imaging the ten Sephirah as Chakras and the 7 main Chakras as Sephirah has provided a clarity and simplicity which resounds with a logic I find appealing.
:     
: 9/ THE URN: THE HERMIT       
: Some Astrologers believe that the rise and fall of a race of mankind is timed to a Galactic seasonal clock. The time interval from rise to fall is a multiplication of the celestial microcosmic clock of our own zodiac. On a macrocosmic scale one turn of the zodiacal clock depicts the celestial seasonal year of Earth from completely frozen and uninhabitable to lush and life producing and back to ice age again. Capricorn of the celestial year is the long night of the soul, the Galactic winter. Its polar opposite, Cancer is the life ripening mother of summer. The genetic racial memories of humankind have allowed him to be born with an in built evolutionary clock warning system. We make up stories in response to racial memories. The Hermit is the repository of all Hermetic knowledge. He is the seed of the Cabala that has been sown into the fabric of man's unconscious. The seed is the genetic characteristics installed in our DNA that enable successful evolution.

: 10/ SOPHIA MUNDI: THE ROTA
: Mundi is none of your business. When I said that I was actually referring to my two dead cats who were called Barra and Mundi after the fish Barramundi. Mundi was lost off the boat earlier that year and Barra was shot the year before and to this day I am sensitive about losing those cats. I suppose my inquisitors thought I was being secretive about the Gnostic and Templar association with the God's wife principle that I read about after my trial. The wheel of fortune contains the Tarot that is the key to the magical Cabala. The mathematical formulae contained within the Tarot pack is beyond my comprehension but in times of stress I find myself able to talk to myself using the cards as archetypal thought props. At the end of the day, no matter how symbolic or metaphysically insightful you find the Tarot, the fortune telling aspects are just a card game. 

: During my ordeal I was tricked into believing that I was being psychically opened up by these people and that at each stage I was &quot;communing at a higher level&quot; until I had reached the spirit realm. Even though my disbelief was suspended and I was psychologically defenceless and completely vulnerable to these people I was able to retain my integrity and not be lead into the insidious &quot;come again Christ&quot; trip that they were pushing me so hard toward. I love Christ and it was only my knowledge of the Tarot and my liking of Crowley that saved me from being sucked into such a cruel heart breaking Trick as to make me believe that Christ had returned.

: I wrote the Tarot comparison page as a way of describing my psychological journey into what I believe to be the realm of insanity. One of the complaints I made to these people was that they were using the Cabala which is a Jewish esoteric system and certainly not intended for any Neo-Nazi police force. The next strong impression I received was that they had extended the Cabala and were actually inverting it which is a standard practice of black magic &quot;to reverse or reflect&quot; what is good. I felt they had, by interfering with the Cabala, opened up a can of worms that they had not the depth of imagination to perceive. Later I had my suspicions confirmed when I saw a Tree of Life Glyph in Stewart's book with three corrupted sephirah extended passed Malkuth in a straight line into what Stewart thought as of Faerie land. What a hideous place to anchor a meditation system, in the human subconscious, which we know has the potential to be as mad as a Hatter's Tea Party. When I read about the mythical aspects of the 17th century Priest and Author Robert Kirk who was lost in Faerieland I felt great empathy for this archetypal explorer of the dark human subconscious.

: 11/ AND 8/ THE BRANCH AND THE ROOT: JUSTICE AND STRENGTH
: So out of bad comes good, maybe by interfering with the Cabala, the New Age movement has furnished our generation with a root system to the tree of life. My concern was to show a straight path out of the insanity for people like myself who have been psychologically dunked. As I have already mentioned, I do not practice the occult I simply study. The authors of the Cabala were not able to stop the degeneration of a meditational system, that enables you to contemplate God and your own existence, into a parlour trick for power seekers. So I believe it to be 'fait accompli' that is what the Cabala has become, a powerful &quot;magical&quot; device. Magical power is such a big hook for our younger generation that I think it is important to make this system psychologically kid proof before the nasty people out there get the chance to flush a generation of the most clairvoyant kids ever down the toilets of their back alley secret societies. The combination of evil intent, ecstasy type narcotics and occultism makes me shudder.

: I see it to be far more sensible to have kids crawling all over a tree in the light of day as opposed to tunnelling around the root system in the dead of night. So I have inverted the Cabala and plunged Kether into the depth of Hell. The original Cabala will make a safe and sane anchor in Mankind's unconscious with nothing able to branch out involuntarily from the original ten sephirah. This inversion will bring the chaotic and unchecked growth of the roots of the Celtic Faerie tree into the light of day, the roots now becoming the branches of a living tree. I have nailed 22 rungs to the tree so it is safe to go up and down. The systems of gates are merely safety gates to stop the blast of kundalini damaging the unprepared, the worst that can happen is that they will go sideways and loop the loop, arriving back in the mental condition in which they started without having gone anywhere. For those who are able to ascend through the Chakra system all they attain is access to the wheel of life, something of which us mere mortals still have no control. Of course there are no sanctions or prohibitions as to where one may venture in his or her exploration of the canopy. Just remember that you are traipsing through the tendrils of human thought and be sure to make certain the branch is sturdy before committing yourself because falling out of a tree is no fun. 

: For those interested in the darkness of the human soul there are 26 steps downward along the well-worn path of initiation. I can strongly recommend a warning that God or the Devil, who ever resides down/up there does not want to meet you face to face. Do not even bother contemplating your entrance into the holy Cabala, it is a closed power base with no access. The safest distance, I think, to contemplate God from is the Tiphareth of this world which corresponds with the Veil of Isis in the initiation sequence. I never lifted the Veil to gaze at Isis in all her glory.

: 12/ THE STAFFS OF JOHN: THE HANGED MAN              
: The parallel staffs of John are a reminder that the Masonic azimuth poles need to be uncrossed at such a time to prevent Earth from metaphorically spiralling out of control due to the build up of accumulated error just like an over wound spring. This being a metaphor for the time when Man will unleash himself from the erroneous preconception of belief systems and allow his consciousness to set sail upon the great unknown entrusting his direction into the hands of Truth. 
:  
: 13/ OPENING THE DOOR: DEATH
: A constant repetition of the age weary motif of the mythical hero descending into Hades to retrieve the subconscious information necessary to complete the task that redeems himself, saves the future for mankind, restores the Ancestors and gets the girl. I refused to go any lower than I already was so I am describing the motif of the hero's task from Joseph Campbell and not the subconscious sensations of my own experience. 

: 14/ THE TWINS: TEMPERANCE 
: &quot;The Twins undoing their unusual embrace&quot; in the Monmouth poem, is a measurement of the 4.5 degrees that separates Castor and Pollux in the Gemini constellation. That angular distance between the twin's embrace would appear undone according to any shift of Earth's axis. The twins are also the opposite directions in which the two fish of Pisces swim. Reminding us that, in theory, the Earth has the ability to change its direction of axial rotation which would also alter the backwards wobble of the precessional zodiac. Instead of entering the age of Aquarius the Earths vernal equinox would trace its steps back through Pisces then Aries then Taurus and so forth. 

: 15/ THE CROOKED HORNS OF ARIES: THE DEVIL
: &quot;The crooked horns of Aries&quot; in the Monmouth poem, continually shoring up the Scales of Libra is describing how at the end of the age of Aries, in 432 AD, the Cardinal cross which dissected the solstices and equinoxes was no longer square due to the Earth's precession. The church developed the mutable Cross this time aligning the cross to the new equinoxes and solstices of Pisces, Virgo, Sagittarius and Gemini. The Astrological significance of the Christian myth was veiled and coded throughout the New Testament by church Astrologers who were 
: looking to distance themselves from the Astrologers of the previous age who had drawn a blank when predicting that the New Jerusalem would come at the end of Aries. 

: Nauseating as it may seem love is evolve backwards and the Devil backwards is lived. The polarisation of the human spirit into light and dark, good and evil has well served its purpose. It has enabled the individual to learn 
: the lesson that we can not amputate or hide bits of ourselves simply because we or other people do not like that part of us. To remain whole we must accept ourselves and others, warts and all. If someone was to tell us that the God we held sacred was really a conniving so and so who was responsible for all the misery, pain and horror in the world. That in fact he was the one who was expelled from heaven would you love God any less? Of course not, we wouldn't care if our God was called Lucifer or not and we all suffer from pride and egomaniacal ideas from time to time. At the end of the day it's God we love and his plan has got us this far so just because God's not perfect why would we want to abandon the relationship.
:   
: 16/ THE HOLY GRAIL: DESTRUCTION OF THE TOWER        
: The Holy Grail is the desire for immortality that sustains the quest to find the portal into the 4th dimension. The lamed King is continually reincarnated as the young prince who resides in the castle of Arianrhod. Until such time as mankind is able to open the dimensional door of time and space and reincarnate the dead, the Grail will destroy all those who accept it when it is offered. 
:                   
: 17/ LUCIFER: THE STAR                    
: Meeting the God/Devil is the realisation that, at some point there will be the technology to receive the etheric transmissions of time and space. The viewing of the Akashic record via a search engine, what is nicknamed first time TV. The realisation of this sends those who have not been honest about their nature into a tail spin.

: 18/ THE CASTLE OF ARIANRHOD: THE MOON
: A huge crack on the skull reminiscent of the scarred right forehead of Hiram Abiff. This reminds us that humanity has trodden the path of spirituality for so long in the illuminating glow of delusion that we consciously know our way blind folded. We no longer need to listen to the prattle of secret societies, religion and the occultism of others for cosmic truth. The generations born after the 2000's are born with the clear vision and clairaudience that will allow them to listen to their own subconscious. The only reason we have arrived safely into the third millennium AD is because of the men and women who wrote and perpetuated the myths involved in secret societies and religion, the believers. 

: Now its time to put away the protecting comfort of belief structures and face up to the truth which is, we do not know the truth. Our belief in God is an unsubstantiated theory. The fact is that if we, as a race, continue passed this point in our evolution without pausing to establish who, what, when and where we are we risk stretching Ariadne's thread to breaking point. If we break the thread we have doomed our future generations to, no matter how advanced they become, never being able to trace their path back to the beginning. If the dream is true and at the beginning they will find the end and conscious eternity would have been created, well it means we stuffed it for everyone including ourselves. 

: If, on the other hand, our Ancestors do not wish humanity to arrive home as space and time conquering baboons and the losing of our history is an evolutionary programmed protection for the evolving universe, then yes we must blindly push on or be turned to stone if we look around. So at this point we should use the cunning of Hercules when capturing the Gorgons head by means of a mirror. We use the reflection of the moon by which to study the universe. Forget about Mars for the moment and pour the cash into a fully functioning moon base. So that in this generation many of us will get a chance to stomp around up there, &quot;one step for man&quot; is the saddest boast to hear 31 years later when many steps of mankind should, by this stage, be how the moon is regarded.

: 19/ THE GRAIL QUESTION:  THE SUN                        
: If you had just one question, what would you ask?                                                                                                
: Do you love me? was my question. Then they carped on about it being the wrong question. I didn't at the time know that I was meant to ask &quot;whom does the Grail serve&quot;. Any way I demanded that my question be answered and they told me no so I immediately told them to sod off at which stage other voices entered the arena and said that they did love me so we were all friends again.

: 20/ FEAR OF DEATH:  THE  AEON
: Are you willing to die for what you believe? No, no belief is worth dying for, except love of a good idea.
: I agreed to die and there is a blank spot in my recollection but as you can see it was only crap. The sad part is that by this stage I did believe that I was speaking with people who were in contact with the Gods. So you can imagine my disappointment in realising that it was all just nonsense.
:    
: 21/ THE JUDAS SEAT: THE FOOL 
: Being risen up and sitting upon the Judas seat is the opening up of yourself psychologically so it can be judged what kind of person you really are; I have another blank spot after I told them I was no Judas. I have since read about the Siege Perilous (the Judas seat) at which only the spiritually pure may sit.    
:                  
: 22/ THE CHOICE: THE WORLD                            
: The choice of the Grail aspirant to either replace the King at the Grail Castle or go out through the door into the unknown or return to their previous life is a confirmation that we are imprisoned in the reality of this life and have no choice at all. The only escape we have at the moment is imagination. Mans basic desire for immortality will one day lead all of mankind to the Grail Castle's door to eternity and the decision to either stay, go or return will be a scientific one. 

: I was not interested in choosing because I did not like any of the alternatives but they became very insistent threatening to hurt my loved ones. I asked where the old man was and in my imagination I tied a rope around his waist so we wouldn't get separated and my plan was that we were going to jump into the unknown together. At the door to the unknown, which I was imagining, he went through but obviously my reality gate could only warp so far before commonsense kicked in and the game was up. I was still in the police cell and the last idiotic comment I heard from the great cop brotherhood was

:                                &quot;Duh, What happened to the him&quot;
:                                  Voice 2 &quot;He's gone&quot;
:                                  Voice 1 &quot;Oh wow and she returned&quot;

: Had it not been such utter crap I would have been floating in space tied to some old guy looking for a fertile planet to settle down. I never elected to return to my crummy present conditions the only reason I returned is because I never had any choice at all.

: There is a lot of, they said, I said, which I have not bothered to elaborate upon. I have only recalled my thoughts and their questions that were pertinent to each stage of the sequence. Many times the situation became bogged down by me refusing to be lead in the direction 'whomever' was trying to take me at any given stage. If I had been asked normally I would have been delighted to help anyone with their esoteric study. When I told them that I had written a new Cabala and Tarot (it was crap and I threw it away a year later) they wanted me to give it to them and I refused. Not because I did not want them to have it, I didn't want them to have it exclusively. I was a bit scared that one of them was even nasty enough to hurt me just to get his hands on the &quot;ability to make money on cards and horses&quot;. I can joke now but at the time I was quite frightened.

: Tuesday the 23rd of January 2001
: E-mail or IM me at  SARAHJAYNE0000@AOL.COM
: http://hometown.aol.com/sarahjayne0000/myhomepage/index.html

: Dear Person, 										
: I am looking for information on the groups who use the initiation sequence R.J.Stewart wrote about in his double book &quot;Merlin, the prophetic vision and mystic life,&quot; republished 1994. I have previously sent E-mail to Stewarts@Dreampower.com but unfortunately they have not responded.

: I am aware how bits and pieces of the Western Mystery Tradition have been incorporated into many covens, groves, orders and secret societies. The one outstanding factor of the group I am trying to trace is that they use all of the topics which R.J.Stewart discusses in his books, The Mystic Life of Merlin and The Prophetic Vision of Merlin first published in 1985 and 1986. I had a bizarre experience with a group of policemen who used the sequence I describe below.

: Do You know if Stewart is quoting from an established group or whether he is describing an initiation sequence of his own eclectic design; thus the group coming after his book? If so, do you know of any order taking his books so much to heart?

: I have thought long and hard about what happened that night and here is what I think is a fairly plausible account. The night of my arrest was a Friday. Somewhere close to where I was being detained an occult ceremony was being held. Young police who were on duty that night were also junior members of the association which was holding the meeting. When I screamed out from my cell that I had found the Holy Grail I attracted the interest of the young initiate officers who then proceeded to try and cheat their grades by finding out the answer to the riddle of 3, 4 and 6. At which stage an older initiate has caught them and shooed them away. I think at this time that person contacted the group who were having their meeting. Then for the next three or so hours these people toyed with me. I am a serious student of metaphysics so my subconscious is full of esoteric triggers. The cells have both surveillance cameras and intercom.
:   		                      
: The discussion went as follows: Robert Kirk. The riddle of 3, 4 and 6. Ariadne the weaver goddess. The spider, the mythical 13th sign of the zodiac. The Pearl. The Veil of Isis. Janus and Anna Perenna. Opening the door. The Tree of Life. Calling the Urn to the Fountain. Sophia Mundi. The Root and the Branch exchanging places. The two Masonic Staffs of John. Descending to the other world. The Twins undoing their unusual embrace. Aries shoring up Libra. Being offered the Grail. Meeting God/Devil. The Castle of  Arianrhod. Asking the question. Dying to this life. Being raised up to the Judas seat. And finally, being made to choose to (stay, go or return) in the presence of the old king lying on a bed.
:   
: I have studied European myth and renaissance Cabalism and I am familiar with some of the ideologies of the Masonic, Arthurian, Tarot and Astrological references of the above. In hindsight I am aware that many of the motifs have been furnished from Robert Graves'  historical grammar of poetic myth, &quot;The White Goddess&quot;. While the apocalyptic end to Geoffrey Momouth's 12th century poem the Vita Merlini has been directly quoted from and can also be downloaded at Stewarts@Dreampower.com. At the time I was disgusted by these people, that was 4 years ago and I now wish to contact them for friendly reasons

: Thank you for your attention to this matter 
: Yours sincerely Sarah
