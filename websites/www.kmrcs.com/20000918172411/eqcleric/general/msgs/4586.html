List me the items you see on the other clerics around your level that you cant wear/use because you are DE. <br>So you say PoF armor. Syntax error. Fixed (or soon will be)<br>So you say the BB hammer?...well guess what 99.999% of the clerics cant get this either so dont even go there.<br>Well if your stuff is sh!# then so is every other cleric (cept the tiny few that get a BB hammer (thats if a paladin dont get it first)) on every other server out there.<br>So again i ask...what makes your ass so much better than the all the other 45th levl clerics out there? Why do you deserve better stuff than the rest of us clerics?<br>Your 45th level cleric can wear all the same armor and items i got, weild all the same weapons i got and be just as effective in a group as me.<br>So whats your problem? You cant do crappy quest that 98% of all the clerics that could do them didnt want to (cause they suck)?  Items do not make a good cleric.<br>Case in point is the cleric on our server that has the BB hammer. <br>I've never played with them but i bet you 10-1 that he is not very good cleric. He bought the account somewhere between 47-50th level. So im guess they have low-very low group combat skills<br>Him possessing the hammer really dont mean squat. Think about it. Is this cleric gonna be wadeing into combat instead of concentrating on healing? Im sure parties will love that.Do think this awesome weapon in the hands of a cleric is even going to put a dent in a high level mobs hps?<br>Do you think he can even go whoop up on a SG with this thing? Ha!  The SG would eat his lunch if he tried to stand toe to toe with him. <p><p><br>: Why you say this?<p>: How was I supposed to know 45 levels ago that there is nothing for us in the game but shit? I have played way too long now to quit on this character. It's great that people start to react to this, because then maybe something will be done.<p>: If somethings completely wrong, do you always just turn your back to it? No, you fight for what you believe is right.<p>: /patz<p>
