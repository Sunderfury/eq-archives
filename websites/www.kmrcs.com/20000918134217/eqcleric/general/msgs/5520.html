: Was Lempeck inside the farmhouse, or on the roof?

: When on the roof, I found he would accept the potion, say thanks, get faction, then he called for guards and attacked without getting the Scythe.

: When he was inside, no problem.

: The last time I helped someone get the SSoL, Lempeck was back up on the roof. We /petitioned a GM to come haul him down.

: That has been my experience.
