The best thing I have found to do is this, wait till the absolute possible second to heal a tank, usually this gives them time to get way up on the mobs hate list. Usually I wait till a tank is down to 2 bubs of health, then drop a complete heal on them, I have found that mobs will aggro a little bit less, and plus it is much more efficient.  I see a lot of clerics that will pop a super heal on a tank when he's only a bub down on health.  Some say that it is better to keep them healed that way, but imho I think you save more time and energy with complete heal.  Of course, there are always times when the mob will aggro on you anyways, all you can do is hope your tanks are good and can taunt it off, if they can't, then use divine aura or barrier to protect yourself, after the mobs swing at you a few times and realize they can't hurt you, they will go back to smacking the tanks around ;)<p>Just my 2 cents worth <p>Ianina Faithhealer<br>High Cleric of Tunare<br>40th circle<br>Tarew Marr<p>: There may be no good answer to this, but here goes with the question anyway.<p>: Lately, in the higher level dungeons, the tanks will drag about 5 things back and start banging one one of them.
