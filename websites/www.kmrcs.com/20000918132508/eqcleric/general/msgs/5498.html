The spawn time of the ignot on the stump in Kithicor and the diary are separated by 2 minutes.  Cleary the gap could have widened since yesterday morning, but I doubt by much.  Unfortunately, the items are starting to get camped on our server as more and more people figure out where to go.  For a cleric as noble and honorable as yourself, you might not want to spend the time on them (they are only AC 9 and +6 sv disease)  Buuuuttt...the desire to be a golden cleric may override that.  Happy hunting..err..shall I say camping.<p>Othar<br>
