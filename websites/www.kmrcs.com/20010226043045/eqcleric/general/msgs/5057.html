: At lower levels there are lot's of places to hunt, as you progress past 30 these areas were hunting is possible get fewer and fewer. The problem you have is not a Cleric issue it is a combernation of the serer maturing and fewer places to effectivly hunt.

: Since hitting 30 and reluctantly leaving my regular party (combernation of outleveling and a few factions/disruptions) I have been hitting areas like Cazic, Lower Guk and Sol B.

: On my server this hasn't been a problem for me. Primaraly this is becouse I am a cleric (and there must be fewer clerics than on your server). 

: I can pritty much wounder into Lower Guk and get a group within minutes or even seconds. A simple shout of &quot;anyone need a cleric&quot; often gett's me 1 to 3 tells almost Straight away. One most occations there have been tank's/druids/casters looking for groups before and long after I have found a party.

: Sol B is a bit less succesfull, but I am, or at least was the last time I was up there, still fairly low for a lot of the stuff in that area. I only get a group here about 75% of the times I have been here.

: If you are having problems on your server it is becouse you are seeing the same sort of problems as these other classes are seeing on my server.

: The only suggestion I can think of is to try and find a good guild which hunts together on a regluar basis, try a differant server, or start a new chariacter.

: Your post seemed to suggest that it was a a cleric problem, which is simply not the case.

: For me personaly it just seems to be getting better, the people I have been meating and grouping with give me tell's to join there groups, and I have been included in a number of guild hunts (not my guild) when they have been short of clerics.
