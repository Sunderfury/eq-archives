: : If you are stupid and go where you OBVIOUSLY<br>: don't belong<p>: not certain if this was diected at me or not ;). As it happons though we were in a well balanaced (if a bit level staggerd) party consisting of cleric, tank, shaman, mage and wiz. I am 36th, the pal was 49, and the rest were around 40 - 45 I think. We cleared the route and the spawn and held that spot as well a fetch from enouther spot successfully for over 4 hours before my depth. So I certainly wasn't out of my depth ;)<p>Of course not.  'Twas a general comment.  All I<br>am saying is that if a level 12 wanders solo into<br>a place like Solusek, you are stupid because you<br>OBVIOUSLY don't belong there.  But if you are in<br>an area that's widely considered acceptable for<br>a player at your level, then there is no issue.<p>: My death was coused by a combernation of an unlucky spawn combined with three of the party not joining in the fight till after I was dead (including the wiz who could have evaced). Case of sod's law more than anything (not complaining here, these things happpon).<p>I can certainly sympathize.  I think we all can.  :)<p>: [note: One small point I wasn't telling clerics for a res. I would however have liked the 40th level cleric who I had been hunting with for the last 4 hours to have been able to use his spell on me ;)]<p>And I wasn't trying to be accusatory... but there<br>ARE a large contingent out there that DO pile<br>their corpses and /tell every high-level cleric<br>they can identify.  The cleric in your party should<br>have done it... no matter how bad of a group I'm in,<br>I never abandon them in a bad position.  I stick<br>around until we're all safe and prepared, then<br>bow out.  I've even stayed on an extra three hours<br>to help retrieve a corpse (dying three times myself<br>in the process) of a random stranger I had grouped<br>with one night.  This is a matter of personal<br>ethics combined with a sense of civic duty.  I<br>try to keep good relations with everyone I interact<br>with, never know when one of them might be in a<br>position to bail me out someday. :)<p>: ------------<br>: : Resurrect is a high-level, group-oriented spell that helps a party recover lost members for reduced down-time. Why? Because at high levels, they've EARNED it. A high-level roup in a high-level dungeon can't afford to e down one or more party members for long. As reward for many levels of service, the cleric gains the ability to summon his companions back to their corpse. As an added bonus, they also begin to restore lost XP.<p>: : If you are venturing into more dangerous areas, and take risks, you are also assuming the responsibility and realizing the possibility that you MIGHT NOT survive, and further, you PROBABLY won't be able to retrieve your corpse without outside assistance<p>: At higher levels (when the two exp giving spells are avalible) you are almost always taking this risk. Higher level dungeons (from what ive seen so far) can be dagerous at any level, but a higher level party will almost always have to take these risks due to the nature of the places they have to get to in order to hunt.<p>: If it was simply a matter of down time which is the concern. Clerics would not need the higher level spells. The added mana cost alone would not be viable if not for the exp gain which you recieve (as this increases the down time).<p>I will defer to your greater experience at this<br>point.  I certainly haven't experienced more than<br>a small fraction of the zones and mobs that you<br>have, so I have a limited knowledge of what it's<br>like as you get further along in levels.  I'm sure<br>that as my cleric advances, my rose-colored glasses<br>will be removed. :)<p>: In my opinion the exp return is not a bonous it is a way for clerics to cheat death - bring dead back to life !. As such the higher level you are the better you are at cheating it (exp return as there is no permenant death in this game).<p>That's a way of looking at it that I hadn't<br>considered before.  If this is the case, I wonder<br>why the XP regain simply doesn't increase with<br>level?  I mean, many other spells have a X/level<br>component, particularly DD.  We could have a single<br>resurrect spell at 29 or 34, and simply have the<br>max XP restored ramp from 10% at 34 up to 90%<br>regained at 49... Why three different spells?  It<br>doesn't seem to me that either model (your idea<br>or my idea) fits exactly... a case could be made<br>for each.<p>: I do agree that the spell was designed primaraly for party use however and that is one of my points. I was grouped with a cleric (not that far above me) and more than pulling my weight in the party but could not gain benifit from his spell ?<p>I guess the issue really is a question of how long<br>the time limit can be before it stops people from<br>piling up corpses again.  I would say Verant took<br>a much too conservative first estimate with the<br>2 hour time limit.  I think in principal it was<br>a good rule to implement, just poorly tested,<br>poorly communicated, and in the end, not adequate.<br>Let's hope they are willing to reconsider it...<br>they haven't been in the past, on too many issues.<p>: ------------------<br>: :What they did was nerf this spell for the people that run around piling up corpses and asking clerics to resurrect them. What they IDN'T particularly nerf is the cleric that works as part of a solid team, and can help out his guildmates or groupmates<p>: Yes they have nurfed it for people running around pilling up corpses but they have also made it a lot more restrictive for party use. At Higher levels it can take more than two hours to get your corpse back (even if you do not have to contend with bugs as well).<p>: This is exaclty the point I am trying to make. I was partied with a good group, including a cleric capable of exp res. I handn't looted my courpse let alone pilled a few courpses by a zone. But was still not able to benifit ?<p>: ----------------------<p>: I hope I made it a bit clearer.<p>Much more so.<p>: As for my pearsonal situation, it took all of an hour at most to regain the the exp that would have been returned and after a few more hours im well on the way to 37. Im not complaining about my particular scenerio (I may have been at 2.30 am on thursday morning, but not now ;)).<p>: The point to this is that the nurf was supposed to stop draging corpes to zones for exp res (although it does nothing to stop people still using it as a corpse taxi service, which I would have though was far more abusive for this line of spells). But it does directly effect the number of situations it can be used in a party situation as well. As I understand it this was not it's intended effect.<p>: With regard to my referance about other nufs/changes. The dot spell for example was changed so that kitting (soloing yellows/reds) was made nufed, but in return there dot's now do more damage when used in a real party situation which is how they were intended.<p>: As I mentioned in my earlyer post there are far more effective ways to nurf this particluar aspect. Although as I said before these would also course complaints (as does any nurf). A simple way would be to auto loot corpses so that once looted there was no longer a corpse left. If you want a res then you cannot loot your courpse before you are actualy res'd.<p>Hmmm... I don't know... this seems almost as bad.<br>I wouldn't like to be the one stuck standing<br>naked by my corpse waiting for a cleric.  Could<br>spell disaster, depending on where you were, I<br>suppose.  Do you think this might start a new sort<br>of "twinking," whereby a person with a high-level<br>cleric character will simply park it in a dungeon<br>and bring in his low-level character and some friends,<br>and fight with relative impunity in a dungeon that<br>is normally much more difficult?  Even if they die,<br>you just bring in the cleric, res everyone, camp<br>out again.  The only drawback is that the cleric's<br>low-level player wouldn't be ressed, I guess...<br>I don't know what happens when a corpse is ressed<br>while the character is logged out...  I would guess<br>it would fail.<p>: Result no piling up of corpses by the zone and no corpse taxi service. But no time limit so if a cleric is at hand (in the party you are fighting with) you will be able to benifit from his spells. The downside is that if you have no exp returning cleric in your party you may not be able to get exp back (but surly this is better than not getting exp back when you are trying to use the spell as intended ?).<p>Hmm... this is probably a programming nightmare<br>though... consider that the 'stack' of items on<br>your corpse may not match where YOU think they<br>belong on your person...  I guess technically,<br>they do fall off from top to bottom, left to right<br>(I never paid that much attention before), so they<br>should be able to be stuffed back into your item<br>slots and inventory in the same order.  God knows<br>I hate having to pull all that stuff off my corpse<br>one item at a time.. that can take a long time,<br>and I'm not nearly as decked out as many people<br>are... I'm missing quite a few pieces of armor/<br>equipment.  I can imagine how it is for someone<br>that's got something in EVERY slot...<p>: As for /tell to clerics asking for reses. While I havn't been hamperd to much by this (not being able to give exp back yet), my party comes first and it's not offten im in a group that want's to go without it's cleric for long. If im not grouped, or about to leave a group ill res. if my party will suffer becouse of this I wont. While id always like to res people if asked or I see there in need (whatever my level) if my party will suffer for it I will not and people asking just need to realise that.<p>I'm in total agreement, but that doesn't stop<br>people from asking you, which can be a pain.<br>Even at my low level, I have had people ask me<br>to cross a zone just to cure disease.  Even if<br>I'm not grouped, it's often hardly worth my time<br>to do it.  I don't look forward to a day when I<br>can resurrect, and start getting requests to<br>travel several zones away to res someone.<p>Gorgrim<br>Servant of Underfoot<br>Prelate of the 14th Cloth<br>Tarew Marr
