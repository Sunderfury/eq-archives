            spots spawns a <em><strong>Ghoul Savant</strong></em>.&nbsp; He
            drops the <strong>black enameled mace</strong> as the common drop, 8
            damage 28 delay mace, and <strong>black enameled chestplate</strong>

            straight right and you'll enter a room with 4 jail cells and a
            platform in the middle.&nbsp; On top of the platform spawns the <em><strong>Ghoul
            Executioner</strong></em>, his booby drop is an <strong>executioners
            hood</strong>, 5 ac, plus 4 str plus 9 dex leather hat, very nice
            for rogue.&nbsp; His rare drop is of course, the <strong>executioners

            <p>Also to the right of the staircase you'll find a room with a book
            case in it.&nbsp; In there spawn the <em><strong>Ghoul Sage</strong></em>
            and <em><strong>Ghoul Scribe</strong></em>.&nbsp; The sage drops a
            belt, forget the name right now, that has 2 ac, plus 4 int, plus
            8hp, and a rare drop hat (forget the name), that gives 4 wis, 9 int.&nbsp;
            The scribe's common drop is a <strong>Parchment of Flayed Skin</strong>,
            most likely some quest item, and I don't know what his rare drop is.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"></p>

            <p>To the left of the stairs you'll find a room with 3 frogs and a
            bed in it, in there spawns the <em><strong>Ghoul Cavalier</strong></em>.
            His common drop are <strong>adamantite epolets</strong>, 9 ac plus 7
            wis plate based shoulders, and his rare drop is the <strong>Dark
            Reaver</strong>, a 20 damage 42 delay SK only slashing weapon, which

            <p>Also to the left of the staircase you'll find another room with 3
            frogs that leads to the lobby, which you can also get to by dropping
            off the bridge where the 3 tals are.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">
            <p>From the lobby, follow the path the hall and you'll get to a jail
            room with 4 cages, and 3 halls.&nbsp; If you go straight, you'll
            have to clear out about 10 frogs ranging from wans to dars and their
            mage equivalents. Very tough frogs. If you're good you can do these
            in pulls of 2.&nbsp; Keep heading in and you'll get to a long room
            with a trap in the center.&nbsp; Avoid the trap.&nbsp; If you do
            fall in, it just drops you down a bit, you can make your way back up
            the ladder NP.&nbsp; On either side of the trap there is a room.&nbsp;
            The left room has a pillar of water in it, swim up that and you'll
            find the <em><strong>Reanimated Hand</strong></em>, with 1 dar
            guard.&nbsp; The common drop off the hand are <strong>serpentine
            bracers</strong>, 1 ac, plus 3 dex, plus 9 agi, plate looking,
            awesome bracers.&nbsp; The rare drop sucks, <strong>adamantite band</strong>,
            plus 75hp, minus 10 magic resist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right room
            will lead to a ladder, not sure whats down there, and will loop back
            around into a little bedroom where the <strong>Ghoul Arch Magi</strong>
            spawns. His common drop are silver silk leggings, not sure on exact
            stats, but they have 4 ac and I believe some plus int.&nbsp; His
            rare drop is either a <strong>Robe of the Archmage</strong> or a <strong>Shiny
            Metallic Robe</strong>, don't have stats as I haven't seen this item
            myself, apparently it's great though.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">
            <p>Keep heading straight, you'll run into maybe 10 more frogs, and
            you'll get to the <em><strong>Ghoul Lord</strong></em>.&nbsp; Don't
            even attempt this without a full group of level 45+, or 2 full
            groups of levels 40+, this bugger is NASTY.&nbsp; Doubles for 125,
            Harm Touches for close to 500, and has over 8000 hitpoints.&nbsp; He
            also has 2 guards in his room, either dar knights, bok knights
            (level 43 to 46) or jin wizards (43 to 46).&nbsp; Fighting all 3 of
            these combined is basically suicide unless you have a killer high
            group, so you'll need to pull 1 of these solo.&nbsp; I'm not going
            to get into the intricasies of Aggro Radius pulling, but if you have
            a skilled puller he should be able to figure it out.&nbsp; The ghoul
            lord's common drop is a <strong>skull shaped barbute</strong>, a 13
            ac, plus 35 hp, plus 10 magic resist plate helm, and his rare drop
            is the <strong>Shortsword of the Ykesha</strong>, 8 damage, 24 delay
            1h slasher which procs ykesha, a 70 damage DD spell.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">
            <p>If you take the left path of the prison type room you get to some
            froglok slave camp, and if you take the right path you get to a
            serious maze like area with 40+ frogs crawling all over the place.&nbsp;
            This way leads to the <em><strong>Ghoul Sentinel</strong></em>
            (drops <strong>brigandine tunic</strong>) and the <em><strong>Frenzied
            Ghoul</strong></em>, which drops the <strong>flowing black silk sash</strong>.&nbsp;
            From what I've gathered this path is harder than the path to the
            ghoul lord, so you don't have a prayer unless you're with at least
            one full group of 45+.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></td>
