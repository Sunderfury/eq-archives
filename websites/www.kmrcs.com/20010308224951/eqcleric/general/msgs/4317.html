: : What about Sharks and the Sea monster of Lake Rathe?

: Never had a problem with the sharks, been green since lvl 22, haven't seen many in any case. Never seen the sea monster. I've swum over practically every inch of the Lake )

: My swimming is maxed out at 130 so I can swim to the island in about 15 seconds from the gnoll camp - it's not far - just out of sight from the dock at the gnoll camp.

: Also, while your swimming, hit your numlock to free up your hands, then use your RMB to move the screen until you are swimming with water at exactly eye level (the water line splits your screen in half). If you do this right, you can see below the water as if it weren't there.

: In any case, unless your swimming is really low, mobs in the water is not much of an issue since land is never very far away.
