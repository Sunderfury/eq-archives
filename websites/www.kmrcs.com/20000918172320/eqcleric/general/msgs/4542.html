Ok, listen...<p>It's obvious that dwarves are the only race they think about when adding new equipment. It's not an coincident that they forgot about dark elves when they made that new armor or added this new weapon.<p>They just don't think of the whole situation the dark elf clerics are in... Yes, we know, that was a typo bla bla bla. But this happened all the same time as they finally added a weapon which clerics can use to the game and made so that most races but the dark elves...<p>The whole picture here is like this, as a dark elf cleric<p>- we can not do cleric quests (bullsmasher for example)<br>- we can not use cleric equipment (butcherblock hammer for example)<br>- we can not alter faction by using a mask, like all other clerics can to come to our city (which could help them in their quests in our city, if we had any quests that is *smiles*)<p>...And now they "forgot" about us when making new cleric armor??? well excuse me but it seems like they totally forgot that there even ARE dark elf clerics in their game.........<p>/Patz

: Ok, listen...

: It's obvious that dwarves are the only race they think about when adding new equipment. It's not an coincident that they forgot about dark elves when they made that new armor or added this new weapon.

: They just don't think of the whole situation the dark elf clerics are in... Yes, we know, that was a typo bla bla bla. But this happened all the same time as they finally added a weapon which clerics can use to the game and made so that most races but the dark elves...

: The whole picture here is like this, as a dark elf cleric

: - we can not do cleric quests (bullsmasher for example)
: - we can not use cleric equipment (butcherblock hammer for example)
: - we can not alter faction by using a mask, like all other clerics can to come to our city (which could help them in their quests in our city, if we had any quests that is *smiles*)

: ...And now they &quot;forgot&quot; about us when making new cleric armor??? well excuse me but it seems like they totally forgot that there even ARE dark elf clerics in their game.........
