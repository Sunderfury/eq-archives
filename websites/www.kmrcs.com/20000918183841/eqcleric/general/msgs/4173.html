Lvl 30 35 40 45 are "hell lvls" simply because the xp required to advance is much more then a normal lvl.  And it seems each is progressivly harder.<p>This is just a guess since I am only lvl 35 (hell lvl 2) but it seems 30 was XPx2 and 35 is XPx3<p>When my enchanter hit lvl 35 and then had to be restored form a back-up a week old that is when I became discourged and starte my cleric.  My cleric is lvl 21 now...my enchanter although played about a third as many hours is still lvl 35 hehe. Man I love newbie lvls they are soooo damn easy.
