Except for a new look (yellow plate) doesn't seem like much to me. My Charred gloves and (soon) charred boots aren't likely to be replaced by these 2 things. Charred can be found on the same mob, has arguably better stats, and you don't have to buy 250p worth of plat bars THEN get it enchanted to be able to wear the item. <p>Verant screws up again.<p>Never will I understand why not have rubi spawning for those that want to camp it then have class specific armor quests for those that dislike the rubi camps.
