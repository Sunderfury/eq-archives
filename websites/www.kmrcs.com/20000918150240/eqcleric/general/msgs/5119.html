Why are we EVEN allowing people to who don't understand <br>the need of a cleric in their group to get under our<br>skin. Just ignor their posts and eventually they will go<br>away. If they think that a cleric is not need in a group<br>then so be it. Let them die, then when they come begging<br>for a RES, charge them a couple hundered plat. I know <br>shouldn't charge for it, but when you encounter IDIOTS<br>like this during game play it can be real fun. or do like I do, <br>put them on your ignor list. Hehe, pretty funny to watch them<br>for a heal when they are getting backstabbed for 200+ in Sol.<br>Anyway, this is a cleric site. Lets keep it that way. ignor the little<br>kiddys that try to flame. Enough said.<br>
