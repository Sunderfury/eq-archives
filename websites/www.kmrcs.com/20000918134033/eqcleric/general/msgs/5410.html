I totally agree with you.  I never was angry with Verant when I first started playing this game, but they have made me angry over the months.<p>I wish for once they would start telling the truth instead of lieing to us all the time.  Camp, camp, camp, camp, camp, and they make it worse by making the spawn times even longer.<p>I'm so sick of having to compete with other people for a kill in this game... a game that isn't even supposed to be a competition.  <p><br>
