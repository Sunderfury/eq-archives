: Logon at 6pm cst
: 615pm: While running through Rathe Mountains, help ranger boyfriend kill a named Cyclops of a part of a ranger quest.  Rangerboy tracks down Lianra, hail her, play with keyphrases, get part 3 of Reverent quest.
: 620pm: Zone into Lake Rathe, get excited because Turgan is on track.
: 640pm: Having tried every keyphase I could think of, and being told to basically &quot;get bent&quot;, kill Turgan and the chick with him (and noooo, they didn't drop anything)
: 650pm: Zone into West Karanas, pop some undead while rangerboy hunts for ghoul messenger.
: 655pm: Ghoul messenger is dead, Ranger boy has his quest note for the Short Sword of Morin.
: 700pm: Zone over to North Karanas, running the Northern Tree Line on the East side, looking for Zahal.
: 715pm: Still running, still looking (thank god Rangerboy has SoW now)
: 730pm: Shouting, Oocing, looking for Zahal.
: 745pm: Giving up, running to HPH to look for Jovan while Rangerboy goes to get his new sword in Kithicor.
: 815pm: Having checked all of the bars in HPH, deciding they must have meant Jovan was in HighKeep.  Zoning in...
: 820pm: Jovan is in the HK courtyard.  Trouble is, he's falling out of a doorway to the sky (I don't think he became a drunkard, I think his problem is a *bit* more serious).  Chasing Jovan, getting the correct keyphrase, finding out he wants a Tunpy Tonic.
: 822pm: Retrieved Tonic from Bank in HK (I have them for making trueshot bows... fletching FINALLY pays off!).  Hand it to to the Jovster, who promptly consumes it and passes out while handing me the icon.
: 840pm: Checking Befallen for named ghnomee necromancers.  Nothing.  Rangerboy stays up top due to lack of keys.
: 900pm: Waiting for boat in Freeport.
: 920pm: Waiting for boat in Freeport.
: 940pm: Hop off at Sister's island, starting the swim to the parrot/aviak island.
: 1000pm: Killing green aviaks.
: 1100pm: Killing green aviaks.
: 1115pm: Giving up on ever seeing Gull.
: 1130pm: Arrive in Butcherbock, heading for Dagnor's.
: 1145pm: Rangerboy gets another quest ranger quest piece off the first thing we kill.  Never did see that Bilge fellow.
: 1200pm: Killed Meldrath for another ranger quest item.  Oh joy.. Rangerboy has 1 completed quest, and half of two more, to my 1/3 of one (I consider enchanted plat bars a quest piece of their own - finding an ench for the job who won't rip you off being the hard part).
: 1215pm: Killed Mino Sentry on the respawn, getting the icon of the Devout.

: Ok, so for 6+ hours of questing, I have 1/3 of 2 quests completed.
: Rangerboy has 1 complete, and half of 2 more (1 of these being for the ranger quest tunic - 19ac, 3str 3wis).
: I've got my list, he has his.
: Half of his items are &quot;rare&quot; drops on regular mobs (I have yet to see or hear of them not dropping on the first one to die however).
: Cleric items are pretty much sounding like 6-8hr camps PER piece - and do remember that you need 1-2 ench plat bars per item.
: I need 10 enchanted platinum bars for 7 items.
: Rangerboy needs a sapphire and 2 rubies for 5 items.
: Does anyone else see a SLIGHT imbalance here?????
: I applaud the fact that Vernerf is trying to bring the QUEST back to EverQuest.  I thought running from one end of the earth to the other was gonna be a good time (Rangerboy having SoW and all now).
: God was I wrong.  I don't know how things are working out for the other classes, but it seems like the items I have heard about and seen are really good, and all you have to do is run around like a maniac.  I'm thinking that the lead designer or someone with very sadistic tendancies designed the Cleric quests... Running all over the world isn't enough for us, we need to set up camp and open a res store in the zone while waiting for the elusive Zahal who has a flute that belongs to some gypsy in Rathe Mnts, who used to be the love of a cleric names Regis the Reverent, who commited suicide due to the camps involved in slaying his arch-nemisis.
: I don't want easy, dammit, I want a reasonable reward for a reasonable ammount of time spent questing.
: BAH!!!!!!

: Juul Ekiloretu
: Cleric of Tunare - level 39
: Mistress of Fletching
: Veeshan Server

: PS - Most of the time spent on aviak island was either medding and watching Rangerboy kill stuff, or shouting that wizard's don't need to see Gull as all the new quest items seem to be NODROP, and the items they are made into are NODROP as well.  At least Vernerf seems to have realized there was a farming issue with crafted.
