I was with a group in the lower throne room in Cazic.  The other cleric and I were medding when a Justicar showed up.  Well, we started pounding on it but then it began to heal.  Somebody said, "that was a Superior Heal!", I said, "no it's the Page behind it, get the Page, Justicar's can't Superior Heal."  Well, they ignored me and kept pounding on the Justicar, meanwhile I was healing the party and trying to stun the Page.  the Page frenzied on me because of the heals.  Justicar runs off and the ENTIRE party (except me and the other cleric) go after it!  I'm trying to take out the Page, the other cleric sits down and says "OOM".  I start asking where everyone is and telling them to take this Page off me.  I also tell the other cleric to stand up and help me (he had an Observer staff and could do a lot more melee damage than I could, Page's aren't THAT tough).  Anyway, a gorilla spawns behind me and 2 more spawn outside the throne room.  The other cleric never stood up and the rest of the party never came back.  I had no choice but to gate out (luckily it went off).  Then I start hearing questions like "Where is everyone?"  I told them I gated because there were too many monsters to handle and where were they??  Some level 28 tank (I'm 35,btw) says "Stupid clerics" and I hear other remarks.  I hit Disband.<p>I told the other cleric to leave, they were going to get him killed if he stayed.  He refused.  Not too long after I hear the LTR shouting for someone to res their cleric.  I also keep hearing them shout for UTR to come help the LTR.  And later they keep shouting for healers (the other cleric left) and they never did recover from that.<p>Point of all this, it's not always your fault, I did everything I could to the best of my ability.  Sometimes it's best to ignore the offender and go on.. of course, they're now on my "Never to be XP Rezzed" list =P<p>BTW, TANKS TAKE CARE OF YOUR CLERICS!<br>
