I didn't know much when I picked my stats, so my character's wisdom is not that great for a high elf. Basically I made a well-balanced character, which was what I thought would match the typical cleric description.<p>So, if you maxed your wisdom, which is what most people recommend for a cleric, super-duper wis giving armor may not do you much good. But if your stats are balanced (ie not max wisdom), this armor would be great.<p>This makes me feel a little better, because I didn't think clerics were supposed to be big mana balls (at least thats not how I like to play mine).
