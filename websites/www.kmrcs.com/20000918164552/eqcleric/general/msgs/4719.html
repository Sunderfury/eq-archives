FWIW, it did NOT affect us with Verant (GZ doesn't mind people asking as long as they don't mind hearing no).  And for the record I purposely left Bash off the list (it was asked for).  If you think we took heat over some of the requested items (such as giving us the 10% back on Retribution), just imagine how asking for Bash would have been viewed.<p>FYI<br>Rayne
