: Here is how I would duel you with my enchanter.

: Mez (you stand there like an idiot)
: Tashani (bye bye Magic resist)

: Now here I have 2 options...
: Charm you and sick you on a red.
: Disempower, enfeedble, suffocate you to lower your STR by over 60 points and your AGI and AC some too (which is futhered by the fact you are probably overweight so bad you can no longer move).

: At this point I will get close and hope you are dumb enough to swing. Now my pet starts whacking you for 32 dmg, double attacking, kicking, and at a speed of 20 (I use real daggers not tarnished or rusty) At your non-dodging LOW AC butt. With alacrity on it to speed it's attacks 40% while I use tepid deeds on you to slow you down 40%

: While I sit there and pop you for 276 dmg a piece. And my DoT finished up its 200 DMG run.

: If you get close for some reason I color flux you...if my pet is dead I then mez you and meditate at 50% faster then most because I have clarity up. While I decide what I want to do next.

: At the same time you are screaming in fear on your end and cursing yourself for hitting the accept button.  If you are less then red I will kill you.....

: Citra 35 ENC/Bismol 21 CLR

: There is a reason verant is making debuffs, DD, DoT, root less effective in PvP.  It is because in a duel warriors always lose.

: Warriors have thier place in combat.  But without support they get thier asses handed to them.
