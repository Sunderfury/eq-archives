: : &lt;i&gt;: OK, I could swear I read that if you loot anything off your corpse you will not get any EXP back. Did anyone else see this. I even had a couple of friends tell me this. But now a GM is telling me that the only time you wont get back EXP with Rescucitate and Ressurect is:
: : : After the corpse is more than 2 hours old
: : : After the corpse is more than 10 minutes old after a duel.
: : : Can anyone verify this Please?&lt;/i&gt;

: : You will still get XP back from a Rescucitate even if the corpse is looted of all but one item.

: : Sometimes, if you Rez someone and they are in a different zone, they will not get the 'You have regained some lost experience' message.

: : In those cases, I just cast the Rez again, and since they're in the same zone, they've always gotten XP back.

: : If the corpse is over 2 hours old, I don't think they even get teleported to it.
