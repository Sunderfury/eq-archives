The best groups I've ever been in included an enchanter- not for clarity at all.  I've been in a group with one enchanter, on cleric (me) and 4 melee classes- never had a problem.<p>Enchanters, when played by a skilled one, allow your group to take on one MOB at a time.  They can also charm one of the other MOBs to become an extra for your party- still attacking one MOB (this gets a little harder as mes starts wearing off).  This "pet" also takes no experience away from the group.  Now, throw in a wiz/shaman/druid/mage and remove a melee class- Tashan line of spells reduces the magic resistance of the MOBs you are fighting, so that red that you just got ahold of and the prementioned DD/DOT classes can only get a couple of spells to stick: Tashan/i/ia and BING almost (or all) the spells are now hitting for max, or near max, damage.<p>Try grouping with an enchanter for awhile (there are enchanters don't play their class strenghts, just like there are clerics who don't play to our class strenghts- so you have to find one that really likes playing to the class strenghts instead of casting DD spells), you'll really enjoy the decreased healing you do :)  I always want one in my group.
