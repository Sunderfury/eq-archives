Depends on your level.  Not sure on the skeles down in the sewers.<p>I raised mine by running the Blessed Oil quest a couple times...<p><p>: I would like to do the Shining Star of light quest, but my faction with the priests in the temple sucks. What are the quickest ways of building faction with them? I've heard something about Bloodsabre Skeletons (how tough are they?) but that's about it.<p>
