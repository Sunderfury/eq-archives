Oh yea, cause rangers arn't seriously overpowered at all!  You aren't even supposed to be wearing plate.  By the way, nice plate ranger.  Like how those stats are better than mine even though I am supposed to wear plate.  Thats part of the balance of my class that you are ruining there.  Im sure you dont care though, you are one of those selfish, self-centered snots anyway.<p>
