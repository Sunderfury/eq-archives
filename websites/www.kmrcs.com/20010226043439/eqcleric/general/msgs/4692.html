Hey folks,<p>I'm a semi-new contributer to this list.   I had only started playing Tomma, when saw that there was a Cleric Petition going around.  I was mostly playing my Wizard at the time.  However, I do recall reading the petition, & wonder WTF is this bullshit?<p>The ONLY valid complaint I felt y'all had, was still being stunned during the duration of Divine Aura line of spells.  After all, how can you be knocked senseless, if your invulnerable??? <p>Now that I've played a Cleric well into her 20s, I've changed my thinking in regards to valid changes to the cleric class.  I still think that getting stunned while Divine Aura is cast, simply doesn't make sense. But, I have a new thought, & is a good one I think too.  Give Cleric's Bash.  It's a natural fit.  Most Cleric's use the mace/shield weapon combo anyway.  Let us put that shield to use!  It's not like Bash does enough dmg to be a balance altering difference anyway.<p>Also, have it be a base skill ratio like our current melee skills are.  (4 * level) + 5 = max.<p>Also, it's amazing that our dodge skill is capped at VERY GOOD.  This is purely stupid.  This should also, fit out max skill cap of (4 * level) + 5 = max.<p>Again, I reiterate these 2 changes would not change the cleric class tremendously.  However, it would just let us do our jobs a little better.  Our jobs is simple, keep everyone alive.<br>
