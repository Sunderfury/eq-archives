This is redicules, no one seems to know anything about the famous blued hammer! Folks, it is a one of a kind hammer which I have been working on for weeks now. From memory the stats are 23 dammage, delay 45 or maybe 50, and casts Invoke Lightening (a very powerful AE wizard spell, i think it does 125 dammage). It is a cleric weapon 2h Blunt and can be used by any cleric race (even DE's of which I am one). The problem is this, no one knows where the quest originates! So here is ALL that I know of:<br>1) go to Najena, speak to the Dark Elf mistress that spawns next the ogre captain (she is a cleric and is amiable to clerics ONLY). Now, after spending a few hours chatting with her, she wants 4 staffs of the ankehfex (sp?). As it turns out, these are the crystal staffs- Water, Ice, Fire and Slime which takes forever to get since the spawn rates on each mob are slow and they are high level. Then give her the 4 staffs and she gives you a note, which is illegible to me and only speaks of blue flames and neriak. Here is where I am stuck, there are no npc's at the blue flame forge to talk to about this...<sigh> Anyways, I have given a lot of information, the least a person can do is let me know of any additional info out there. Please don't post replies that "oh, this is a gm only quest" as that is NOT accurate, as a matter of fact, don't post anything if you don't know (i.e. Oh, i talked to my good buddy GM so and so and he said it's broken, or 'My friends father's son who has an uncle who's stepson works at verant and he said it is a gm only quest). Listen, I don't want to hear it. I have seen pictures of this weapon, and the person DID NOT get the item from a GM quest. Thanks. And I will post if I find any further info. I play on Vallon Zek (yep, I just love the thrill of always being on my toes and watching out for that li'l runt gnome who may lay my corps out....)<br>Kryms on vallon zek<br>Cleric
