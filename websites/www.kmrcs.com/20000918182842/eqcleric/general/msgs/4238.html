Thanks for the well commented and inspirational post.  I too enjoy playing my cleric (level 23 currently) and have found at times it can be very exciting and sometimes very annoying.  At my current level it is somewhat difficult (not impossible) to solo stuff.  The monsters that con blue to you usually hit fairly hard (attacked a blue deepwater croc in oasis last night and it was hitting around 40's occasionally).  Getting in a party can be fun but can also mean a long time to get decent xp.  But with your inspiration that might help me look past these few lower levels and move on to the more fun toward the end of the run.  Thanks again for the words of encouragement and best wishes to you on your travels to the great plateau (sp) of level 50 (temporary plateau).<p><p><p> I am hear to say that clerics are the best class in Everquest!  I reached my 44th blessing from Tunare over the weekend (I'm not trying to make anyone jealous, as several of my cleric friends have become), and let me give you my opinion on the class to this point.<p>: Clerics start out with some good buffs, decent melee, a couple of utility spells and bad damage spells.  This changes as you "age" and your favor grows with you chosen God.  Your buffs will get better, your melee worse, you will get a great mix of utility spells, and your DD spells will vary until you get Retribution at level 44(Wrath when you first get it is VERY nice).<p>: There are places that groups can not go without our power and blessing, because of this I feel that a cleric is a necessity in the world. Without a cleric, the hope of great experience and loot is dashed.  I have heard that there are times when a class that has an emergency group teleport (druid or wizard) is more important than a cleric.  I do not believe so in the slightest.  It is important if things go badly, don't get me wrong- I wouldn't go on a fire giant hunt, or deep into lower guk without one, but for the majority of the time that is not needed.  The only class that I would put near a cleric for tough zones or bad pulls is an enchanter, but the cleric-less group that has an enchanter will have large downtimes and most likely a death or two in a night.  If you have both cleric and enchanter, your group is truely gifted.  Clericless groups with an druid or wizard end up "evac"ing out very often as the shaman/druid can not heal nearly as effective as a cleric (for 5 levels this is not true- but don't let anyone else know this!).  Our God has placed us at the center of the group in a group-based game, for this I am truely thankful for my chosen profession.<p>: Because we are needed in virtually every situation, we are tied to the group that we help so much.  Well brothers and sisters, I am here to tell you that this becomes a fact of life for all children the Mother of All (Tunare) has created - to group with friends and have mighty adventures.  However, upon reaching the 44th level, Tunare has blessed me with a mighty array of tools to do what I wish, the rest of the tools have been made by our fellow man.  I can now take mighty Giants, Griffins, multiple specters, and many other creatures that would have made me run for my life, and put them to rest.  No class can effectively solo with regularity at higher levels effectively (gain the same experience you would in a group), however, I take great personal satisfaction that I can stand alone against these evils and protect those that need our protection from the giants, griffins, and specters.  I can also use the invisibility potion made by our fellow shaman (or the store bought ones) to sneak into strategic locations in the enemies hide-outs to bring Tunare's thunder down upon a particularlly evil enemy (walked right up to the goblin high shaman in Sol A, now my baby dorf warrior has a piece of crafted armor).  I have always felt needed and respected in a group, but the change of pace of being able to travel the world without taking precautions has made me a bit giddy.  I was also to experience the role of a wizard or other such class that can deal large amounts of damage, when our group ended up with 3 clerics, 2 tanks, and a necromancer.  This was another prespective I had not seen before.  I was looking at the monsters health, instead of my groups (all the while with nervous glances up at the party's heal status) and judging the oppenents we faced.  I spent the same amount of time medding, but it was different none-the-less.  And we make great "nukers" at this level (ooc- retribution starts at 496 damage- a level 49 wiz without Ice Comet does around 800 damage).  This was truely a great experience.<p>: Lastly, let me share that I have many brothers and sisters who have chosen other paths in life (ooc I've played a ranger, a bard, a necro, a monk, an *eekkk* druid (not for me), and am just starting a warrior), and many of those professions hold something special in their own right.  Many of them have different peaks and depressions in their careers.  I have often fought with inner turmoil at remaining the profession I was called to, and thanks Tunare each day for giving me the perseverance to remain true to my calling.  I believe that a cleric is the best balanced, most consistant class from day one until the point that I am at. They are probably the most well rounded of all the classes with the added bonus of coming into their "own" power very late in life.<p>
