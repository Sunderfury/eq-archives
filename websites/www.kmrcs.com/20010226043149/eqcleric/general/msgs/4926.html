In response to your response to a response from a response:<p>Get bent buttwipe. A lone lvl 9 enchanter lost in a strange land, finds the ideal kill. A white puma all alone. Some sexually confused, and perhaps self flagellant cleric(at least lvl 20+) Saunters up to witness the fight. The battle goes one way and then the other. The enchanter is fearing for her life and asks the cleric for help. Help! SHE CRIES. Does the cleric heal her? NO! The cleric actually takes the time to type: Muhuhuhuhaaaahahhahhaha... and then uses the dreadful smite spell on the hapless puma. Stealing the kill.  Clerics are useless. Not because of the skills they are given. No. it is because of the people that play clerics. They are socially awkward, glue sniffers, whose only wish in life, is to have control over other peoples lives. They cannot accomplish this in real life, living in their mothers basement, and stalking the neighbors 5 year old daughter or the cat. So they get on EQ and try to RP a life they can never have. A rich and full life of bringing health and peace to others. So they ask people for money when they heal them. They use "smite" and "res" as bargaining chips to get into groups that have no paladins or shaman or druids. Perhaps, Citra, you have a rose quartz gem, crammed in your ass crack. Perhaps you have spent time in the idilic land where kills are never stolen. Perhaps you just stay in the city and beat off to that EVERQUEST bitmap with the elven chick on the cover. Or perhaps you eyes are clouded with a glue ridden haze and smeared with a young girls feces. Clerics should be replaced with generous NPC's. Bring them orc belts or scalps and they can heal you. You smell, wash yourself and clear the stench that you bring to Norrath. Thank you for your time. And if you took any of this rant seriously, you miss the entire point of blackeye's original posting. <p>
