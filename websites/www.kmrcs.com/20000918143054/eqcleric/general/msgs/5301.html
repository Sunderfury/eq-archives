I helped a friend of mine complete the Short Sword of Morin quest last night.  As it is, it was a bit useless because at the end of the night another friend gave him a Ykesha (*cheers*).  Anyway, my point is that the ghoul messanger spawned about every 10 minutes.  Rangers were getting the sword in droves.  I think it's likely that Verant will decrease the spawn time on this mob and increase the spawn time on clerical items.  We can hope anyway.<p>Lucretia<p>
