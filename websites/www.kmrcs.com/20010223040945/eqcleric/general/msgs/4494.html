I'm glad you enjoy it.  There are some really good people who post here.<p>Concerning your calculations, I agree that you need to weigh it out, especially under level 25.  I always used 25 as the demarcation line because it is at this level that a +2 wis item = a +10 mana item.  I equate +2 wis w/ +10 mana because the items cost approximately the same for a jeweler to make.<p>At the extreme low end definitely take mana over wisdom.  However, once you hit 15 start considering a switch over and certainly once you hit the 20s I'd say switch, unless of course that mana item gives an <b>extreme</b> amount of mana.<p>A great example of an item that gives great mana is the Dark Mail Gauntlets (+50 mana).  No, wait, we can't equip them (grrr).  Zaharn's Coronet is pretty good, but I'd recommend the Runed Circlet for the long haul (never really need to replace it short of PoF stuff).  Observer's Staff is also very nice, but ultimately I think a Charred Guardian Shield is better.<p>Just my 2cp.<p>Rayne
