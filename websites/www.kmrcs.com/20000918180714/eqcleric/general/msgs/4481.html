I started as a Wizard, & ran him up to 27th level before I got sick of the typical root/nuke life style.  Plus, the 6 level resist limitations were killing me, in groups...  Everyone wants to fight stuff that's red, when yer in a full group...  That made me pretty useless amongst my friends,, since all I could do half the time, was just poke it w/ a dagger.<p>I selected cleric, because I wanted the opposite.  I didn't want to root/nuke.  I wanted to actually be able to help other party members, & I do a little bit of melee too.  <p>I'm 23rd level now, & will NOT go back...
