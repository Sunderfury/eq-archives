Your wisdom gear is better anyway. There will only be one or possibly two peices that give wisdom anyhow. I don't think anyone at 35+ plays a tank-cleric. All the new armor is pretty much melee based.<p>All the preistly classes(shamans, clerics, druids) have this nice list of "best" items. The new armor will only alter it by one or two items. Clerics actually have the best selection already with the ability to wear plate items. The Adamantite Epolets are easily one of the best priestly items in existance and clerics are the only ones who can use them.<p>Don't expect this stuff to replace your wisdom equipment. Its just something fun to do in your spare time if you feel like it. No one ever said that you must complete the quests or you are not a real cleric.<p>You can expect these quests to be expensive. They are geared for 35th level. 3000PP for a GREAT suit of armor is not that bad.<p>It does sound like you guys got the shaft on that ingot though. A +18wis staff AND a +5wis belt! That guy is gona be MEGA-camped. On the bright side, most people are interested in the wis items only, so you can probably arrange to loot just the ingot. There will also be plenty of help there to kill the guy!
