You can usually pull 2 or 3 of them at a time, but I've not tried this when Lord Grim is around.<p>The one time I was there with some friends to kill Grimmie, I just ran into the middle of the spawns and used Word of Souls until they were all running away :)  The rest of the party played clean up.  We never did get him to spawn.
