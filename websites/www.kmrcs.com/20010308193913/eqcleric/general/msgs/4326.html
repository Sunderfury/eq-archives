Test Server is in need of more High level competent players.  now, there have been some instances with transfers to test for testing purposes.  If any players are sick of the Over crowding, Camped, Unfriendly enviroment..  try out test for a while..  Give it a shot (run testeverquest.exe in EQ directory)<p>Now, if any players/guilds are wanting the change the test server offers, and are willing not only to play normaly but to become part of a tight knit community, as well as give their time to help test zones ect..  Give yer local GMs a tell and try working something out..  Chances are you will not get a transfer..  but it Can happen, with the right reason, and determination. <p>Now, the only reason i post this publicly, we only have 25ish lvl 40+ on test.  <p>Lower Guk, Sol B, PoF (thats a stretch, reason below)<p>1 - 2 groups in these places at most..  thats 6 - 12 people per high level zone..  No fighting over spots (for the most part)  no Whoring of Items.<p>Economy on test:  Good and bad..  Items sell for much less here, and are obtainable Much easier..  Bad: You cannot sell items for 2kpp like on regular shards :)  Take for instance..  hmm high level high sell price item on Prod shard,  Oracle robes?  150pp is a good price :p  <p>Ok..  anyhow :p  Call for help givin, this will most likely end up being a start a new char and build up senario..
