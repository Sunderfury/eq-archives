It is completely random. I did the quest 9 times before I got Bull Smasher. I have heard of some people doing it up to 20 times before they got it. Faction doesn't have anything to do with it. I was indifferent when he gave it to me. It is well worth the effort and time it takes to get it however. I am a lvl 16 dwarven cleric and I'm still using this weapon, although I will have to get rid of it sometime soon and get a magical weapon.<p>Ainvar<br>Dwarven cleric of the 16th season.<br>Brell Serilis<p><br>: I'm trying to get the Bullsmasher in Ak'anon.
