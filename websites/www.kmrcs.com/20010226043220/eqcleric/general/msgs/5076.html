Sure, nobody is ever expected to pay for the costs of a magician's pet, but if our magician ever asked me to pay for it, I would gladly give it up.  5sp is not going to break my bank.<p>However, at high levels peridot costs anywhere between 9pp to 11pp.  There's a slight difference there.  <p>I have had a variety of responses to the symbol issue.  I have had people show up in my group giving me the stones, extra loot turns, or just straight out cash.  In those situations, I cast when I've got mana.  It really depends on my current bank account how generous I am with the stones (if I was to do it for free).<p>~ren<p>BTW, I refuse to post on some of these posts by people obviously trying to inflame us. I would encourage you guys to do as well.
