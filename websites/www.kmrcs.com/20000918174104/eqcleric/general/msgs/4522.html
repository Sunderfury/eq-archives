: with this DE crying. PoF armor was a typo and will be fixed (eventually). If you are invited on a PoF mission, make everyone aware of this and that you will be in line for cleric-only armor. No one should have a problem with this.<br>: Please list here the number of race AND class specific quest. Not alot are there?  Why do you think DE clerics are so special that they should get quest specifically for them? Dwarven clerics dont...High elf clerics dont...gnome clerics dont. But DE cleric should huh?<br>: Complaining about a lack of quest in genreal is one thing....complain out the lack of quest avaliable to your specific race AND class borders on selfishness.<p>your city has plenty of quests in the other guilds, if not the clerical guild.  i'm sure bloodforge armor is totally useless to you :P<p>-OrkinMan
