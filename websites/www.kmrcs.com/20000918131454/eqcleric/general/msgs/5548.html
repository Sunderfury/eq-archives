 The real reason is not becuase of the AC bonuses, stat bonuses, etc. I'm sure there are some nice pieces we could all use. The real reason is because of the VERY slow spawn times. I'm a 31st Cleric, and waited in Kithicor woods the other night for 2.5 hours, waiting for the note from Regis to spawn. Nada. A friendly cleric showed up and informed me that I was in the correct spot, because he had already done the quest and retrieved the boots. I have better things to do with my time than stare at a piece of dirt for 4-5 hours waiting for a note, then running to a stump and waiting another 4-5 hours for the other item to spawn.<br> Now, if it were 4-5 hours of running, fighting, solving riddles, etc. for only the one item, I would be fine with that. That is a quest. Staring at a patch of dirt for 4 hours is not.<br> I also searched and searched for the beast in the underwater caves. Nada. Searched for Zahar the Vile. Nada. Everything is on this awful 4-5 hour spawn rate. It is ridiculously boring, especially when you hear someone trying to auction a no drop item they just happened by and picked up. AARGH!! Another 4-5 hour wait because some one picked it up not knowing what it was... Grrrr....<p>Brad, Verant, let us Quest for the armor! Not stare at a patch of land for 8-10 hours per piece!!<p>:ends his ranting and raving.<p>Nolam Ad'Amicus<br>31st Priest.
