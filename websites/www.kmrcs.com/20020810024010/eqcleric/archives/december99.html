          <blockquote>
            <p>I'm really interested in other people's experiences in that
            place.&nbsp; I've been there a half dozen times, and must admit I
            have mixed feelings about it.&nbsp; On one hand, I love the fact
            that it is relatively empty.&nbsp; After numerous nights of 90+
            players in LowerGuk (makes things a tad bit crowded) it's nice to
            have a zone with less than 20 players in it.&nbsp; On the other
            hand, I think the reason it has so few players is the risk/reward
            ratio is really really bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The behavior of that dungeon is very different now than it was
            before the revamp.&nbsp; It's one thing to leave numerous clusters
            of four or more mobs up when they are level 9 or so and do not aggro
            once green.&nbsp; It's another to do it when they are all &gt;20,
            usually &gt;25-27.&nbsp; It is quite frequent to open a door and
            have 7 or more mobs pour out at you.&nbsp; Granted, there are ways
            around this but the drops really don't justify the effort.&nbsp; An
            8 dmg, 31 delay 1hs sword is really not very special when handed to
            a level 40 Warrior.&nbsp; And a lower level group might have some
            difficulty acquiring it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Pathing is very screwy in this place.&nbsp; For example, I tried
            to do a pull (I was the tank, hehe) and Pacify failed on the
            greenie, all 5 came (nice for a level 39 spell eh?).&nbsp; I took
            the mobs away from the group and dove into the water (we were
            working the snake pit near the Judges/Executioner spawn).&nbsp; I
            then swam to the middle of the pond, where the pillar is.&nbsp; At
            this point I had 4 Gadulian (or however it is spelled) snakes on me.&nbsp;
            No problem, I gated out (with 200 spec alt you'd be amazed what you
            can gate out through).&nbsp; The snakes then teleported up to where
            my group was.&nbsp; <b>Nobody</b> tried to heal me or anything yet
            the snakes went there.&nbsp; Very odd.&nbsp; When I come back in all
            four snakes are at the zone line (huh?).&nbsp; An hour later they
            are still there.&nbsp; I sat invis'd and watched them sit there for
            5 minutes with nobody going through, yet they never moved.</p>
            <p>The point of this is Paw could be a great dungeon, but more work
            must go into it.&nbsp; I have not been there enough to claim to have
            all the answers, so I am very interested in hearing other people's
            experiences with it.&nbsp; Please post any thoughts/experiences
            about Paw on the General Board.</p>

              <p>Hello Jack,
              <p>We're still discussing issues related to the rarity of
              class-specific armor components for several classes (clerics
              included). I jumped the gun a little when I said &quot;the next
              patch&quot;, as only a few spell-related items were to be patched
              on December 14. The rest of the data, which includes updates to
              class-specific armor rarity, among other things, won't be going in
              until after the holidays.
              <p>My apologies for getting everyone excited prematurely.

            <p>Finally!&nbsp; I had an opportunity to visit the re furbished
            Splitpaw Saturday night and it was a blast.&nbsp; While at level 40,
            many areas of the zone were green, it was all blue deeper inside.&nbsp;
            Furthermore, everything was blue or higher to a level 33 in our
            group.</p>
            <p>We didn't get an opportunity to camp all the named mobs, but we
            did manage to pick up a few items:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Gloves, AC4, +3 Dex, +2 Wis and, best of all, wearable by
                clerics (among others)</li>
              <li>Vac Ra Vim - 1hs, 8 dmg, 31 delay, no drop</li>
              <li>Snakeskin mask: AC3, +5 vs Magic, +5 vs Poison, quite
                disappointing actually, but it was an additional drop to the
                sword listed above.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most importantly, none of the items listed above were from named
            mobs.&nbsp; Instead they were from various mobs throughout the zone.&nbsp;
            I'm reasonably certain that the sword, for example, is dropped in
            more than one place.</p>
            <p>I expect to have a much more complete report in a few days.</p>
