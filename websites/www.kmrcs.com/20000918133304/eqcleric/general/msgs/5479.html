By being no-drop, at least we won't have the problem rogues are having -- wizards killstealing all the lizzies and then trying to sell the armor to the rogues...  And this will keep the druids from doing our quest and taking our once a week spawns too!<p>: K i may be wrong but from what i have seen, Crafted (warrior only) Raven scale (rogue only) and the bard armor is all lore. Well from what o hear almost all the quest armors are lore. But cleric armor is Lore none drop i just dont get it. What can other classes get nice detailed quests and able to trade and sell what they get why they force clerics and im sure few others to slave away to get armor. I dont know im pissed off and i cant stand this pop rate on the quest items. They had a great idea but they messed up hard core on how they decided to time repops, and makeing the mobs so hard to find and kill. <p>: thats the way i feel anyone else have any insight<p>
