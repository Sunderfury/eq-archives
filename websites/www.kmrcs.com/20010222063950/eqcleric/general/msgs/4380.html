Hrmm, the thought of being powerleveled up sounds great - however there comes problems with that.  If I should accept a position of doing something like that and get power levelled up to a suitable level to be useful in your situation, I would also need to have somebody teach me the best ways to play the class for the maximum benefit.  So far I have been levelling along and learning new tricks & such and new experiences, but I'm afraid that if I were powerlevelled up a bunch of levels, I wouldn't know what to do properly in different places.  As far as the other friends I play with 1 is a level 22 druid (will be tonight anyway) and the other is a level 15 (working on 16) erudite wizard.  As far as leaving them in the dust, well some times you have to make sacrifices & such but I do have my warrior character that I can play with them.  He just hit 16 last night.  If you want to give me more details & such about what we would be doing, you can email me at RJaswal@fcmail.com or find me ingame on Dalur or Martyr (warrior).<p><p><br>: Basically right now most of us are in Lguk which you are not ready for HOWEVER we need clerics in there is a possibility you would be power-lvl'd to a suitible level for Lguk quickly =)<p>: Of course unless your friends are clerics(as primaries)...they will not be power lvl'd. (not even my cleric was power lvl'd...it is secondary...and neither was my enc).  So there is a chance you will leave your friends in your dust.  But you can power lvl them when we are done lvl'ing you.<p>: Basically right now we are in the middle of a house keeping phase.  Our very first one.  We found oursleves to have strayed from our goals a bit....and one was to have clerics.  It's sad but we are SOO low on clerics it isn't funny.  When we looked for our main problems that was one of the 2 major items. We have TONS of paladins tho =)<p>
