Well I guess that's a personal choice.  I personally like the dwarf look.  I am human 24/7 in real life so it's a refreshing change to play something different.  My str is 95 unmodified & my wis is around 140 (give or take a little - haven't checked lately).  Level 23 BTW.<p><p>: I play a Human Cleric, too...  I never would've become a Cleric had I been forced to be a Dwarf. <br>: Not having to look like a Dwarf, is reward enuf for me.  <p>: I'm 22L now, & have my Sense Heading level maxed. <p>: With Jewelry assistance, I have a 98 STR, & a WIS in the 140's.   I wear full bronze, except on the wrists. (2 PBB's)<p>: Did I mention, that I don't have to look like a Dwarf?  Plus, my AGI doesn't suck, & my CHAR isn't half bad either.  <p>: I was a little disheartened, when I saw the specifics on the Butcherblock Hammer, & it's GNM & DWF only. <p>: It has excellent dmg stats.  Good enuf that'd I'd give up my CIMS & Mistmoore Shield for it.  But ya know, at least I don't have to look like a Dwarf.<p>: Tomma Trueheart<br>: 22L Cleric of Mithaniel Marr<br>: Tarew Marr<p>
