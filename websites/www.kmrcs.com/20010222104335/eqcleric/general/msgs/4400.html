: Their complaints are:<p>: <li>The spells after Snare are not as good, so they want them upgraded<p>Druid Response :<br>Incorrect. I believe that the petition was that we have spell upgrades that are useless.  (Snare is later upgraded to ensnare.  However, ensnare is not as good as snare, which makes it a useless upgrade.  Our root spells also go up ensnaring roots, grasping roots, etc.  These also are not effective upgrades.  They cost a LOT more mana then the basic root, do pitiful damage, and do not last ANY longer then the basic root (which is not very long).<p>: <li>Evidently they get attacked by a charmed animal after the charm wears off.  No comment</li><p>Druid Response :<br>Yes we do.  It is annoying for us to get charm spells and yet not have the CHA or whatever to make them last for longer then 45 seconds.  It ends up that these spells are used for novalty and bordom rather then as a tactic in battle.  If these spells actually lasted a minumum of say 2 minutes (with the same random length after that), they would then become useful as a tactic.. even if they were made to be resisted twice as hard as they are now.<p><br>: <li>They want their DoTs restored to the previous behavior and damage.</li><p>Yes.  Why do you ask.  Simple.  Because the "extra tick of damage" is NOT implemented.  We do NOT get more damage standing still.  This has been tested MANY TIMES.  If we cast it on a creature where the HPS are known and stand there and let the mob hit us, it now does 2/3 the damage it used to.  So yes, we want it back the way it was.. because it is obvious they lied.<br>-----------------<p>Other druids want things that ARE unreasonable, like permanent wolf pets for example.<p>I would actually like to see a few druid changes myself:<p>1> A ring Surefall Glade (teleport) and a Circle Surefall Glade (group teleport)<p>2> A Succor Affinity spell (Group emergency teleport to the Druid's bind spot)<p>3> A Werewolf Form at high levels (It is obvious that the graphics are in place for this since enchanters get a werewolf illusion.. so we druids would like it VERY MUCH)<p>4> A 44th level Heal Spell (call it Nature's Gift or something that gives 550hp for 300 mana. - Making it less mana efficient then superior healing, at a higher level, and gives us druids the ability to save your cleric's butt when the fit hits the shan.)<p><br>But to tell you the truth, I like my druid fine the way he is.

: -----------------

: Other druids want things that ARE unreasonable, like permanent wolf pets for example.

: I would actually like to see a few druid changes myself:

: 1&gt; A ring Surefall Glade (teleport) and a Circle Surefall Glade (group teleport)

: 2&gt; A Succor Affinity spell (Group emergency teleport to the Druid's bind spot)

: 3&gt; A Werewolf Form at high levels (It is obvious that the graphics are in place for this since enchanters get a werewolf illusion.. so we druids would like it VERY MUCH)

: 4&gt; A 44th level Heal Spell (call it Nature's Gift or something that gives 550hp for 300 mana. - Making it less mana efficient then superior healing, at a higher level, and gives us druids the ability to save your cleric's butt when the fit hits the shan.)

: But to tell you the truth, I like my druid fine the way he is.  Even as a human druid (yes I get teased by the halflings a lot :P).

: Too bad on your petition I think that the divine aura SHOULD NOT be stunned (or at least the higher level version should not).  Oh well...

: This is a lurking Druid,

: Bidding adieu.
