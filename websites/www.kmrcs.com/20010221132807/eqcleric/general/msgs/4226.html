At 15 maybe you are rather broke.  If I were you I will..<p>1. Full your spell book - always the priority, 70pp maybe<br>2. Golden Jasper earring - ~70pp a pair and you can use this til you 50<br>3. Lizardscale mantle or cloak - ~40pp serve till 35/50 i think<br>4. Shining Brass Shield - ~30pp nice shield save you from root<br>5. Screaming mace - ~100pp but i'll go get it myself :)<br>6. Saving - better hold some cash for your 19 spells.<p>Bronze.. you can get some if you find them real cheap, such as 25pp - 5pp depends on bp or gorget.  Don't buy them high as you will get A LOT of them when you are 25 to 30.<p>Ob staff? 5 wisdom and the mana is nice but 2h blunt isn't the final way to go. Don't worth to invest all your money in a future bank junk.
