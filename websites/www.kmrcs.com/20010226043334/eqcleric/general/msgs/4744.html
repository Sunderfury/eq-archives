I have had a few reports of people logging off immediately after death in frustration and when getting back on they are unable to be ressurected.  Now either the time limit is 2 hours RL or there are some bugs with the time limit... anyone else have more info on this?<p>On another note... I personaly hate the new limit.  I feel that the limit needs to be increased to 4 hours or for the first 2 hours the person can be ressurected from anywhere.... after that they have to be in the same zone as their corpse for ressurection to work.<p>One of Verant's 'reasons' for the time limit change was to prevent people from getting a 'teleport' effect by leaving corpses everywhere and getting revived to that spot. Having to be in the same zone as your corpse after the 2 hour period would effectively negate the 'teleport' effect and give us a longer period for ressurections. This second period would need a limit as well inorder to prevent the massive piles of corpses laying around but I feel an additionaly 2-4 hours on top of the first 2 hour (res from anywhere) period would not be unreasonable.<br> <br>ramblings of a drunken cleric,<p>Kaldaur
