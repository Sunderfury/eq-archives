: Guess what, that level 50 wizard probably has friends. All they need to do is group with 5 other level 5 friends and that 10th level cleric gets all the No Drop armor he wants.

: Face it. If there is a block in the roadway of Online RPGs there is a dirt road already being blazed around it by someone.

: This post isn't meant as a flame to Haldaar. I am simply stating that No Drop isn't all it is cracked up to be.

: I am a level 50 and now I get to go around camping all these items with lower level clerics and why? Wouldn't it be nice for me to give a high level magic item in a trade to a medium level cleric that did the camping and got a second set of an item?

: The only No Drop that can't be &quot;twinked&quot; is Plane of Fear armor.

: In general I don't mind camping and I don't mind no drop items, niw that they can be banked. On the other hand, to keep class balance ALL class specific armor should be the same, all No Drop or all tradeable armor. IMO, Verant should stay consistent in these situations.
