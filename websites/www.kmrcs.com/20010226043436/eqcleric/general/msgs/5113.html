: I don't know if you can do them or not, but have you seen if the Dismal Rage in Freeport will allow you to do thier quests? I am a human follower of Innoruuk and get a few quests from the people there. I have never tried to see if a tier'dal was able to recieve them or not.<p>Aye, the Dismal Rage will employ Dark Elves to run their errands. But, some of them require traveling through Freeport so if you are truly evil and hunt guards as I do you will not be able to do some of the quests. If you have good faction with Freeport you shouldn't have a problem. Theres a great story line behind the quests too. The Mayor and the Dismal Rage are both trying to take over Freeport through deception and corruption.<p>Atos En'Nim<br>Darkmoon High Priestess<br>Xegony
