Conversly the +6 wis earring from the Lynuga quest is forbidden to Dwarves.  Some of the exceptions seem more like data enter errors than intention.<p>: Why in the name of (fill in your deity here) were Halflings, Gnomes, and Dark Elf clerics exempt from being able to wear the Plane of Fear Armor?  I realize there are not a lot of us out there compared to you Dwarves and High Elves, but explain to me the reasoning for us being shafted on the best Cleric armor in the game??????   If I would have know this when I created my character, I might have chosen a different race.  Why is it Verant never has the balls to give a popular race/class the shaft?  If certain races are to be exempt, at least give me a decent story-line or justification for this.  Jesus.  What a bunch of BS!!!!!!<p>
