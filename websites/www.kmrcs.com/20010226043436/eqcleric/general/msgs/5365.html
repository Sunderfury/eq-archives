I'm playing on Fennin Ro and I play out of Qeynos.

At Lvl 6 I'm not yet quite strong enough to take on a Queen Klicnik by myself or a Rabid Grizzly so I am limited to mostly the Gnolls in Black Burrow however they don't give much experience.<p>I wear patchwork armor and banded armor.  The patchwork I bought from someone and the banded a barbarian gave to me after I healed him when he was hurt badly during a messy melee.  I could NEVER afford banded armor on my meager funds so I do watch my HP level too and if I see I am running low on health, I bolt.  I use a mace (I forgot what kind exactly but it does 5 points of damage itself) and on each swing I do about 10 to 12 points of damage.<p>I play EQ when I can.  I don't play every day.  I play usually three to four times a week for three to four hours.  <p>Now... can anyone, based on that bit of info, help point me in the right direction so I can make my character level faster and become stronger and a better Cleric?  :)

: I'm playing on Fennin Ro and I play out of Qeynos.  I usually hunt in Qeynos Hills and BB means Black Burrow, where the Gnolls hang out.

: Most of what there is to hunt here are:  Klicniks, Gnolls (different kinds), wolfs, bears, and some skeletons.  

: That's about it.

: I've tried grouping but as I said in another post, groups generally don't work as they go their own way.  At Lvl 6 I'm not yet quite strong enough to take on a Queen Klicnik by myself or a Rabid Grizzly so I am limited to mostly the Gnolls in Black Burrow however they don't give much experience.

: I wear patchwork armor and banded armor.  The patchwork I bought from someone and the banded a barbarian gave to me after I healed him when he was hurt badly during a messy melee.  I could NEVER afford banded armor on my meager funds so I do watch my HP level too and if I see I am running low on health, I bolt.  I use a mace (I forgot what kind exactly but it does 5 points of damage itself) and on each swing I do about 10 to 12 points of damage.

: I play EQ when I can.  I don't play every day.  I play usually three to four times a week for three to four hours.  

: Now... can anyone, based on that bit of info, help point me in the right direction so I can make my character level faster and become stronger and a better Cleric?  :)
