When I did it I got invited into a guild hunt (they needed a cleric ;)) there were two full parties doing the hand and AM. Most of the others were red to me, with a couple of yellow's. Towards the end of the night, when we got down to about 1 party we ended up evacing. Mobs were coning anyware from blue to red for me.<p>Wouldnt like to do this in a single 35 party either. Although the place is normaly camped out so it's probably easyer than when you first camped it Badaf.
