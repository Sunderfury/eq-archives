: Ok, to start on.  None of the new quest are going to be easy, except the Boots of Reliant quest.  That is the ONLY one that has both items needed dropped on the group.   Boots are a Light Gold color, 9AC +6 vs Disease.

: Ok, the rest of these quest.  Allmost all are linked to two areas, such as one has you kill an Aqua Gob in Runnyeye and one in Dagnors Cauldron.  Some have the Ingot spawn on the ground somewhere and the Icon on a mob somewhere.  The lvl of the Mobs that have the Icons / Ingots are all lvl 24(if not 28) to 45ish.

: Atleast we think 45ish:  a &quot;Huge White Beast&quot; in everfrost under the river in the caves..  which we know there is a lvl 47ish Wizzard in there that is Agro (we killed him, was a very tough fight with only 4 people..  and all he has is a Aprentice Robe :p) The reason i say this Polar bear is lvl 45ish is because I beleive it is of the same lines as the Giant Polar Bears in Permafrost (ya we had 2 groups fall in a trap near Vox with 8 of em :/)

: Ok, so none of the quest are easy, Spawn times on items an the mobs (which are rare so they have a chance not to spawn) is 6 - 12 hours estimate..  They are LORE/NO DROP, the finished product is LORE/NO DROP as well.

: I got the Ardent quest done tonight.  Gauntlets of the Ardent, Light Gold, 10AC +5 AGI +5 vs Cold.

: ------------------------------------------------------
: Now, onto other things..  New armor for every class.  Rogue armor found in Cazic is a black chain/plate look to it.  Bard armor from the Temple of Ro looks like this.

: &lt;IMG SRC=http://members.home.com/badtodd/BARDARM.JPG&gt;

: All the quest are seeming Hard..  Bard quest uses new Shin and Ice armor..  Shin armor found off shin ghoul knights, and Ice found off the Elite Ice gobs in Perma..  along with Lambent Stones, Which do not sound that easy to get..  

: SK quest are going in MistMoore, Blackish plate i think.  not sure what is needed to find em, but along the lines of Crafted Quest.   No idea on Monk and Shaman yet..  Rangers is getting some Green Chain sometime soon, just not sure when.

: Welp, bout all i can think of.
