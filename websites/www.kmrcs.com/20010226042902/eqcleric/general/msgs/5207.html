I just sat in the Scryer room checking BOTH water pillars ("the one on the right" depends upon which way you are facing, towards the Scryer or away - I was assuming towards but ya never know ;]).<p>Anyway I sat there for an hour and it didn't spawn and wasn't there when I got there =( Looks like we're in for some long respawn times and boring hours spent staring at some walls. To add insult to injury the Tashania Coins spawn every 5 minutes (Gee I wonder which will be more sought out).<p>Anyway, maybe the Ingot/Icon spawns in a random location underwater in Upper Guk. Probably not though, looks like the lame 6+ Hr respawn rumors were right, yay ...<br>
