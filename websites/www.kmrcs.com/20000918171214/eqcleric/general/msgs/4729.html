It IS sad, Elessara.  We wouldn't be clerics if we weren't in it for the jollies of helping out.<p>I have noticed a (growing?) trend in... hmm... immature players who are soloing to level quickly.  They see you and your group, so they pull their stuff nearby, knowing you will help if they yell.  They do it repeatedly.  They are usually way too young to be where they are, especially solo.  But they know we clerics are suckers for a low health bar and if we help, they can kill yellows and reds and level really quickly solo.  And I usually DO help out, even these guys (yeah, I'm a sucker), unless my group is engaged.  But if the guy brings too much and my group starts getting hurt, or the guy starts yelling or being even a tiny bit abusive, he gets shut out.  And I warn everyone else around too.  Sometimes it takes a /shout to get the moron to quit it, but eventually they go away.  And honestly, while I never like to see anyone die, a death-while-everyone-stands-by-and-watches in these cases is a well-deserved lesson in the perils of selfishness (and brings a tiny smirk of satisfaction to my lips... Tunare, forgive me!).<p>Maaggie<br>of Xegony<p>: I've gotten a couple of those comments as well .... which annoyed me so much, that if someone wasn't yelling for help and I can't actually see them, I don't bother trying to help anymore.  Which is sad because I do like helping people, but there is only so much idiocy you can take.<p>
