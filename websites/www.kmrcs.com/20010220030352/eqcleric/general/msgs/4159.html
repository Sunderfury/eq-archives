In the West Karanas (don't ask me where; someone in our party has the /loc and takes us there) is an Ogre camp.  The main honcho of that camp is an Ogre Shaman named Chief Goonda.  Goonda is level 34 and as all shamans can be kind of nasty.  He has sow, he casts DOTs, he hits very hard, etc.<p>As part of the camp there is another Ogre Shaman (not named) that is in the mid-high 20s (blue to me at 32).  He is the one that drops the Chipped Bone Bracelet.  Goonda drops the Sheerbone mask and a +5 Int earring.<p>I'm not sure what the visiting priestess drops (an occasional spawn) as we've never looted her.<p>The rest of the guards are low-mid 20s, but there are 3-4 more.<p>As far as holding that camp with a mid-20s group I kind of doubt it.  I really don't think that kind of group could break it, and even if it was already broken you have to have a few people in the group who could handle Goonda.  I could, of course, be mistaken about your capabilities.<p>I hope this helps,<br>Rayne, Karana
