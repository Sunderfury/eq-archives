Depending on how long I play, I get booted (I'm talking either server not responding message, to total computer lockup) at least 1x per night.  I don't think it matters what you are using to connect to the internet.  I use a 56k modem and usually connect around 48k.  My friend runs a DSL connection and he got booted 5 times last night.  He says he gets kicked usually 1x per night also.  <p>: I am getting sick of this!!  Ok, this isn't a Cleric specific question but it has to do with EQ and I'm sure someone else here has run into to this.<p>: Whenever I try to play EQ, I first have to bypass about 10-20 "Could not log into the chat/log-in sever.  Try again later" messages.  After it finally allows me in and I get into EQ, sometime during my game, I will lose my connection.  This NEVER fails.  EVERY SINGLE time I have played EQ I have lost my connection AT LEAST once; usually more than that.  Last night I lost it five times--twice in BB.  I was lucky that I was actually with a friend I knew and the area just happened to be quiet or I might've been Gnoll-chow.  <p>: I used to use EarthLink to connect to EQ which in my opinion sucks because at the time I was using a 56K modem and it wouldn't acknowledge the speed.  The best speed I could get was 28.8 on the internet and EQ.  I figured THAT was the reason for my problems.<p>: WRONG!  I now have Cable Modem--and although I move like lightning on the internet and everywhere else online, on EQ I still lose my connection JUST AS MUCH AS BEFORE.  Nothing has changed!!<p>: I want to know if anyone has experienced this!  It's become very annoying!  I'm afraid to take my character out hunting anywhere because I KNOW I'll get disconnected (and I do) I just don't know when and where.<p>: Anyone have any ideas what I can do about it?  And I don't know if this matters any but I play on the Fennin Ro server.<p>
