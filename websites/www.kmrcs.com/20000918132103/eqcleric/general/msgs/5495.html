: The reasons people are complaining:

: Before the patch good armour in the form of Ruby was availible in Cazic. This armour allowed you a chance of getting some very good AC armour (or rubicant effect on the BP) while camping mobs that both gave exp, an occational challange and generaly good loot (of the other lizards).

: The main downside to this was it was gernaly well camped (although no more than any other med - high level spot ive been to) and that to stand a half decent chance at getting Ruby you needed to camp all weekend ;)

: After the patch this armour has been removed.

: The new zone is simply a zone full of NPC handing out quest's. Even though there are constant requests for more high level areas to hunt.

: The quests (ill stick with cleric ones) involve:

: Travelling to differant areas (not a problem and one of the easyest ways to impliment quests).

: Camping rare spawns that give little/no exp to a lot of clerics who would like to get this armour. No chalange and no real fun.

: Camping bag spawns on the groud. Ok I can't imagion this is considered fun by anyone ;)

: If you want to quest for these items seriously it involves a lot of downtime travelling, and sitting around twidling your fingures. Not rearly very much in the way of an exciting quest is it ;)

: Personaly Im not rearly bothering with it, I dont like waisting my time on doing this sort of thing (I preffer to group up and have some fun instead). Ill probably stop by the spawn sights if im in the area, and maybee ill get lucky ;)

: Basicly the feeling most people have is that these changes just arn't worth the trouble, especialy considering the armour retrieved at the end of it. As it is it doesn't actualy remove much from the game, unless you were looking forward to Ruby, but it doesnt rearly add much worth to the game either (unless you like bordom or are very lucky ;)).
