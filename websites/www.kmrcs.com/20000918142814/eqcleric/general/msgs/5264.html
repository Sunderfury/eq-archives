: Perhaps this is overstated, but oh well. This is a request that will hopefully work to all of our advantage.

: there should be a new section or something, when there is time, on this board dedicated to the Location of the Quest Items and spawn times. 

: I hate spoilers for the most part, but giving our items horrendous respawn times is a total waste of our time. It is hard enough to fight in the scryer room as it is because it is always camped, but sitting there to get a quest item for six hours is just too much.

: A list of /loc's and locational details and spawn times will make it easier for those of us who do not want to camp and just want to check while passing through. I refuse to waste my time and the time of my group on waiting for a little bag to suddenly appear on the ground. It is more fun to go hunting a killing than to wait for an item.

: just my 2cents
