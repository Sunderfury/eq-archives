: I've been thinking about playing a gnome cleric for roleplaying purposes (with some powergaming mixed in ;)) and was curious if the extreme lack of wisdom will hurt me in later levels? The base is 30 less than high elves. I'm not a number cruncher so maybe it's not as bad as it looks but it seems like a vast difference. Any gnomes or others out there with some advice? Thanks. :)<p>: Gnosh<p>I am a Cleric of the 34th lvl and a Gnome. I think I am the only Gnome Cleric on the Tunare server and When I created Bova I was not able to access the information available today. Your question was if The lack of wisdom hurts and the answer is positively yes. I am outmatched greatly by other clerics of much lower level but I can say this If you want to be Unique, be a Gnome Cleric. You will defiatley turn some heads and get some interesing comments. I have grown to love being a Gnome I play it up to the max and now that I have full plate mail I really turn a few heads. I would not change a thing about Bova hes perfect the way he is and with wisdom enhancing items my wisdom is 134 now and very respectable and my str is 98 so I guess it up to you friend. You can choose to be a Dwarf or High Elf Cleric like everyone else in the game or be Unique I have chosen to be Unique.
