: The idea that rewarding hunting by zone boarders or safe hunting spots, rather than getting a good well balanced group and exploring/hunting deeper into dungeons strikes me as the wrong approch to take.

: This is effectivly what you seemed to be suggesting in your response, and to a certain extent what the devlopers have introduced with this approch.

: While playing in safe areas death is rare, corpse recovery is easy, as is getting a res in two hours wether you have a cleric in your party or not (at least compared to the alternative).

: If you/party has the gut's to go out and explore or hunt deeper into dungeons the risk of death increases 10 fold (harder to get out, more mobs to get through, generaly harder mobs, etc ....). This by it's very nature means you will die more, and will spend much more time (and often more challanging than the inital hunt) in corpse recovary.

: For this more adventurous & fun risk we are know also saything that after dying and spending two+ hours in corpse recovary you will not even get exp back.

: Am I the only one who thinks this is backwards ?

: The situation i was in last night is not a big deal but it does ephasis both how badly thought out the nurf was thought out. Both in the fact that a time limit rather than some other solution; and the reduculasly low time limit they actualy implimented.

: If they are going to nurf something they are going to get complaints. It's human nature especialy when people have grown used to how things work and adapted to them. The least they can do I would have thought is think things through a bit better first and nurf in a way that at least adds somthing back to the game.

: They at least managed this to a certain extent with the dot spells, making them harder to kite but increasing there effectivness in group situations (which was presumably what they were origonaly intended for). Why can't they put the same level of thought & effort into our cleric resurection spells ?
