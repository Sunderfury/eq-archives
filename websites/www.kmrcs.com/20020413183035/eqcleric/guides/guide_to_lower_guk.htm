          common drop Guise of the Deceiver, 4 ac, plus 13 charisma, plus 7
          magic resist mask which has Illusion: Dark Elf.&nbsp; Only bards and
          rogues can wear the mask but anyone can use the effect from your
          inventory.&nbsp; His rare drop is a Serrated Bone Dirk, 8 damage, 26
          delay piercing weapon which procs encompassing darkness, rogue only.</font></p>
          </font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">

          </font><font face="Arial" size="2">common drop is a Light Burlap Sack,
          an 8 item holding backpack which reduces weight by 70%, and his rare
          drop is one sweet as hell belt, the Thick Banded Belt.&nbsp; 8 ac,
          plus 15 str, weight 0.5, ALL/ALL.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Walk down the stairs to
          the right of the ladder, clear the frogs, and you'll come to a room
          with 5 frogs in it.&nbsp; In one of these spots spawns a <em><strong>Ghoul
          Savant</strong></em>.&nbsp; He drops the <strong>black enameled mace</strong>
          as the common drop, 8 damage 28 delay mace, and <strong>black enameled
          chestplate</strong> as his rare drop, an AC25 black plate chest, good
          stuff.</font></p>
          <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">
          <p>Go down the stairs, you get to the third floor.&nbsp; Head straight
          right and you'll enter a room with 4 jail cells and a platform in the
          middle.&nbsp; On top of the platform spawns the <em><strong>Ghoul
          Executioner</strong></em>, his booby drop is an <strong>executioners
          hood</strong>, 5 ac, plus 4 str plus 9 dex leather hat, very nice for
          rogue.&nbsp; His rare drop is of course, the <strong>executioners axe</strong>,
          25 damage, 50 delay, effect: Haste, warrior only 2h slashing weapon.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">Also to
          the right of the staircase you'll find a room with a book case in it.&nbsp;
          In there spawn the <em><strong>Ghoul Sage</strong></em> and <em><strong>Ghoul
          Scribe</strong></em>.&nbsp; The sage drops a belt, forget the name
          right now, that has 2 ac, plus 4 int, plus 8hp, and a rare drop hat
          (forget the name), that gives 4 wis, 9 int.&nbsp; The scribe's common
          drop is a <strong>Parchment of Flayed Skin</strong>, most likely some
          quest item, and I don't know what his rare drop is.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">To the
          left of the stairs you'll find a room with 3 frogs and a bed in it, in
          there spawns the <em><strong>Ghoul Cavalier</strong></em>. His common
          drop are <strong>adamantite epolets</strong>, 9 ac plus 7 wis plate
          based shoulders, and his rare drop is the <strong>Dark Reaver</strong>,
          a 20 damage 42 delay SK only slashing weapon, which procs steal
          strength.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="2"><font face="Arial" size="2">Also to
          the left of the staircase you'll find another room with 3 frogs that
          leads to the lobby, which you can also get to by dropping off the
          bridge where the 3 tals are.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">From the lobby, follow
          the path the hall and you'll get to a jail room with 4 cages, and 3
          halls.&nbsp; If you go straight, you'll have to clear out about 10
          frogs ranging from wans to dars and their mage equivalents. Very tough
          frogs. If you're good you can do these in pulls of 2.&nbsp; Keep
          heading in and you'll get to a long room with a trap in the center.&nbsp;
          Avoid the trap.&nbsp; If you do fall in, it just drops you down a bit,
          you can make your way back up the ladder NP.&nbsp; On either side of
          the trap there is a room.&nbsp; The left room has a pillar of water in
          it, swim up that and you'll find the <em><strong>Reanimated Hand</strong></em>,
          with 1 dar guard.&nbsp; The common drop off the hand are <strong>serpentine
          bracers</strong>, 1 ac, plus 3 dex, plus 9 agi, plate looking, awesome
          bracers.&nbsp; The rare drop sucks, <strong>adamantite band</strong>,
          plus 75hp, minus 10 magic resist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">The right room will
          lead to a ladder, not sure whats down there, and will loop back around
          into a little bedroom where the <strong>Ghoul Arch Magi</strong>
          spawns. His common drop are silver silk leggings, not sure on exact
          stats, but they have 4 ac and I believe some plus int.&nbsp; His rare
          drop is either a <strong>Robe of the Archmage</strong> or a <strong>Shiny
          Metallic Robe</strong>, don't have stats as I haven't seen this item
          myself, apparently it's great though.</font></p>
          <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">
          <p>Keep heading straight, you'll run into maybe 10 more frogs, and
          you'll get to the <em><strong>Ghoul Lord</strong></em>.&nbsp; Don't
          even attempt this without a full group of level 45+, or 2 full groups
          of levels 40+, this bugger is NASTY.&nbsp; Doubles for 125, Harm
          Touches for close to 500, and has over 8000 hitpoints.&nbsp; He also
          has 2 guards in his room, either dar knights, bok knights (level 43 to
          46) or jin wizards (43 to 46).&nbsp; Fighting all 3 of these combined
          is basically suicide unless you have a killer high group, so you'll
          need to pull 1 of these solo.&nbsp; I'm not going to get into the
          intricasies of Aggro Radius pulling, but if you have a skilled puller
          he should be able to figure it out.&nbsp; The ghoul lord's common drop
          is a <strong>skull shaped barbute</strong>, a 13 ac, plus 35 hp, plus
          10 magic resist plate helm, and his rare drop is the <strong>Shortsword
          of the Ykesha</strong>, 8 damage, 24 delay 1h slasher which procs
          ykesha, a 70 damage DD spell.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</font><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial">If you
          take the left path of the prison type room you get to some froglok
          slave camp, and if you take the right path you get to a serious maze
          like area with 40+ frogs crawling all over the place.&nbsp; This way
          leads to the <em><strong>Ghoul Sentinel</strong></em> (drops <strong>brigandine
          tunic</strong>) and the <em><strong>Frenzied Ghoul</strong></em>,
          which drops the <strong>flowing black silk sash</strong>.&nbsp; From
          what I've gathered this path is harder than the path to the ghoul
          lord, so you don't have a prayer unless you're with at least one full
          group of 45+.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
