: You need to get a magical weapon.  Your cheapest option would be a RTS (Runed Totem Staff).  You can purchase one for 10pp or less or get it yourself pretty easily in Split Paw or Lake Rathe.  If you haven't kept up your 2H blunt, now would be a good time to kick start it with some practice points.  If you have the money or the resources to do the quest yourself, your best bet would be to get a Staff of the Observer.  It's a great weapon for a mid-level cleric.<p>: If you can't find a reasonable way to hunt in Unrest, which is great for you until your upper 20's, you can also try East/South Karana.  You can solo gorge hounds and probably find groups to hunt reavers if you want something with loot in East Karana.  The aviak village in South Karana is also good and Split Paw isn't yet past your level.  You can also fight aviaks and gnolls in Lake Rathe.  The only thing you may have trouble with is finding a merchant.  The centaurs in South Karana may sell to you.  I've never tried with a DE before.<p>What about the aviak merchant at the top of the aviak village - Krak Windchaser I believe. He still sells to me even though I've killed a few hundred of his cousins...<p>
