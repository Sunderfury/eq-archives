            <p align="center"><strong>Ferrik Bloodforge, Cazic Thule</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <p>When I wrote my original guide for this zone, I was around level
            22 and had been in Unrest (exclusively) since level 15. Obviously
            there were some things in the zone that I had not experienced at
            that point. Though I knew about most of the higher level MOBs and
            areas, I had not had much first hand experience with them. After
            another 10 levels or so in Unrest, I think I can fill in most of the
            gaps. I will give it a good shot at the very least. I know I will
            miss a few things and make a couple errors, so apologies in advance.</p>
            <p>There are descriptions of Unrest on EQ'lizer and other sites that
            paint a decent picture of what you will find in the zone and the
            level ranges of the MOBs. These sites are mostly accurate, but do
            contain some information that can get you into trouble. Obviously,
            others may have had different experiences in Unrest and may not
            agree with everything that I include here.</p>
            <p><big><strong>The Estate of Unrest</strong></big>:</p>
            <p><strong>Getting there</strong>: Unrest can be found off of
            Dagnar's Cauldron, which is in turn off of the Butcher Block
            Mountains. To reach Unrest after zoning into the Cauldron: Follow
            the long, winding gorge path that brings you to the heart of the
            Cauldron. Once the high walls fall away, continue a short distance
            up the slope in front of you until you see the water-line directly
            ahead and the NPC camp to your right. These NPCs are
            &quot;Good&quot; and will help you if you are of a good race and
            have decent faction. It is worth noting that these NPCs are not
            extremely high in level and they take a while to kill creatures such
            as Aqua Goblin Tidal Lords - luckily there are several NPCs here to
            help. Evil races and classes should most likely avoid this camp -
            although one of the NPCs is a Gnome.</p>
            <p>Once you have reached this point (water in front, NPC camp on the
            right), I have found that the best path to take is to continue on to
            the water's edge, turn right and start running (keeping the water on
            your left). The entrance to Unrest is about a 2 minute non-SOWed
            run. The entrance will be the typical cave in the side of the
            mountain that you see often in EQ. During this run you will most
            likely see several Aqua Goblins and you will pass their main camp.
            Just stay between Goblin camp and the water-line and they should not
            bother you. The real dangers are the wandering Aqua Goblins that
            criss-cross the Cauldron (lake). These jump in and out of the water
            and roam the shores. Avoid them when you can. When you can not, if
            you are too low of level to fight, you will have to train them to
            the Unrest entrance and zone in (or to the Butcher zone if you are
            leaving). Please remember to call out that you are training to the
            zone point - especially if you are training Tidal Lords to the
            Unrest entrance as their will be many players recuperating just
            outside.</p>
            <p>The Goblins are the biggest danger in the Cauldron and they range
            from the high-teens to the mid-twenties in level. You will also find
            Undertow Skeletons (high-teens), Rats (12-14ish I think), Giant
            Snakes (non-aggro, in the lower teens) and an Orc Camp (never
            tangled with them but I assume they are in the mid-teens). There is
            also a named Undertow Skeleton in the zone that sometimes drops a
            set of mediocre shoulderpads that have decent AC and add to your
            save vs cold.</p>
            <p><strong>Physical layout</strong>: Unrest is a small zone. Much
            smaller than many of the 'dungeon&quot; zones. The basic layout is:
            A long hallway that leads from the entrance to the courtyard. The
            courtyard is a medium-sized square area with a pair of fountains. A
            path runs between the fountains. If you continue on the path past
            the fountains, you will come to the mansion. The courtyard and the
            mansion are separated by a small hedge-maze. This is not really a
            maze and just lends an aesthetic touch to the zone.</p>
            <p>The mansion sits in the middle of the larger square area on this
            side of the maze. This is the meat of the zone. There are three
            doors leading to the first floor of the house - one in the front,
            one on the left side and one in the back. Players will use all of
            these doors to pull MOBs out to their groups who typically wait
            along the walls on the edge of the zone.</p>
            <p>The house has 3 floors and a basement. There are a few stairways
            within the house that will take you to the various levels. Not all
            rooms on each level connect and can sometimes only be reached by a
            particular stairway. The basement is found behind a secret doorway
            on the first floor. If you were to enter the house by the front door
            and take the left-most hallway towards the rear of the house, you
            would find this bookcase behind the second door on your left (in
            this left-hand hall). One click and you have found the passageway to
            hell.</p>
            <p><big><strong>MOBs &amp; Areas</strong></big>:<br>
            The outside of the house (lawn) and the floors help separate the
            different levels of creatures. There are several &quot;special&quot;
            MOBs in this zone which I will describe separately after this
            section.</p>
            <p><strong>On the lawn</strong> and in the courtyard you will find
            what the higher levels refer to as &quot;yard trash.&quot; These are
            the Death Beetles, Greater Skeletons, Tormented Dead (TD), Jack o'
            Lanterns and sometimes a low level Ghoul. These range from the
            mid-teens to the high-teens and can be very dangerous as they are
            aggro to players in this level range and they like to swarm -
            especially the beetles. --The loot for this area consists of the
            standard loot for most low-level areas of EQ - small amounts of
            coin, some cloth or cheap armor, rusty weapons with the occasional
            bronze weapon.</p>
            <p><strong>The first floor</strong> of the house contains Ghouls,
            Dark Boned Skeletons, Lurking Mummies and, sometimes, a Dry Boned
            Skeleton. These creatures are in the upper teens and can be quite
            tough for groups around the same level (Dry Bones are in the 20's).
            On the first floor, like elsewhere in the house, the MOBs spawn
            close together and there may be those that you do not see hiding
            behind doors or walls. Everything in the house is aggro to those who
            are not very high of level. Also, many of the MOBs from this point
            on start requiring magical weapons to be hit. --The loot for this
            area consists of runes, words, pages, rawhide and ring armor, and
            bronze weapons.</p>
            <p><strong>On the second floor</strong> of the house will you find
            Dry Boned Skeletons, Skeletal Monks, Carrion Ghouls, Werebats and
            Barbed Bone Skeletons. These baddies range from the low 20's to the
            high 20's and have some interesting characteristics. The Drys cast
            fire-based spells. The monks hit hard and fast - you will see them
            using some of the monk's special attacks. The Carrions will root you
            often and beat the heck out of you. Bats are quick little beasts who
            hit for fast damage. The Barbeds will possibly be your first glimpse
            into the &quot;Goodness, how many hit points does this thing
            have?!?&quot; arena, and some of them are casters as well. All of
            the Barbeds hit VERY hard. You will also find the Reclusive Ghoul
            Magi on the 2nd Floor. He will be noted a bit later. --The loot in
            this area is most player's initiation to &quot;the Good Life.&quot;
            Here you will find small bronze armor (mostly on the Drys) and fine
            steel weapons.</p>
            <p><strong>The third floor</strong> of the mansion is not all that
            different from the second when it comes to the normal spawns. Here
            you will find the Drys, Monks, Barbeds and CG's. However, the third
            floor is a bit different than the others as it is not as much of a
            true floor as it is a series of rooms that have different access
            stairways. I will go into some of these rooms in the next section as
            most of them hold the &quot;special&quot; MOBs, but the new arse-kickers
            that you will find in these rooms are Hags, Greater Dark Bones, an
            Undead Knight, a Reanimated Hand, Zombie Nobles and an Undead
            Barkeep. All of these new baddies are levels 24-30 and can really
            dish out the damage. The Greater Dark Bones (GDBs), Hags and the
            Nobles are not truly &quot;special&quot; MOBs as they do not drop
            specific items, but they are some of the toughest in the zone and
            worthy of a description in that section. --The loot is the same as
            the second floor with the exception of the special MOBs.</p>
            <p><strong>The Basement</strong>: Last, but certainly not least, we
            shall look at the basement. This was that pit of hell I referred to
            earlier. Here you will find many of the same MOBs that we have seen
            on the second and third floor, but you will see a lot more of them
            and they tend to be higher level than elsewhere. Again, the basement
            is behind the bookcase on the first floor. The basement has a main
            area and another secret area behind a false wall. In the main area
            of the basement you will find Hags (and lots of them!), Werebats,
            Monks, Barbeds and some very tough GDBs. Behind the secret wall -
            which is up the first set of stairs in the main area if you just
            keep heading in from the entrance - you may find more Hags and GDBs,
            a Mortuary Fungus, Tentacle Terrors and of course, Garanel
            Rucksforth, the lvl 37ish Dwarven Spirit. All of these will be
            described in the next section. **NOTE: if you go through the false
            wall and down the hall to the point where you see a pool of lava
            directly in front of you and what appear to be walkways on either
            side - walk THROUGH the lava. It will not hurt you. The walkways are
            traps and you will fall into a pit, taking damage and possibly
            coming face-to-face with a tough basement denizen.</p>
            <p><strong>There is also an underwater cave</strong> in the stream
            by the Gazebo to the right of the house&nbsp; that contains a
            strange little Gnomish Spelunker and a high level MOB spawn
            (typically a Monk or Hag). The Gnome will attack you if you pull the
            MOB. The Gnome is about level 24 and people seem to have fun killing
            him. You will often hear shouts of &quot;Kill the Gnome!&quot; in
            the zone.</p>
            <p><big><strong>Special Mobs</strong></big>:<br>
            <strong>Greater Dark Bones</strong> are this zone's ultimate undead
            tank. These level 28-30 baddies hit for 50+ damage and potentially
            have 1000's of hit points. They are found in the third floor Knight
            Balcony and in the basement. --They have poor loot unless they are
            carrying piece of bronze armor or a FS weapon.</p>
            <p><strong>Festering Hags</strong> are perhaps the most feared
            creature in the zone - though they are not necessarily the toughest.
            Hags are casters pure and simple. If you don't let a Hag cast, you
            may live. They have a good amount of hit points but are not great at
            fisticuffs. Have the entire party melee Hags so they can not cast.
            If they do hit you with one of their spells, be ready to take 200+
            damage if you are under level 25. Rush them, hit them, nuke them -
            do not let one stand and cast from afar or you will lose several
            group members before she decides to come in close and melee. Hags
            are found in the Basement and on the Knight Balcony.&nbsp; --Hags
            carry decent amounts of coin, gossimer armor, fine steel weapons and
            other random items.</p>
            <p><strong>Zombie Nobles</strong> are similar to a GDB. They hit
            hard and have a lot of hit points. They are found in the Barroom
            with the Undead Barkeep. --They have poor loot unless they are
            carrying piece of bronze armor or a FS weapon.</p>
            <p><strong>The Mortuary Fungus</strong> spawns behind the secret
            wall in the basement. He is a 26-28ish MOB that hits (fairly) hard
            and has a decent amount of hit points. His main weapon is a very
            powerful Drowsy spell that makes tanks swing like they are in
            molasses. Nuke him as much as you can because the tanks will not be
            able to do much damage. --I have never seen him carry more than a
            small amount of gold and possibly a cheap piece of jewelry.</p>
            <p><strong>Tentacle Terrors</strong> are level 28ish MOBs that are
            also found behind the secret wall in the basement. They are usually
            guarding the Dwarven Spirit. These silly looking cone-heads hit
            hard, drain you with the occasional life-tap, and will throw you
            across the room using their tentacles. You typically do not take a
            lot of damage from being thrown, however this makes battle hard for
            one of two reasons: if your tanks keep getting thrown, they have to
            run back over and start hitting again; or sometimes the Terror will
            stay on the player that it has thrown and chase him across the room
            or lawn and the entire party will have to scramble to get back into
            melee. --So far I have not looted anything decent from a TT. They
            have yielded pretty much the same type of loot as the Fungus.
            Assumedly they carry the rare Tentacle Whip.</p>
            <p><strong>The Reclusive Ghoul Magi</strong> is, as his name
            implies, a Ghoul Caster. He conjures a Necro skel pet and casts
            Boiling Blood, a painful DOT spell. he is around level 28. He spawns
            in one of the far back rooms on the second floor, near the back
            staircase that leads to the Barroom and Knight Balcony. --The Magi
            drops two good items - the Savant's Cap (+3 to WIS and INT) or the
            Blood Stained Gloves (+25 mana for Pure Casters).</p>
            <p><strong>The Reanimated Hand</strong> spawns in a third floor area
            that is off of the &quot;Stuck Room&quot; where you will find CGs
            and Skels frozen in place - bugged. The Stuck Room is accessed via a
            flight of stairs found in the middle of the second floor. The Hand
            spawn is through the only door in this room. The Hand casts a
            powerful force spell, but, like the Hags, he can be interrupted
            easily. If the Hand can not cast, he is very easy to kill. He is
            typically around 26 in level. --The Hand drops one of the most
            coveted items in the zone - the Ivory Bracelet (+3 AGIL and +20 mana).</p>
            <p><strong>The Undead Barkeep</strong> is found in the Barroom of
            course. This room is in the back of the house off of the stairway
            that continues up to the Knight Balcony. The Keeper spawns behind
            the little structure that is shaped like a, you guessed it, bar. The
            Keeper is another level 26-28ish MOB. --The Barkeep drops the Thick
            Leather Apron (8 AC, 1 weight) or the Opalline Earring (2 AC, +5
            CHAR).</p>
            <p><strong>The Undead Knight of Unrest</strong> spawns on the third
            floor balcony that is often referred to as the Knight Balcony. This
            is at the very top of the staircase in the back of the house. The
            Knight is a 26-28ish undead Shadow Knight who will life-tap. He also
            casts other aggressive spells and has a pet. He is one of the most
            sought-after MOBs in the zone for the loot he carries. --The Knight
            drops Bloodstained Tunics (12 AC +4 WIS +4 AGIL) and Bloodstained
            Mantles (+3 STR and +10 vs magic).</p>
            <p><strong>Garanel Rucksforth</strong> spawns in the very back of
            the basement after the secret wall and false lava pool. He is
            usually accompanied by 2 Hags and 2 Tentacle Terrors. If you are
            going to take him on, make sure to get rid of his outer-most guards
            first. It is doubtful you will be able to take care of the two
            closest to him without Garanel coming as well. He is around level
            35-37 and hits very hard and fast. I have been hit by him for four
            times in one round for 80+ damage each. Do not take him on without a
            full group of 30ish or higher levels. --Garanel drops the Dwarven
            Work Boots (8 AC, +3 STR, +5 DEX) or Jagged Bands (5 AC, +3 STR)</p>
            <p><big><strong>Pulling:</strong></big><br>
            This section will suggest reasonable pulling techniques for some
            general level ranges. Please note that this is very subjective and
            having a group member or two that is higher level than the suggested
            range will change things considerably.</p>
            <p><strong>Levels 15-18</strong><br>
            If you're here before level 15, you are brave! (Admittedly many come
            here as early as 12-14 now): At this stage you should stick with the
            yard trash. Kill beetles, TDs, Greater Skels and Jacks. Some Jacks
            will be tough, even for a full group. Personally, I think that the
            Jacks are the most fun MOB in the game - hilarious pumpkin headed
            suckas. Get ready to run when you look down and see 10 beetles at
            your feet. They are meaner than they look. The best place to pull to
            will most likely be around Gazebo on the right side of the house.
            This area is literally crawling with low level critters and you are
            close enough to the zone to make a run for it. This is also the
            least likely place to get trained by high level MOBs.</p>
            <p><strong>Levels 17-18</strong><br>
            If your group is on the high end of the 15-18 range, you may want to
            try your hands at pulling from the first floor of the house. Be
            careful though, it is very easy to end up with more than you wanted
            to pull. Try out a few Dark Bones and Ghouls and see how you do.
            Then move on to Mummies. Remember, some of these guys take a magical
            weapon to hit, so if your tanks don't have a magical hitter, you're
            gonna be in trouble. Also, the puller should always be ready for
            that unexpected Hag or Werebat to be wandering around on the first
            floor. These do not spawn here but may be returning to their rooms
            after someone pulled them and then zoned. When you first start
            playing with the house creatures, get ready to run a lot.</p>
            <p><strong>Levels 19-25</strong>:<br>
            As a level 19+ Cleric in an undead zone, you will be in demand. You
            have some strong buff and healing spells as well as some decent
            undead-nukers. Use this to your advantage and work your way into
            some 20+ groups. The experience and loot will be much better. This
            is when Unrest gets fun. These groups will be taking on the second
            and third floor MOBs. Make sure to heal first and nuke second unless
            you have a few Clerics. Always keep Hag watch for your group. If you
            see someone's health plummet, there is a good chance a Hag has
            attached itself to the puller. Hags like to come out of the house
            late in the battle and start casting from afar. Shout it to your
            party and have them rush her. If they don't react quickly, your
            puller is going to die. Always try and have at least two clerics in
            the group. One is the primary healer, the other nukes a bit but
            holds some mana back for heals as well. You will now want to start
            pulling to the left-side or back of the house to avoid the lower
            level creatures that will still attach themselves to your pullls at
            times. Also, there are some sites and people who suggest pulling to
            the front of the zone near the fountains. I assume that this is so
            you can zone faster if you pull too much. I maintain that this is a
            very bad idea as up there you are in &quot;train alley&quot; and
            will constantly have others group's trains attaching themselves to
            your fights. I hate to waste time zoning to get away from other
            people's mistakes.</p>
            <p><strong>Level 25+ (campers?)</strong>:<br>
            This is where you will have to make a decision. A 25+ group is fully
            capable of camping any room in the house. Most people have an
            aversion to camping. However, most of us have had to get over this
            due to the fact that if we don't, someone else will and we will not
            have anything to pull. You may not agree, but camping is a way of
            life in all decent zones these days. Poke your head into the throne
            room in Cazic-Thule to find the same group that was there 7 hours
            ago. So here it is - either pull from the second floor, third floor
            and basement if they are not all taken by groups, or camp a room. It
            is up to you and your group. I would suggest not taking a seat in
            the basement until the group is around level 28 or so. At level 28+
            we would sit in the basement for hours and I have not seen better
            experience for that level anywhere else in the game. But it gets
            rough down there and spawns have a way of hitting all at once. But
            since the only actual special MOB in the basement is Garanel and
            most people are not of the level to mess with him, we did not anger
            many people by camping that area.</p>
            <p>Around level 30, experience becomes hard to get in Unrest unless
            you sit in the basement. At 30 most people move on to Cazic or other
            zones.</p>
            <p>This has gotten very long and I hope I have covered most of the
            zone without making too many errors.</p>
            <p>Lots of luck to you all,</p>
