<br>As long as your group thinks you can melee, blast, AND heal effectively, they can expect to die ALOT.  You are a cleric, and your priority is to keep the others alive, which is why your melee skills are awful and your DD spell is mana expensive...and that goes for ALL races, even the stronger dwarves.  My regular group consists of a tank, an enchanter, and a cleric.  We add others as we go.  When we find a group that understands the role of the enchanter, we are almost invincible.   The enchanter keeps the MoBs mezzed, which allows the tanks to take out one MoB at a time, and me to keep the tanks healed.  If a stray MoB attacks the wizzie, I MAY melee it off, if I can, until it can be taunted off or  the enchanter enthralls it.  If I start getting pounded after throwing out a greater heal to an ailing tank, I don't even bother to melee (no point , MoBs laugh at my puny efforts), I just wait for the enchanter to mez it.  Wrath is way too expensive a spell to use at the expense of healing, especially when there's a wizzie on board.    If your group doesn't understand your role, then lose the group.  I'm sure they can find a misguided cleric somewhere who will be happy to wrath and tank for them, and they can all die together.<p>Elyssa Brigantia<br>35th Cleric<br>Bristlebane<br>
