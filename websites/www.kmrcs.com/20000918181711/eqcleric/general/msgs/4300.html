: WOW!

: ANOTHER ERUDITE CLERIC OF QUELLIOUS!!

: Hehe, sorry, I don't meet many.

: I'll keep my reply short (heh) and sum up how I do things.

: I leap in and melee in the begining of a fight if I am at full mana. Once someone needs a heal, I start the heal/meditate routine.

: I'll occasionally zap the creature with a Force, but the only time I use Wrath is if there is another cleric in the part who tells me to go ahead and nuke 'cause he'll do the healing. Even so, I always save 40% of my mana for heals.

: If your regular group is expecting you to use your resources in a way you think is wasteful, then you either need to set them straight or find another group. It has been my experience that most knowledgeable group leaders recognize the importance of the cleric not only having mana to cast spells, but keeping the creatures off the cleric so they can cast.
