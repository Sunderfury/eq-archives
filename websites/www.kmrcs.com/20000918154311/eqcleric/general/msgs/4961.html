: Well we do seem to be getting the shaft to some degree so far.
: Lets see...

: Boots of the Reliant = AC 9, +6 vs Disease
: Rubicite Boots = AC 10
: Crafted Boots = AC 12

: Ardent Gauntlets = AC 10, +5 Agi, +5 vs Cold
: Rubicite Gauntlets = AC 11
: Crafted Gauntlets = AC 12

: Some may argue that the gauntlets +5 agi might be nearly as good as 2 AC, but the boots are simply not as good as rubi. That +6 vs disease is insignificant 95% of the time.

: Does anyone know what this stuff looks like?
: I understand that some of the other new armor looks like colored chainmail instead of colored platemail. I hope ours looks like golden plate, and not drab brown chainmail.
