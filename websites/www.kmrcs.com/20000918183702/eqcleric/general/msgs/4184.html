I wouldnt shun unrest from your first brief (but admitadly unplesent) experiance. It is a great place to hunt, but like any new area you have a bit of a learning curve to start off with. spock undead and invis to undead are both very usefull spells here (invis before you zone is a very good idea).<p>East Karana as mentioned bellow also has undead gnoll revers (I hunted them for a while at one point but ive forgot what level exactly, around were you are at teh moment though).<p><br>: Try East Karana. The crag spiders and gorge hounds are good xp for low 20's - poor loot though. From there, you can always slip into the Beholder Maze for a change of pace - the gorge minos and muddite elders ought to be about right for you - again, poor loot though.<p>
