: In all of my 40 levels  - I have yet to even come close to having a
: problem finding a group.Just the opposite - too many people want me
: and I always have a tough time making a choice on who to group with.

: I havent read all the posts yet -- but do you have
: fun playing your wizard? Clerics arent for everybody - it has to fit the
: type of person you are -- just like druids or
: wizards arent for everyone.

: The more levels I get -the more in demand I have become -----

: The only question I have for you other then the wizard
: one -- is -- did you make any friends in all you play time?
: Most of my group requests come from all the people I made
: friends with
