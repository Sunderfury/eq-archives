And he was pretty nice about it, but Verant <b>HATES</b> the word petition.  I mean it really bugs them.  They see petitions as demands, and they do not like giving in to demands.<p>I personally viewed our petition as a list of requests.  Some of the items I included were dead on arrival (bandages for instance, sheesh), but were included because there was a segment of our population who wanted them.  The Retribution damage was included for the same reason.  I can't pass off blame on Undead dmg increase because I wanted that too (still do, but am willing to accept not having it).  <p>If I had to do it over again I would have taken a stronger stand on some issues, but then again, if I had to do it over again I doubted that I would do it.  All I really wanted was a med key and the stun thingy removed.  Fifty percent wasn't so bad was it?<p>Rayne
