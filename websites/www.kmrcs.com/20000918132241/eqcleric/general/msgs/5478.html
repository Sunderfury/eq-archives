I'd like to thank Castore for pointing me in the right<br>direction for this quest.  Part one involves getting the<br>diary that is in the burnt out cabin.  The location of <br>the cabin is 1700 x 1100 in the Kithicor Forest.  When you<br>enter the cabin, the diary will be in the back left corner<br>on an area that looks like grass.<p>The diary tells you the Ingot is on an old stump in a ring<br>of trees/stumps.  Location is -90 x 3300 also in the forest.<br>You need to run up the ramp and jump to the stump.  I fell a few<br>times trying to make the leap, but did finally.  The Ingot <br>appears as a small bag on the stump.<p>With Ingot in hand, off to Lake Rathe to find Turgan the<br>Reliant. He can be found in a cabin along the shores of<br>lake rathe at 3639 x 145.  Here is where I am currently stuck.<br>When Hailed, he says "what is it that you want".  I have tried<br>every combination I can think of....even upper and lower case<br>responses.  Nothing so far has worked....and I'll be darned<br>if I'm gonna hand over the diary and find out it vanishes with<br>getting the icon.<p>With the spawn times of the diary and ingot set at 7 HOURS, I'm<br>going to take my time and figure this one out.  If anyone else<br>finds the answer, please post here.  Thanks.
