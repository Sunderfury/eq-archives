AMEN!  I have never met anyone on the game who gave me shit after healing them.  The people on this board I am sure never told their group they didnt want a cleric.  I am only level 18 and I know my groups wouldn't have been nearly as successful having to wait for health after every spawn.  For the most part people in the game love us clerics.  It is unfortunate there are some ingrates.  If you know them personally, I say.....F*ck em.  Let them sit there, or die.  <p>Dairikan <br>Level 18 Dark Elf<br>Rallos Zek<p>: This is for all the clerics out there that have been stymied by these anti-cleric posts. In my journeys, I have often come across the soloing warrior(or other class) resting at the zone who(upon noticing the blue casting) starts to beg for a heal. After getting one, if you remain in the area, keeps asking over and over whenever he/she is wounded again, but, never asks to group. Even bothers you if you are IN another group!!! The other night a warrior kept bugging me like this even though he was at half-life! When I told him to bugger off and that I was grouped he got pissed. Now I have seen druids and shamens be rather greedy about casting SOW and I think I am going to start heading down that road with healing. If ppl want to look at my class as a fantasy M*A*S*H who is just there to heal everyone thats BS, I have always been free with my casting and have often spent 2 or 3 meds buffing newbies for the hell of it, but if you are not in my group don't expect my help! Maybe this will shut up some of the fools who look down on clerics, the groups I hang with have nothing but respect for my class and this minority of jackasses is starting to aggrivate me, especially as I reach higher levels. Maybe they are nothing but a buncha newbies who JUST DON'T GET IT YET!!!!<p><br>
