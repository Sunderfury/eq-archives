A) If you are not going to give us wisdom on these quest items, then AT LEAST give them High AC... Mobs aggro on clerics when they HEAL and when they ATTACK. We have lower hps and ac then tanks, but must get beat on.  At high levels the cleric is often tanking more than the tanks. Why did you shaft US of all classes? I dont get it?<p>B) The cleric quests ENCOURAGE camping and because you put a +5 wis belt on one of the 6hour spawn quest mobs, CLERICS will never be able to realisticly do this quest, because there are 10 lvl 50 druids for each lvl 50 cleric. (btw: the +5 wis belt is better than the reward for this tedious quest anyway)<p>C) Why the rare quest item drops and 6 hour spawns anyway? What is the point? So that we can have to wait around doing nothing? How is this justified? The only POSSIBLE explanations is 1) either to make it so that the item is extremely hard to get and is ultra-rare... in which case your implementing the quest rewards 5 no-life people per server and punishes the rest, or 2) more wait, more time, equals more monthly checks. You decide.<p><br>D) If your reasoning for getting rid of rubicite was because it was too Multi-purpose, then why did EVERYONE get a replacement for rubicite? I bet the Enchanters, Wizards, Druids, Magicains are really sad about losing their Rubicite camp... At least thier items arent a swift kick in the behind like ours are to clerics (see #5 for an example)<p>E) All you have to do is read this to immediatly see how sad our new quests are. <br>http://www.soerbaird.com/forums/Forum60/HTML/000574.html <p><br>Look at what youve done.
