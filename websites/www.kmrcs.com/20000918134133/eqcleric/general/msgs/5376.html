: Ever since Verant introduced these quests, and claim its to reduce camping, I knew that was bull.

: These quests will do nothing but promote camping all the more.  I've heard people tell of longer spawn rates than there is even with the testament of vanear &quot;quest&quot;.

: Plus these quests are all high level quests, useless to most of us, so we go back to our old camping.

: Not sure if the item you mentioned is part of the quests, but it kinda sounded like it from what someone said in that thread.
