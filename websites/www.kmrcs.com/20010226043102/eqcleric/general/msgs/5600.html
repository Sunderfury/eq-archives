I'll agree with you on some things: The new Cleric armor in my opinion is worthless, and from what I hear and you have stated the spawn times for the necessary items is ridiculously long.  However..and this is a big however...there are plenty of other items still in the game that will make your cleric awesome, and I'm not talking about PoF stuff.  I laughed when i saw our mighty "cleric-only" armor gave us protections against poison/disease( I am 30th level now and havent run into anything that poisons or diseases me since level 22)...LOL..."they must be joking right" was all I kept saying over and over.  Note to Verant: If you want Clerics to be happy, give them plate armor that would increase thier Wisdom..it seemed like that was a no brainer, oh well.  I have decided that I'm not going to own any of it, I will stick with my wisdom enhancing items and continue to upgrade them with the same plan I had before the temple of solusek ro ever existed. If anyone wastes thier time getting the stuff, it's thier own personal choice..if that's fun for them that's totally fine.  I will ignore the Clerical armor quests all together as I feel it's not worth the effort, and it will make me happier than constantly letting it upset me that our class specific armor is crap.  I urge you to do the same, still plenty of items out there for you that have nothing to do with quests.<p>Til
