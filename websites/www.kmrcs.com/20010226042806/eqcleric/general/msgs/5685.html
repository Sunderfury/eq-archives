I agree.  This armor is, well, worthless to a cleric.  +5 int?????  I don't quite understand the reasons behind that.  <p>I've got the first part of the boots from Sludge in Runnyeye, but will probably just destroy it since Bilge is being camped by every level 50 shaman and druid on Tarew Marr (especially shamans since they have inherently lower wis to start with)<p>I think I will just continue to pick up the odd piece of random armor found here and there in the game that will increase my wisdom and strength until level 46 and then I'll try to get in on some PoF expeditions.
