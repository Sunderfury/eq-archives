I agree with you.  I think this armor was made for the mid lvl not the higher lvl(24 - 34).  At 36th lvl I will hunt lower guk or Nagfens Laiir to get the armor that will help me better.  IE Mithril BP and Bracers or the Black Enamaled BP.  I am not gonna give up my gator scale legging till i get something with better wis.  Hopefully with the new addition that is coming late this year or next year will have something better or maybe they can make gator scale leggings look like gator scale rather than rawhide.  Anyways I will do the quests later as well.  I just cant spend time in an area where everything cons green.<p><br>Good luck to all<br>Xene
