: fear not the lowered ac of sol ro armor
: woe not for the useless stats
: not the loss of the rubi effect BP
: not the seven hours of camping per item

: fear for the ease at which verant will nurf
: fear the carrot that verant waves in your face
: come too close and it will be drawn away again
: like a work horse you dont deserve the reward

: witness the nurfing of the plane of fear
: the nurfing of rubi armor
: the nurfing of jboots
: what will be next?

: what precedent has been set?
: the issue is not armor it is trust
: trust betrayed once
: twice

: oh but they must stop the kill stealers
: the rubi farmers
: does it come as a surprise that rare becomes common
: as the game matures

: no we saw it coming, rubi was becoming common
: but knew not the fix
: witness the nerf
: this is no accident rather verants habit

: the nerf can strike any time it suits them
: and will continue to strike from now on
: because if you bite that carrot
: you lose the maddened hunger to pull their money carts

: fear not the nerf
: but the evernerf
