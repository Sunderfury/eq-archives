I've heard melee classes complaining that they have trouble because there are just too many of them.  So what?  If you're chosing a cleric just because you think no one is playing them, you're chosing it for the wrong reason. Everyone has some trouble at higher levels.  That's because to do any serious hunting in a high level dungeon you must have a party.  As more and more people reach higher levels, the dungeons are more and more crowded.  There is no class out there that is going to guarantee that you get a party all of the time.<p>: It seems that you are in the minority though in thinking that there are too many high level clerics.  Perhaps you should post what server you are on.  That would be better information than just a generic claim that high level areas are overcrowded with clerics posted by someone anonymous.<p>: Lucretia Rialsq<br>: Cleric of Tunare<br>: Bristlebane<p>
