Hail, healers and lifesavers - As a bard, I tend to <br>die, often.  So, its nice being grouped with a level 39<br>cleric, as it saves me a long walk back.  However, I <br>seem to be missing something - I very rarely get any<br>xp back.  When I asked a cleric about it, he said that<br>you can sometimes partially resist the res, and there<br>was nothing he could do about it.  This seemed somewhat<br>questionable, but he seemed pretty certain.  Not <br>wanting to anger him, I let it go, and decided to ask <br>here.<p>So - can I resist a res?  If so, how can I avoid having<br>that happen?  Can res be cast multiple times, or is it<br>a once per corpse kind of thing?  Sorry for all the<br>questions, but 35 is driving me crazy.  I want out of <br>it as soon as possible and I need all the help I can <br>get. :)<p>-Lohengrin, cleric loving bard on Rallos Zek<br>
