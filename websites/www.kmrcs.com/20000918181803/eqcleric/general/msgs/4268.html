: I play a level 22 ranger, 12 cleric, and 13 wizard.  I'm not sure my comments are meaningful above level 30, but here they are:

: Some tanks do feel better when their casters melee.  It is a &quot;boy's club&quot; kind of mentality that I'm surprised you found at level 33.  &quot;Hey man, why didn't you melee?&quot;  I admit that when I play my ranger I do like it when my cleric will melee or burn a little bit.  They need to stay out of trouble, though!  A cleric is most effective when they are healing.

: I like a cleric who will melee when they have a full tank of mana.  That is what I do when I play my cleric - wait for the tank to build up some hate, then do a /assist on the tank.  If they don't have a full tank of mana, then go ahead and med.

: I see my cleric's melee starting to drop off even at level 12 though - I don't think a cleric is a warrior at all.  My dwarven cleric is a tough little bugger, but sorry, he is not a paladin or warrior.

: I like a cleric who burns in a limited and thoughtful way.  Finish a runner, take down a caster.  Just don't get the mob pounding on you - it is the tank's job get their head pounded.

: I think the group you were in was _Wrong_.  Their fundamental problems were:
: 1) Thinking that a caster (any caster, including a cleric) can cast while getting pounded on.
: 2) Thinking that a cleric's burn spells are more mana efficient than their healing spells.

: I wish you better luck in the future, and think you have a better idea of how to play your role than your group did...  Oh, and while Erudite clerics are rather tall and ugly, I think they can make fine healers.
