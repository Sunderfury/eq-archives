: I'm not so sure that is a good idea..  If the person your are consenting to DRAG your corpse drags it far far away (or even perhaps over a cliff or something) then you are screwed out of your corpse totally.  So in the end you would still have to trust the player enough to be dragging the corpse to a safer spot and not a bad one.

: Though the idea isn't all that bad since it would still give you a little bit more protection from corpse looters and you can always have somebody locate your corpse for you.

: Both good and bad sides I suppose  =)

: --Vinlaen of Rallos Zek (lvl 20)



: : I'm sure this has been petitioned before but here goes....

: : For all intensive purposes this is to help in corpse recovery.  I saw yet again how someone got their belongings looted when they couldn't get to their corpse and they abided in someone to drag the corpse only to get screwed over.

: : /consent loot &lt;name&gt;

: : Gives someone the ability to drag and loot your corpse

: : /consent drag &lt;name&gt;

: : Gives someone the ability to only drag your corpse.

: : Pretty simple, I wonder what Verant would say.
