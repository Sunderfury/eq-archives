So, I've been on Kerra Isle for 17 hours now. I've been taking turns with other clerics and druids on Mitty's spawn. I've personally killed Mitty 26-30 times? I've lost count.<p>During this agonizing camp, I have not, nor have any other players looted the gold ring from Mitty. SHE HAS NOT DROPPED IT ONCE! One of the players petitioned a GM. The GM said the spawn was working. A druid I have come to know well during the camp has said he has killed Mitty around 50 times and has not looted the gold ring.<p>Is this what camping an item for a Quest is all about? Is this what Verant intended? I've heard horror story after horror story from other players about quests. Now I have my own. I am very discouraged to do any more quests. Hopefully this is an isolated incident, although I assume most of you have horror stories of your own. The only good thing about this quest was I got to meet some really nice clerics and druids while camping.<p>I have currently given up on camping Mitty and the PAW quest. It is just not worth it to me to camp a mob for such a long time. <p>Goss Vicar<br>29th Cleric<br>Servant of BRELL SERILIS<br>Karana server<br>
