You will be able to do this in the Temple of Solusek Ro.  I think you need a high level jewel and some pp, I think I read about it on one of the mailing lists available out there.<p>Had that happen to me too- guy accused me of trying to KS.  I offered to show him that I could anytime I wanted to.  He said go ahead and try (so I took a screenshot of that message), then I proceeded to take the next 6 kills- still smiling at him.  Then I sai "I was making sure you were okay at first. Now do you see that I was not trying to KS you?"  LOL he petitioned and I offered to e-mail the guide the screenshot of the guy.  The guide told me this little wiz was a know KSer and he knew I was a good guy by reputation.<p>That was funny
