I'm sick.  Tired of being screwed over by Verant.  They shaft and nerf clerics any time they get the chance.  I played this game to have fun, not sit at stumps and burned out houses for a zillion hours bored out of my mind.  Give me a break, Verant.  I write to them, and they give me a form letter response.  So I'm finished.  No more.  <p>Asheron's Call 10-day free beta trial is out.  I'll try that.  Maybe they will get the questing part right.  Thanks for the (once) fun times, everyone.<p><br>-Former level 29 cleric.
