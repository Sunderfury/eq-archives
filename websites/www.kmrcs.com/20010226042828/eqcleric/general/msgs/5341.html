Where are you fighting first of all?  What are you fighting?<br>Have you got the Consider thing working right?  Try only<br>fighting things that are blue.  Try getting in a group and fighting<br>orcs.  Safety in numbers for that Young Kodiak or Lion that<br>may walk by.   When solo always remember how far you are<br>from the closest guard(s).<p>I have helped a friend level his monk to 10 in about 3-4 weeks, with<br>my 19 cleric buffs and being his insurance policy.<p>I have gotten my cleric to level 23 in about 3 months, <br>so people that they can get a character to 20 in a week<br>are lying or are major twinks first of all<p>: I've been playing my Cleric now for over four months and to me it's a great accomplishment that I've gotten him to Level 6.  That was a LOT of hard work.  <p>: However, I see people running around and talking about how "easy" it is to get to the teens and 20's and above levels in a few days of playing, or at MOST, a week.  HOW do they do this??  I can't do this!  It's taken me MONTHS to get from Lvl 1 to Lvl 6 and I'll consider myself lucky if I'm at Lvl 9 a year from now!<p>: I need help here.  I want to gain levels faster here. I want new spells and abilities and I am tired of gaining them so very slowly and watching everyone around me gain them so much faster.  I'm hard pressed to find ANYONE hunting in BB lower than a Lvl 8--I'm usually the lowest there!<p>: So can anyone help me here?  Tell me what kind of creatures to fight?  Where to fight?  That sort of thing?  Because whatever it is I am doing, while working, is working WAY too slowly and I want to become at least a Lvl 9 Cleric by maybe January or February :)<p>
