: I went through a similar situation to a certain extent. But I have found over the last few levels that it seems to be more the nature of some of the zones.

: Zones are primaraly camped for both items (and exp). In most of the zones ive hunted since 30 Clerics are still very much in demand, but if the particular camp is full (often the case) you will still not get a group.

: With regards to druids/shaman playing healer they can do this in most of these camps if no cleric is avalible. Groups tend to vary there fetching based on the party. If they have a cleric they will take on more than if they do not have a cleric.

: In Both Cazic and Lower Guk I have heard more calls for clerics than any other class, if a cleric doesnt fill the post, they generaly shout for healers, and then anyone they can get.

: Also in Guk I have heard shouts that you can take such and such a room without a cleric and that druids/shamans can't cut it is primary healer for a certan camp. These tend to be the higher level spots though.

: With reagrd to Solusek A, I dont think people hunt here unless they are after items, in which case they probably have a full (or suffiecnt party) when they arrive. At your level Najena is probably the same, charicters around 20 may hunt for exp, but high 20's and especialy 30's will be after an item and the groups were probably full.
