After sitting in a spell book medding forever, I wanted to see what the melee classes looked like.  Then I wanted to try various other classes, so I played the following:<p>High Elf Cleric 44 (and climbing)<br>Human Bard 14 (retired)<br>Wood Elf Druid 28 (retired)<br>Wood Elf Ranger 26 (semi-retired)<br>Human Monk 22 (semi-retired)<br>Human Enchanter 4 (and climbing)<br>Dark Elf Necro 18 (semi-retired)<br>My new Dorf Warrior (level 1 with some great equipment, but no experience- yet)<p>Yes, for a long time I had no life (lol - I was on disability recovering from surgery)<br>
