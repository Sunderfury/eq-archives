Clerics are versatile mainly because of our armor and nukes.

This is the hardest role because taunting is tough... best taunt is a heal but I get really nervous when my wimpy wizzie is getting hit.<p>They say the Bard is the "jack of all trades," and while that is true, Clerics can also fill in very well because of our versatility.  I have a mid-teens Bard and she is MUCH harder to play than the cleric!  <p>Most groups, I've found, don't really care how you play your cleric as long as you save their butts when the health bars sink.  I also find that it helps to INFORM them of your strategy when you're in a new group, because a cleric's role is often misunderstood.  For instance, I'll say something like, "I'm gonna use undead nukes to start off and save the rest for heals."  Or, "I'm gonna keep stunning the caster... once he's dead, I'll save the rest for heals."  Or, "Tank, I'm not gonna heal until you're at half-health, okay?"  For some reason, clerics tend to become the "anchor" for the group, and if the members aren't regular partners and familiar with your style, they get panicky if they don't know what you're doing. A regular stream of communication on your strategy really helps to calm them down... and has the added bonus of helping them to think about their own strategy, too.  It's a good way to trade ideas.  I've learned a helluva lot about the capabilities and strategies of the other classes this way.  I sometimes even get reminded of my OWN capabilities... hehe. Like the other night fighting stone skels and their pets in Lake Rathe... one of my partners said, "Maggs, don't you have a Summoned spell for the pets?"  DOH!<p>Maaggie<br>of Xegony<br>
