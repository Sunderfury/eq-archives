: The new cleric quests are not a punishment, they are a REWARD!
: Now, I am sure you are shocked, dismayed, and startled at these words ... be so kind as to allow me to prepare my rather convoluted, but entirely logical explination!
: As a cleric, I am sure we have all wished for the ability to solo - something that is rather difficult to do if you aren't near some undead of near your level.
: Guess what?  Now CLERICS can solo!
: Juul has become better at sitting in a burned out cabin for tedious hours that she is paying for(255)!
: An added bonus!
: For everyone tired of &quot;will you res xxxx please?&quot; spam, you can take your /annoy flag OFF!
: While you are sitting in a burned out cabin, no one will ask you for a res!  That's right - no one!  Why not you ask?  Because no one other than other people suckered into questing are there!
