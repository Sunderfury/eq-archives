      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">The Lull, Soothe, Calm (etc) line of spells was designed to allow
      you to reduce the aggresion level on a mob.&nbsp; This is mainly applicable to those times
      when you are looking at a camp of multiple mobs, any one (or more) of whom your group
      could take, but not all simultaneously.&nbsp; This is where Calm comes in.&nbsp; Start <em>calm</em>ing
      creatures, one at a time, until the only un-calmed ones left are the ones you wish to
      fight.&nbsp; Pull those mobs away from the camp (and out of the creatures aggro range),
      kill them, go get more.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Note: I recommend starting with the easiest creatures and working
      your way up because the lower the creature's level the lower the chance of resist.
      &nbsp; If a mob resists your spell, it (and all it's linked buddies) will come for you.</font></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The idea with these spells are to chase off unwanted mobs.&nbsp; When they are
      successful, the targeted mob leaves for approximately 30 - 45 seconds.&nbsp; I have seen
      it used in the following situations:<ol>
        <li>You have one or more extra mobs on you or your group.&nbsp; The idea is to spook/fear
          the extra mobs thereby giving your party time to kill one and be better prepared for the
          next one when it returns.</li>
        <li>An unwanted green/low blue comes to the party and it's just not worth the mana, hit
          points, and time it takes to kill it.&nbsp; Spooking it can give your party time to zone
          or be better prepared for the next fight.&nbsp; And you may get lucky and some other group
          who really desires the mob might grab it for you.</li>
        <li>Your group is getting overwhelmed and it's time to go.&nbsp; Getting rid of a few mobs
          might be the answer to gaining enough time for your party to safely vacate the premises.</li>
      </ol>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Remember Fear and Spook the Dead?&nbsp; Well, if another person/group is being
      obnoxious and grabbing your mobs (&quot;I'll do what I want and you can't stop
      me....&quot;) try spooking their mob.&nbsp; While this won't always work (spellcasters can
      Root of course), you might get lucky and send their tanks on a merry little run.&nbsp; It
      has been reported by several clerics that doing this a few times is often enough to
      correct <em>anti-social behavior</em> :P.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Once you can get this spell, NEVER leave home without it.&nbsp; It is by far one of the
      best spells we get.&nbsp; It has numerous applications, but the idea is to hold the mob in
      its place.&nbsp; Some examples of use are:<ol>
        <li>Stopping mobs from fleeing.&nbsp; There are two occasions when this is helpful or even
          necessary.&nbsp; One is saving your tanks the trouble of having to chase it down. &nbsp;
          Another is when you are in an area where the mobs will run for their (frequently bigger)
          brothers and sisters and bring them back to the party (Paw, Crushbone, and Upper Guk come
          to mind).&nbsp; If the mob is successful in reaching help, a fight your party was winning
          can quickly turn into a route.&nbsp; Don't let running mobs get away.</li>
        <li>You are fighting multiple mobs and one of your party needs a heal.&nbsp; You heal and
          quickly gain the unwanted attention of&nbsp; a mob (healing their enemy often makes them
          hate you more).&nbsp; Suddenly you need to heal, but are getting pounded and can't get off
          that long heal.&nbsp; <em>Root</em> the mob, step out of range, and cast your spells.
          &nbsp; This can also be applied to the next example.</li>
        <li><em>Root and nuke</em>.&nbsp; Surely you've seen wizards soloing and doing this, and if
          those brainy wizards are doing it, there must be a good reason, right?&nbsp; It's quite
          simple, just root your target, and nuke it to slag.&nbsp; What's that?&nbsp; It's so easy
          it feels like cheating?&nbsp; If you aren't bleeding some it bothers you?&nbsp; Get over
          it and enjoy it :).&nbsp; There are many times when you will not be able to do it (that is
          actually the norm).&nbsp; However, it works great at many of the popular spawn spots such
          as&nbsp; the Chessboard against those undead pawns, the mummy camp in Lesser Faydark.</li>
        <li>When it's time to bug-out, <em>root</em>ing can hold that mob in place allowing you and
          your party time to escape.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A couple of notes about root.<ol>
        <li>It is frequently resisted, especially against mobs of your level or higher.&nbsp; Don't
          despair, just try again.&nbsp; If you are fighting in a place where the monsters need to
          be held, just spend the mana and get it done.</li>
        <li>It does have a variable duration.&nbsp; Sometimes it will hold for 30 or more seconds,
          sometimes, just a few.</li>
        <li>It will often make the monster go aggro on you if you do it too early.</li>
        <li>Depending upon the difficulty of your monster, you may want to wait a bit before
          rooting.&nbsp;&nbsp; This, of course, depends upon your group composition, what you are
          fighting, the number of mobs, etc., but in a group with tanks fighting blue or greater
          mobs it's usually not necessary to root the mob until it's down 1/2 or so.&nbsp; On the
          other hand, if you have a wizard who is nuking you may want to root it immediately. &nbsp;
          I have seen wizards neglect this much to their regret....</li>
