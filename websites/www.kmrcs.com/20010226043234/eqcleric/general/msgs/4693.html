Yeah, that's kinda how it happened with me originally too, I was level 17 there with my guild and he spawned twice in one night and we killed him both times, and he dropped the ring.  This was before the quest was really even known.  I traded it a few levels later once the quest got popular... =(<p>Kommos<p><p><br>: wow not to make ya feel bad, <br>: I was in befallen with my lev18 necro and a lev16 cleric was with me. Gynok spawned and we ran to the top level and he was runnin towards me right inside door1. hehehe I dotted him with all my might and pet was a thrashing.. he was beatin me down and the cleric was nonstop healing me ) WE killed him and he dropped the ring. funny when you ARENT looking for it you run into it. I have looked with my 37 cleric before for hours and never got it. DOH!!!!!<p>: <br>: : Man, been camping gynok forever now and he hasn't spawned once... =(  I had his ring once a long time ago but traded it away for a charred guardian sheild.  Now, 15 levels later I almost regret it...  Anyone have any advice on getting him to show up sometime soon?<p>: : Kommos<p>
