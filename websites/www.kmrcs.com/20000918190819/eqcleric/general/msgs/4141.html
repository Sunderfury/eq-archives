Granted, this isn't as much of a problem with the caster types (tho it is still a problem), but the warrior who is armorless and weaponless is at a serious disadvantage as is the party who is relying on him.<p>This game definitely rewards 'zone border campers'. Since, IMO, the key to levelling is not getting killed (as opposed to getting *great* xp), I've almost completely stopped going deep into dungeons unless I have a great party. I much prefer to stay in outdoor areas now - the xp and certainly loot may not be as good, but the risk of death is greatly reduced and in the long run, I come out ahead.<p>
