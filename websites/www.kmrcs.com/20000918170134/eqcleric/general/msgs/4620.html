Since I recently posted the conundrum between WIS vs. Manna, I just want to say that 10 manna per +1WIS is only valid at lvl 50-otherwise see my previous post (My cont. Obsession with WIS/Manna) for the breakdown per level.<p>And my SIDENOTE: I never bitch about Clerics. I love my cleric, andI am always looking to maximize his abilities. <p><p>: Heres the breakdown.  before 200 WIS you get about 10 mana per point.  after 200 WIS you get about 1.5 mana per WIS point.  So all you ppl bitching about PoF armor etc get over it.  I played a Human (yes human) up to 50.  With my PoF armor, all the rest of my EQ my Wis sits nicely at 202 and i STILL can strip EQ to balance and raise other stats.  Having anymore WIS than 200 is simply a waste!  I'd rather the other 50 points get dist between my dex and agi.  Which is what ive done.  SIDE NOTE:  Im tired about ppl bitching about how clerics suck at this we suck at that.  If you dont like it go play another class.  Simple fact is tho after you play another class or 3 youll see that CLERICS ARE THE FUNNEST TO PLAY.<p>
