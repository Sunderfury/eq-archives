Well, seeing as how I am a warrior I think I can shed some light on this topic.  I have continually grouped with a cleric since level 1 (I am in fact the warrior partner of Danof who posted a rely to this also) (and before you ask yes I have also grouped with other caster classes (all of them to be exact)) Now, as for supporting any tank class(of which I have played three of the tank classes (3 warriors an SK and a palli)) clerics are simply the best.  They are the best at keeping me alive due to a) the heals b) the HP AC buffs and c) the fact that if need be I can step out of the fight and let the cleric tank for a short while because lets face it a clerics melee is as good as any other casters and no other caster can even come close to the AC of a warrior except for clerics.<p>Now here is the order in which I look for casters to group with (when playing my warrior).<p>1.  Cleric (not a problem since I am always on with Danof)<p>2.  Enchanter (very good DD and alacrity and good utility spells)<p>3. Shaman or Bard(I know not a true caster but better in every way compared to duids when in a large group) <p>4. Magician (good all around spell selection)<p>5.  Necromancer (undisputed lords of DoT but those pets are kinda creepy :-)<p>6.  Wizard (yes I would take a necro over a wiz.  necroes are less likely for a mob my group is fighting to become agro on them and when the mob does agro onto the wiz because they nuked to fast they bitch at me when they die for not taunting it off them)<p>7.  Druid (yes last horrible AC (only leatherish armor) worse DD than wiz worse DoT than necro and shaman and bards can cast speed spells/songs)

: 3. Shaman or Bard(I know not a true caster but better in every way compared to duids when in a large group)
