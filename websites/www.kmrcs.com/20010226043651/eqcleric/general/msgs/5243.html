<br>: : As for "Blinding Flash," I don't recall a spell like that.  Do you mean "Flash of Light?"  If so I didn't buy that because I thought it was a waste of time.  I heard that it blinds the enemy but only for a few seconds so is it REALLY worth the money?<p>: I can never remember the name properly :).  Yes, it's worth it.  MOBs start missing you a lot more with it.<br>Remember clerics are great against undead. Solo them like I did. <br>
