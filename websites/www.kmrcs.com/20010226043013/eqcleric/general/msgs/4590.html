Fortunately this has not been the norm in my experience, but they certainly are the people who get noticed.

They were getting killed (very quickly) by a DB skel and was yelling for help. Rather than try healing them (since they were obviously outclassed and healing would have been pointless), I killed the DB with several expulses. This person then had the nerve to turn around and call me a kill stealer.<p>This type of situation is one of the good points of being a DE cleric...Nobody is expecting you to help, and if they complain that you didn't (or th e manner in which you did), you can have a bit of fun with the roleplaying (most of which is lost on the person yelling, but the people around you can have some fun with it too).<p>It will always be one of the pains that we have to suffer as casters, since we can do things that others can not, some of them will always expect that it is their right to demand whatever service they need in order to make up for some shortcoming in their class.<p>
