: i think you should go play a Warrior like the guy below Karak or whatever his name was.  You obviously have no clue how to play a Cleric.  Yeah sitting and medding all the time sucks at times...sorry healing and buffing is our job, everything else is secondary.  Quite simply at high levels it is VERY difficult if not impossible for a group to take on many of the nice Mobs in the game... try taking a frenzied ghoul or any of the 45+ named froggies in Lower Guk without a cleric. Im not saying it can't be done mind u, it can. <p>: Playing a Cleric can be an extremely rewarding class.  Take for example last night>>LGuk, We pulled the Ghoul Arch Magi (high level wizard froggy) and the room we were camped in decided to start spawning, we ended up with I think the Magi, a kor wizard, a Zol and Dar knight, trust me this got extremely ugly, without a Cleric the party would have been wasted period, I brought our tank back from less then half bub of life about 3 xs with complete along with the heals on other party members and of course getting the crap knocked out of me for doing the healing. We all lived and killed everything. My point is tho, after the fight the 1 comment I remember was "you rock" and everyone else in my party commented on what a good job on healing was done.  that after battle praise is a clerics reward, thats what we get paid for ;-)<p>: the Cleric class doesnt suck, some people who play Clerics do<p>: Lucas Lightbringer<br>: 48th Cleric<br>: (Combine)<br>: Karana Server<p>
