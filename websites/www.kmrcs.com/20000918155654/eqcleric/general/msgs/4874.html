: Of the 4 abilities that aid in shortening a combat or running away:<br>: (DOT, Debuffs, SOW, and Dmg Shields) a cleric has none and a Shaman or Druid has 3 of the 4...<p>: you do the math...<p>I would like to meet the warriors that you hang out with.  I wouldn't want to group with a warrior who is more concerned with running away than with fighting, if he's not confident with his skills then how can i be?  And i'm sure any warrior would appreciate a healer burning all of their mana nuking/DOTing a MOB instead of healing.  I assume people play warriors because they LIKE melee.. most warriors that i group with are the headstrong, lay-it-on-the-line kind of people that warriors should be and would prefer to have melee last a bit longer, even if it means they need a heal once in a while.  The point is a GOOD cleric warrior group would not usually need to run away (unless you get trained on, in which case you probably should just be more careful in picking your camping spots) or use dd/dot's to kill something, that is what a wiz/mage does (although a cleric can too).  Even though the spells that a cleric gets early on are not always better than druids/shaman, the difference is the mentality that most clerics have.  A cleric will save mana for healing when a druid/shaman will throw it away on a DD or dot (which is useless as well since you said yourself combat is fairly quick at this level).  I'm not saying that druids or shaman are bad classes, they are very good ones actually,  but they don't replace a cleric when it comes to keeping someone alive. hands down a cleric is more able (both in abilities and mentality) to keep a warrior healthy.
