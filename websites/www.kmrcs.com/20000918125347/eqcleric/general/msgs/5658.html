I'm trying to sort out some of the rumors that I've been hearing about various aspects of these quests. I managed to get the Boots, and used 2 bars. Someone reported on this board that you only need one.. is there any truth to that?<p>Another question is, which piece is the Penitent?<p>Also, when giving the items to the NPC who gives the quest, do you keep the enchanted plat bars stacked? I know I gave the quest NPC the Ingot, Icon, and two platinum bars all seperate, and it gave me the boots. But what do you do if there are more than 4 components? Do you give 4, click give then give the rest? Or do you just keep the plat bars stacked?<p>Thanks in advance,<p>Selphie - Circle Noir<br>Tallon Zek
