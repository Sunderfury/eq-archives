: some even saying (both cleric and non-clerics) that clerics are the best PvP (single or grouped).
: Heres the reasons why:
: High hps.
: Wear very good armor.
: Very good pvp buffs. (AC,HP,Resist)
: Some melee skill
: Great pvp spells:
:    Root
:    Blinding Lunminance
:    Fear
:    Stun
:    DA,DB (highly underated)
:    Gate/Bind
:    Summon food,water,weapon
: DA and DB spell gives you an advantage over all other class. If in trouble and going down you can hit this spell and pack all your killer armor/weapons/items. So cleric and clerics alone can feel very safe walking around wearing some good stuff. 
: Most one-on-one battles with clerics are Stun, Blind, DD,...continue if a caster...if not then maybe layoff stunning everytime and root every now and then.
: Also if im not mistaken Atone wipes you off their target list. This can be useful for blinded caster.


:  Overall Clerics (solo) are very poor at PvP.We do not have the offensive capability to be able to kill our opponents.On the other hand due to the vaious spells available to us we are extremely hard to kill and can almost always get away.
: : Our abilities can be summarised as:-

: : vs Int Caster a Cleric should win
: : vs Melee Just run you can't win but neither can they.
: : vs Priest class depends on tactics.

: : 
: : In a PvP Team things are different,Clerics (we are a group class) excell.We have at our disposal:-

: : Fol- Confuses the enemy
: : Fear- Reduce the odds
: : Root-Stop runners
: : Stun-Stop Casters
: : DA-if they target you
: : Limited DD- Only useful for finishing

: : and the 2 most important items
: : BUFFS- Really annoys opponent when spells get resisted and even your own casters appreciate a couple of hundred more HP

: : Healing-The longer the team fights the more damage it does.

: : PS My PvP experience is from a no Loot Guildwar so everyone had best gear on.
