: It's posted several times earler, but here goes.  I got it on Wednesday Night.  He spawns in the room next to where the SK that has barbed legs is.  If you think about the room there it has a room to the left and one to the right, with the SK room the small one in between.  Babbinsbort is in the room to the left.  He spawns behind the fallen pillar.  Just not always, I camped there for 3 hours and gave up and left.  I came back later that night, he was there.  <p><br>Also, the female dark elf SK spawned in the hall just outisde this room, instead of her normal spot on the other side.<p><p>
