Enough whining already everyone ! Verant does something that at least heads in the right direction with EQ and all I hear is incessant whining about it ! Just about all the quest armor is NOT primary stat raising. For the most part this armor was to provide something to search for that was available between most of the easily attainable and the PoF armors. Did you hear people whining about rubicite sucking? No. Most of the quest armor is better than rubicite which people were willing to camp days or weeks for. I think Verant did a very good thing with the way they added these quests in. I just wish ALL the quest armors were no drop to prevent farming of certain ones for profit. If you do not like the armor, DON'T WEAR IT !  Pretty much all the classes are whining about this and I am just sick of it.
