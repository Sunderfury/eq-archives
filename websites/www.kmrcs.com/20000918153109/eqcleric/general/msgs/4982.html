I feel your pain brother. As I posted below I believe that druids and shamans<br>are a better choice for the levels below 30. Clerics are still a good choice for <br>a party (don't get me wrong) but a druid or shaman is better.<p>I am however surprised that you have that much of a problem finding<br>a group at high levels. I assume you are high level since your going to guk and<br>SolB looking for a group.  Perhaps you are taking the wrong tack.  Try starting a group.<br>"Level XX group looking for a tank and a nuker..."<br>do a /who all xx yy to find people in your range and start /telling.<p>If your not in a guild join one. Any guild would want a high level cleric...<p>best I can suggest.  <p>on soloing it can be done at most any level.  If you will give your level perhaps someone<br>on the board could point you to a good soloing spot.  Of course clerics can't solo like Druids or<br>Shaman at the mid high levels (until 44).  Most of my soloing is doing experience giving greens.  <br>The best option for exp is a 2 person group.  Get a tank of a bit lower level. (trust me I always see <br>high level tanks sitting on their butts) and hit a target either outside or by a zone<br>in a dungeon.  I have found it a lot easier to get a small group than a full group to go dungeon exploring.<p>good luck and hope you stick with it<br>
