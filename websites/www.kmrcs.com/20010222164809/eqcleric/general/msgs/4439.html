: : Sounds great since I rarely use my weapon anyway.

: Aye, and you can put it in either hand.

: : Someone was offering a silver ring for this quest...how valuable is that?

: Arguablly, this is probably the least worthy of the 4 rings required since it involves zero killing of a mob.  Would _I_ personally pay for it? Probably not since I know where to get it.

: : Is the Paw no-trade?  If so, who can do the quest?

: It is tradeable, but it is Lore.  Anybody can do the quest.  Even evil races, you just have to know where to go and dodge a couple of guards.

: Hmm, how do I outline the quest without giving up too much info?  Well, first off, for a full spoiler you can go to Allakazam's site.  I'll try to give you an over view here.

: Basically, the paw is a container which will require four rings to activate it's magical powers.  You will need to aquire yourself this paw as well as the four rings.  Some rings are easier to find than others as they may be on regularly spawning critters.  However, at least one of the rings is EXTREMELY rare.
