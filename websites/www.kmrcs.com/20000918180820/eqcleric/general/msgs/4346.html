: To be a best cleric I always learn how other class work.  So I tried all those I know less.  It's nice to learn how a encharter mes, how a bard sing 2 songs, how a warrior sit after battle, how a druid track blah blah blah..

: But end up I love my druid for she got so many skill.  DD, Dot, Demage shield, Buff, Heal, Travelling Gate, Charm, Harmory, Sow, Wolf-form... Great to solo relax afk, quest hunting and as a travelling vendor.

: Necro is my new toy made last night.  They are the neighbour and opposite of cleric.  /pet attack just like a RC car and feels so cool.  Dot melee pet taunt works excellent with good tactics.  I feel he will be 16 quick.

: When tried of holiness and grouping, try a necro if you're evil enough.  Try a druid if not.
