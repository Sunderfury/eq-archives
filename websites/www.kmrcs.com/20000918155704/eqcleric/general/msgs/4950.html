<br>A battle is not a foregone conclusion.  If your taking on anything but<br>easy kills (in which case why are you grouping to begin with) then sometimes<br>things go wrong.  Your warrior misses for 5 rounds in a row. you get 3 resists in a row<br>on your DD spell, whatever.  In this case a normally predictable fight becomes a nailbiter.<br>This is when sow, (or gate, but your cleric can't gate you can he) really helps out.<p>You also mentioned that DOT's didn't have time to really affect a battle. Obviously you never team<br>with a necro or shaman (whose DOT's are about on par with each other, druid ranks 2nd).  The druid more <br>than compensates for his lesser DOT's with a dmg shield and his DD which is better than either of them.<br>The last 2 changes have decreased the total time a DOT runs and added a tick of dmg.<br>DOT's work best when a tank is tanking for you now.  I do agree that a shaman is a better partner than a druid<br>for 2 reasons<br>1) Better Tank due to racial abilities.<br>2) Buffs (although the effect is limited for some till after level20)<p>but either one is better than a cleric.  Especially at the levels where the healing is tied.<p>again this all changes at high levels when the damage done IN battle requires healing.<p>

: A battle is not a foregone conclusion.  If your taking on anything but
: easy kills (in which case why are you grouping to begin with) then sometimes
: things go wrong.  Your warrior misses for 5 rounds in a row. you get 3 resists in a row
: on your DD spell, whatever.  In this case a normally predictable fight becomes a nailbiter.
: This is when sow, (or gate, but your cleric can't gate you can he) really helps out.

: You also mentioned that DOT's didn't have time to really affect a battle. Obviously you never team
: with a necro or shaman (whose DOT's are about on par with each other, druid ranks 2nd).  The druid more 
: than compensates for his lesser DOT's with a dmg shield and his DD which is better than either of them.
: The last 2 changes have decreased the total time a DOT runs and added a tick of dmg.
: DOT's work best when a tank is tanking for you now.  I do agree that a shaman is a better partner than a druid
: for 2 reasons
: 1) Better Tank due to racial abilities.
: 2) Buffs (although the effect is limited for some till after level20)

: but either one is better than a cleric.  Especially at the levels where the healing is tied.

: again this all changes at high levels when the damage done IN battle requires healing.
