I was bored on Saturday night and I was near Ak'anon so I went to the mino caves and played Helper-Dwarf to the little folks hunting there.<p>The folks hunting there were in their mid-teens at best.  There were 3 in the mines when I got there and I started casting valor on everyone and helping out when they pulled too much.  When the mino guards came out I'd kill them off and everyone was terribly happy.  It was a good time for all.  I like doing this and I try to make it a practice of having an evening like this at least once a week in different places (Befallen, BB, etc.).  I stay full in character and the night is better for everyone.<p>I asked those there (the crowd grew to about 15 under my guidance and they were eventually killing guards with just a few saving spells from me) that if they should see an icon/ingot to let me know and I would be most appreciative.  Everyone agreed and oddly enough there were no clerics in this group.  <p>Well, this went on for well over 2 hours.  Not a single sentry spawned during that time.  So even though I did the right thing and waited an inordinate amount of time, and I used that time to improve the lives of fellow players, I still have a total of ZERO to show from the new quests.  <p>I have visited Everfrost, Rathe Mts, Lake rathe, Kerra Isle, Mino caves and every single location of every quest piece known.  And after all of those hours,I have zilch.  <p>Then I se the new items posted on the sites.  And I find out teh stats on the breastplate.  And I see that I wouldn't trade my bloodstained tunic for both the breastplate and the boots together.  So I am officially out of quest mode.   Not gonna waste even 10 seconds on these quests anymore.  I only have one piece of armor that I would trade for the new armor is my gloves.  My only piece of non-magic armor, steel.<p>I prefer my bloodstained tunic, dwarven workboots, gatorscale legs, azure sleeves, adamintine epolets, runed crown and 2 mithril bracers to the new armor.

I hope that they make a new high +wis headpiece that looks like nothing or even leather.

Everyone agreed and oddly enough there were no clerics in this group.  

: Well, this went on for well over 2 hours.  Not a single sentry spawned during that time.  So even though I did the right thing and waited an inordinate amount of time, and I used that time to improve the lives of fellow players, I still have a total of ZERO to show from the new quests.
