    <strong>Aguth, Rallos Zek (<a href="#Comments from Dallben" style="color: #0000FF">comments
    </a> by Dallben, Tarew
    Marr)</strong></p>
    <p><strong>1st</strong> some important information. &nbsp; If you are going to meditate in
    here make sure all the greens around you are dead. Things that normally would ignore you
    will attck if you are in range and meditate.&nbsp; </p>
    <p><strong>2nd</strong> there is no completely safe place in befallen. &nbsp; Outside the
    dungeon there are a couple of NPC's that spawn that are level 18+, if you rest by the zone
    you can usually zone before they kill you.&nbsp; If you rest right inside the zone
    sometimes a dry bone skeleton or ghoul appears on the top level and they are for levels 17
    or so.&nbsp; Also there is a named mummy that walks the dungeon from time to time, he
    yells a lot about coming to kill everyone so you ussually can zone to avoid him.</p>
    <p><strong>3rd</strong> Locked doors, there is a locked door leading to each new level,
    you need to kill a shadowknight to get the key to unlock the door. &nbsp; The
    shadowknights are usually a good indication, if you can't kill the shadowknight don't go
    to the next level.&nbsp; They key to 3rd level is a no rent item!&nbsp; Do not camp on the
    third level!</p>
    <p><strong>4th</strong> Traps- there is a well on first level that leads to a nasty point
    in the 3rd level&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't go look down the well because you'll probablyfall
    in.&nbsp; In one of the shadowknight rooms in the 2nd level there is a pit leading to the
    3rd level.&nbsp; If you fall in this you'll be in a safe room, so<br>
    either gate out or give a shout and ask if anyone can come help you get out.&nbsp; If you
    have the key to 3rd level and want to<br>
    make a run for it, open the door to the room and hang a left, follow the wall to the left
    until you enter a small circular area with a door, thats the door back to second level.</p>
    <p><br>
    <strong>Level 1</strong> - This area is solo all the way.&nbsp; Every cleric should go
    here from level 7-9 IMO.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Skeletons - lvl 6-9</strong>.&nbsp; These are your basic run of the mill
      skeletons I wouldn't advise hunting them until level 7 since sometimes they are linked.<br>
      <strong>Decaying Skeletons, Wimpy Skeletons&nbsp; </strong>lvl 3-5&nbsp;&nbsp; These are
      just cannon fodder.&nbsp; Most likely if you can hunt in here they won't give experience,
      I usually kill them just so a skeleton can replace them and I can get the loot.<br>
      <strong>Rats</strong> - lvl 4-8 there are some various types of rats in here they are
      generally pretty easy but the plague rats can disease you.&nbsp; I kill them just to avoid
      the meditation problems.<br>
      <strong>Skeleton Lordd</strong> - lvl 13-16&nbsp; This is the toughest thing you'll find
      on this level, he might even give experience at 17th level I'm not sure.&nbsp; He doesn't
      usually have any loot but he's some easy experience if you can take him.<br>
      <strong>Shadowknight</strong> - not sure what level this guy is, I'd say around 7-10.
      &nbsp; He has a pet so he can be tough since you are basically fighting 2 creatures in
      one.<br>
      <strong>Necro Initiate</strong> - not sure what level, just be warned that necros are
      always tougher than they con.&nbsp; If he's blue to you your going to have your hands full
      going solo.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Level 2</strong> - lvl 12-16.&nbsp; You can find some things to hunt at lower
    levels but I wouldn't advise it.&nbsp; A group of 3 15th level people is perfect down here
    IMO.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Zombie</strong> - lvl&nbsp; 8-11&nbsp; These are pretty easy, and give little
      experience.<br>
      <strong>Lesser mummy</strong> - lvl 13-16&nbsp; These can hit pretty hard.&nbsp; They also
      give rabies so have a cure disease ready.&nbsp; They sometimes carry bronze weapons (joy).<br>
      <strong>Large Skeleton</strong> - lvl 8-11&nbsp; These are just harder skeletons.<br>
      <strong>Greater Skeleton</strong> lvl 12-15&nbsp; These hit very hard, they con easier
      than mummies but are just as hard.&nbsp; They also sometimes carry bronze weapons or
      raw-hide armor.<br>
      <strong>Woman Shadowknight</strong> lvl ? - Only fought her with a 15th level ranger, she
      was green and pretty easy.&nbsp; The pt to 3rd level is in her room.<br>
      <strong>Ogre Shadowknight</strong> lvl 13-16&nbsp; This guy can be pretty hard. He likes
      to run away a lot and he moves pretty fast for a big old fat ogre.&nbsp; To get to him you
      need to get a key from the woman shadowkngiht.&nbsp; He also occasionally
      drops the barbed arms.<br>
      <strong>Necro Acolyte</strong> lvl 13-16&nbsp; again these guys will con easier than they
      are.&nbsp; There DOT spells are nasty and they will heal nearby undead that you are
      fighting.<br>
      <strong>Willowisp</strong> - lvl 12-15&nbsp; These are pretty easy for fighters with magic
      weapons.&nbsp; This variety of wisp tends to resist spells a lot more than any other I've
      found.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><br>
    <strong>Level 3</strong> - lvl 17-22, I've hunted down here in a group of 16th level
    people and we died just a bit too often, did pretty well and didnt' have a cleric.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><br>
      <strong>Elf Skeleton</strong> -&nbsp; This guy hits hard, I dont' think you need magic to
      hit him though, I've only fought him one time so I'm not sure.<br>
      <strong>Ice Boned Skeleton</strong> - These are pretty easy IMO, Biggest problem with them
      is they are magic only, they cast frost spells as well.<br>
      <strong>Necro Theurugist</strong> -&nbsp; These guys cast nasty DD, they con green at
      level 16 but don't be fooled, they are tougher than they look.&nbsp; There is a Eurudite
      Necro that drops the Gossamer Robe.<br>
      <strong>Ogre ShadowKnight</strong> - This guy is nasty. He drops the bone bladed claymore.<br>
      <b>Dark Elven ShadowKnight</b> - Approximately level 17, she sometimes
      drops the Barbed Legs.<br>
      <strong>Ghoul</strong> -&nbsp; These are magic only and they carry a lot of punch. They
      hit for up to 40 damage a hit.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><br>
    Well thats all I know about befallen, its a good dungeon for a group of 2 or 3 of the
    proper level but its small.&nbsp; If you do a /who and see 40+ people I'd suggest hunting
    elsewhere.<br>

    <p><strong><a name="Comments from Dallben">Comments from Dallben</a></strong></p>
    <p>Here are a few additions, notes and 1 correction.</p>
    <p>Just a note for bronze weapons:&nbsp; I only got 3 bronze weapon in the 2 weeks I was
    there and I only got them from ghouls.&nbsp; I killed TONS of mummies and greater skeles,
    but no bronze.&nbsp; Maybe I was unlucky, but just thought I would throw that out.</p>
    <p>As for necros, you are correct in saying they are tougher than they appear. In all the
    groups I fought with, we ALWAYS killed the necro first, NO MATTER WHAT ELSE WAS ATTACKING
    US.&nbsp; That should tell you how tough they can be.</p>
    <p>One correction I saw was that you mentioned a dry bone skeleton appearing on the first
    level.&nbsp; I have never seen a dry bone skele in Befallen, but I do know that ice bone
    skeles spawn right next to the zone on the first level. I am assuming that is what you
    meant.</p>
    <p>As for the gossamer robes, there is a Theurogist, kinda like the head necro, that drops
    the robes.&nbsp; He does NOT have necro before his name.&nbsp; As for the BBC, the troll
    sk on level 3 drops the bbc.</p>
    <p>No, the elf skele does not require magical weapons to hit.</p>
    <p>There is also a lvl 20+ zombie named Commander Windstream which is part of a
    quest.&nbsp; If anyone shouts that he is loose, ZONE IMMEDIATELY if you are below lvl
    18-20.&nbsp; He is quite like Dvinn from Crushbone from the few encounters I had with
    him.&nbsp; He hits hard and fast.</p>
