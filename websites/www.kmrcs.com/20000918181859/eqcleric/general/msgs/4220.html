You are not half tank, you are not even quarter tank (but are close).  Even though we may have quite a few HPs, and can wear plate does not mean we are tanks.  The fighting class has the skills to keep them alive : Parry, Ripsote, Dodge, etc.  Yes we do get dodge but it stopped increasing at good.  You can tank for very limited amounts of time.  I am a Dark Elf Cleric lvl32, and the only time I tank is when there is no other tank class around, and the rest of the group are casters who can kill a mob quickly.  Actually I dont even really tank, I just pull, root the mob they are attacking, tank the others and just keep healing myself while the casters do the work.  Works fairly well most of them time, but I have been known to die from this.  We are not tanks, but can fill the roll for very limited times.  You are not half warrior, you are 100% Cleric a pure casting class that has good hps and can wear plate armor.<p><br>Dalcimer Addo'Invisus<br>lvl32 Cleric of Innrouuk<br>Karana Server
