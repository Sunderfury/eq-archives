: Apparently this guy has never fought the undead wizards in lower guk who will be most happy to nuke his sorry little dwarven ass for 400-600 points a hit. Lets see...thats 2 greater heals, while the wizzie will be most happy to fire off yet another nuke. I'd like to see how long he would live then.

: Or maybe the Kobold king in Sol B who will HT for 400-600 and double hit for 100's.

: This is obviously some low lvl warrior that's just out to provoke us cause he's bored or something.

: Now, i *know* that a cleric is needed in lower guk, and sol b - so do the rest of you. So why bother even arguing with this guy?

: Also, look at all the lvl 40+ mobs, they dual hit for around 95-130, which will drain your little shaman / druid's mana pretty damn quick with their gheals - which would be better spent trying to damage the mob, cause a lvl 40 mob will hand even a lvl 50 warrior his ass in a bag.

: If you read the posts people make about the raid on nagafen and vox - the class that people praise the most are always the clerics.

: Now Torak - Would you like to have a shaman / druid heal you for 300 point a cast when Nagafen / Vox dual hits for 225 a hit and kicks for 90's and has an AE spell that does 600's...or would you like a cleric to go with that?
