Why i'm trying to shield them after they blasted me the way they did I don't know but anyway - it was 1 individual as to what they were doing - beats me - it was blue to me and they were 19 so that means it was at least white if not yellow. I couldn't really see what they were doing once I engaged the croc (just a short little dwarf here so when the big ole croc turned and started attacking me - can't see much except for a face full of teeth).  So I don't know what they were doing while I was attacking.  Probably still trying to get in the kill at the time.<p><p>: Did you ask why 2 low lvls attacked a non-agro croc that probably /con'd white and they may not have been ready? If they were ready (FM/HP/Buffs) and it was less then white...why was it kicking thier butt? At 17 I could amost solo a DW croc if I did root and nuke first to get it to like half life or less before it engaged then time my blasts between the hits. If things went bad I would try to stun and fear...or DA and run. These guys were what? 2 lvl 19's? Obviously they don't know how to play if they can't kill a DW croc as a team at that lvl with help.  They should atleast know how to run away. Granted thier options are more limited if a mage type they still hve gate...most likely a stun or root to let them get gate off.  Monks have feign. Sk have HT. Paladins have LoH.  Only rogues and warriors have an excuse for dying to a non-agro blue in a team situation.<p>: I think they should have been mad at themselves.  They got themselves killed, you had nothing to do with it.  But most idiots don't know it's them..they are the idiots! They blame everyone but themselves.<p>: When I did I usually say something like "it's OK I burnt to hard it was my fault", "I should have been further back", "I was going to die anyway thanks for trying","there were just too many", or the ever popular "hehe, that sucked".<p>: It just so happens you tried to help the 70%'rs. Which was more then required. If they get mad do as you did and /ignore them.<p>: Did the monkey try to back out of the fight once you engaged? Or did the monkey wait for his turn to die...swinging his sword to get the one kill?<p>: If so he was trying to use you to power-level and he failed......<p>: If I am low on health and ask for help I don't mind if the guy gets the kill.  If my helper starts to lose I will jump back in and help.  But if you are low on HP....wait for a heal or for the helper to draw attention off you. Before proceeding with anything to taunt the mob.<p>: The guy was a moron.<p>
