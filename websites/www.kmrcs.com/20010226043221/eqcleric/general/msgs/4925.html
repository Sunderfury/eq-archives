Yea Flash of Light can be very useful in interrupt mobs healer.  Once you see "a orc priest starting to cast a spell", cast the FoL to it at once.  Since FoL is a fast spell you can mostly interrupt their casting.  You can also hot key the spell so it comes handy and fast enough.<p>Spook the dead can also save life from those nasty ghoul root.  However you probably don't have the spare slot to mem it.  If you have a polly let him mem it.<p>Make sure you know how to use Divine Aura and Root too.
