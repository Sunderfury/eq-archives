And that is why you want one.  Ok, clarity is nice too ).  But situations like these are what enchanters are FOR.  Group of Five, Tank pulls 5.  Group has no enchanter.  5 Mobs group together on one cleric (funny the AI understands this tactic but PC's do not), beat it into oblivion, leaving the group to die a quick and painfull death.  Ouch.  Group finds an enchanter (and not one that thinks he is a wizzard).  Tank again pulls 5 mobs.  Enchanter casts one spell.  Every mob but the one being hit (hopefully, we all use assist and there is only ONE being hit here), is now mesmerized for 30 seconds.  Pwhew.  From here, your group can systematically destroy all targets pulled, one by one, with relative ease.  Group kills one, move to the next.  Wizzards dont need to dump mana to save their hides.  Clerics can freely heal without fear of being hit (at least not for long, targeting can be tricky =P).  Bards can also do this to some extent..in some ways better and in some ways worse.  But IMO, to be successfull in this game you have to be able to control your fights.  Im going to guess you have a fairly well rounded melee group.  Probably have some type of mage casting spells for damage and/or support.  Problem is your group has no efficient means of "crowd control".   The higher you get, the worse it gets and the more important this becomes.  The only way to do this is with an enchanter (admitttedly I am *very* biased).  Ok, enchanters are tough to group with.  We think very highly of ourselves (=P), and tend to ask alot of our group in what they do/do not do  (do NOT hit anything but main target please...clerics please dont defend yourselves..wizzards PPLLLLEEEEAAASSSSSEEE dont dump all your mana in 2 seconds), but it is all for a reason.  Just try it some time.  You will be amazed at what your same group can do with an enchanter added in.  Trust me =P<br>
