The single biggest flailing, is making clerics stand in line,, just so they can be NEXT to stare at the ground for 7 hours. I don't mind, that our armor isn't quite as sweet as the bards or rangers.  They're melee types, they SHOULD get better.  <p>Most of the others quests,, are based around killing a specific type of mob until you're lucky enuf to get that specific drop you need.  This is why magicians are out in droves in Cazic Thule, looking for Gold Rings and/or brooms out of the gators.  At least these folks have something to do.  <p>I've spent the past 2 days in Upper Guk, camping the water tower, & have been unlucky.  Either, someone takes it when I'm AFK, or I get too bored & just get up & run around to break the monotony. <br>I don't wanna kill frogs, because I'm working hard to keep a good faction w/ them.  <p>Frankly, I'm already so bored, I've all but given up.  Fix the boredom, & restore the interest.<p>Tomma Trueheart<br>Priestess of Mithaniel Marr, 26th Rosary<br>
