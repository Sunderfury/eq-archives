A group of friends in EQ helped powerlevel a bard and an enchanter.  It was REALLY boring, but after a week or so of helping them kill MOBs (green to us, but yellows and reds to them) we had a 2 great additions to our guild and our party.  These 2 rarely will group with others their level because they are so loyal to us now.  I have mana song or clarity whenever I go hunting now.<p>Some of their skills did need a lot of work after this, but that was taken care of pretty easily.  We would get a low blue con (of course you can't tell by conning it, but experience told us that it was a rather easy blue).  We had our warriors and ranger continually taunt it while I rooted so the bard could attack and the enchanter could cast spells on it.  It was red to them at the time, and with the int items we gave them, the skills SOARED up there.  If the MOB turned on them, I would atone it and let the melee types taunt- repeat as needed :)  We never did any damage to it, and noone died :)  Of course I did have to heal our tanks a couple of times, but it was fairly easy to do.  The enchanter just cast spells on herself over and over (or on low greens to her) to get the rest of her skilss up while the bard played his songs, they took a 1/2 hour break (to watch TV) while we made sure nothing attacked them.<p>With one cleric to buff (I took our level 20 bard who had below 400 or so hp and gave him over 900 with all the hp and ac buffs, and a couple others to watch our backs it's easy to power level other peeps.  These two are now level 38 and level 36, so lower guk with a couple of 40s is a good group :)  Of course we did have to go help them camp some items, that was a pain. . . .<p>. . . Hmmm, payback time- I think I'm going to make them camp Mitty and Gynok for me :)
