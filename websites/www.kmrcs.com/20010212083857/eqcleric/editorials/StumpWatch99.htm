      <p align="center">or what Verant should do about our armor quests</p>
      <p>This editorial is not a rant directed at Verant; instead, it is a list
      of what Verant did right and what they didn't do right in implementing the
      new quests, specifically the cleric quests.&nbsp; It also contains a list
      of suggestions that would, in my opinion, improve both the cleric quests
      and the overall game.&nbsp; Furthermore, this is not a petition.&nbsp;
      There is a petition on the net, available at <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~remage/" style="color: #0000FF">http://www.mindspring.com/~remage/
      </a>
      .&nbsp; I agree with many of the points, but not all.&nbsp; I also don't
      agree with the tone of the petition.</p>
      <p>This weekend I had the distinct &quot;pleasure&quot; to participate in
      what I call <i>Stump Watch 99.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; What is <i>Stump Watch</i>
      you ask?&nbsp; It is a name derived from some our quests, one of which has
      an item that spawns on top of a stump in Kithicor forest.&nbsp; What can
      be easier than picking up an item off the ground?&nbsp; Nothing, except
      that the item only spawns approximately every 7 hours.&nbsp; While
      participating in my own little segment of <i>Stump Watch</i> I had ample
      opportunity to not only read a lot of class-specific message boards, but
      also think about the quests and what could be done to improve them.</p>
      <p><b><u><font size="4">What is good about the quests</font></u></b></p>
      <p>Nothing.&nbsp; Well, ok, seriously, there are some very good aspects to
      the quests.&nbsp; One is that players are extremely spread out at the
      moment.&nbsp; For example, there have been 30+ players actively hunting in
      Dagnor's Cauldron the last few nights.&nbsp; How often has the cauldron
      been used as anything other than a place to pass through on the way to
      Unrest?&nbsp; Anything Verant can do to increase utilization of all the
      zones is a good thing.</p>
      <p>Secondly, some of these quests are a lot of fun.&nbsp; I have helped
      two ranger friends complete four Ivy Bracers.&nbsp; This is a good
      quest.&nbsp; The mobs spawn frequently (Redwind seems to spawn every 10 -
      15 minutes) and many of the surrounding mobs gave me experience.&nbsp; I'm
      looking forward to the Ivy Tunic quest.&nbsp; I <b>much</b> prefer working
      on these quests than I would camping Rubicite.&nbsp; Sure, there will
      still be camping queues, but so far the ones I've participated in have
      been orderly and cordial.&nbsp; There was a certain amount of camaraderie
      displayed; I didn't feel the competition I normally feel at heavily
      contested spawn spots.&nbsp; This quest is a prime example of how they all
      should be.</p>
      <p><b><u><font size="4">What is not good about the quests</font></u></b></p>
      <p>First, many clerics are upset that the armor doesn't have better stats,
      specifically that it doesn't have more increases to wisdom.&nbsp; To an
      extent I agree; however, with one exception this armor is generally better
      than Rubicite.&nbsp; The one exception is the Rubicite Breastplate with
      the <i>Healing Aura</i> which I'll address later.&nbsp; The new bracers
      increase Wisdom by 5 each (for a total increase of 10).&nbsp; None of the
      other classes are getting better increases to their prime
      attributes.&nbsp; The disappointing part for us is that it comes on
      bracers.&nbsp; I personally would have much preferred that it be 5 each on
      the tunic and greaves.&nbsp; The increase of AC on those two items would
      have been much more valuable than on bracers.&nbsp; I think we need to cut
      Verant a bit of slack on the armor.&nbsp; Keep in mind they never promised
      us a pre-Plane of Fear suit.&nbsp; They promised class specific
      replacement armor for Rubicite.&nbsp; While it could have been better, it
      isn't awful either; it just isn't particularly desirable for a cleric
      interested in maximizing wisdom (and neither was Rubicite).</p>
      <p>Second, let me address the issue of <i>Stump Watch</i>.&nbsp; Or <i>Cabin
      Watch </i>or <i>Water Watch.</i>&nbsp; All three of these were a bad
      idea.&nbsp; A <b>real bad<i> </i></b>idea.&nbsp; The idea of quests, and
      the game, is to have fun.&nbsp; Dear Verant, nobody, and I mean <b>nobody<i>,
      </i></b>can tell me that watching a patch of static scenery for hours at a
      time is fun.&nbsp; Many of us players want to do the quests, and some of
      us will tolerate whatever you do in order to complete them, but please,
      re-think this one.&nbsp; If the seven hour spawn cycle is part of some
      master plan to keep down the quest armor count that's one thing, but give
      us a mob to kill.&nbsp; Better yet, why can't our quests be more like
      other class's quests.&nbsp; For example, to get the warrior greaves we
      went to Najena to kill Trazdon.&nbsp; Two hours later we left with the
      Dark Circlet necessary to complete the quest.&nbsp; By the way, the first
      hour was spent waiting for our turn.&nbsp; He spawned every 20 - 30
      minutes.&nbsp; Most of the crafted items don't even require a named mob to
      be killed, just a specific type of mob who has a chance of dropping the
      item.&nbsp; Why are clerical quests different?&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Third, alright, if <i>Stump Watch</i> isn't bad enough, who decided it
      would be a good idea to put the best wisdom enhancing item in the game on
      one of our quest mobs?&nbsp; Specifically Bilge, a mid 30s aqua goblin in
      Dagnor's Cauldron, drops either a +18 Wisdom totem or a +5 Wisdom belt
      along with our icon (or ingot? who cares).&nbsp; Come on Verant, don't
      make us compete with higher level players.&nbsp; After all, what do you
      think the life expectancy of that mob is going to be?&nbsp; If we aren't
      around when Bilge is dropped that's it, another six hours down the
      drain.&nbsp; What if the player who takes Bilge out doesn't even know
      about the quest?&nbsp; This is silly.&nbsp; I also hear Bilge runs real
      fast.&nbsp; It sounds to me as if this mob is <i>designed</i> for druids
      and shamans.</p>
      <p>Fourth, um, gee, thanks for giving us replacement armor for Rubicite,
      but, well, I want a chance at a breastplate too.&nbsp; The consequences of
      this decision are: Rubicite Breastplates are practically priceless now
      (I'm sure those who have one must be pleased) and Verant rewarded those
      who concentrated on leveling more quickly.&nbsp; Conversely, they punished
      the slower leveling players by removing their opportunity to acquire one
      of the premier items in the game.&nbsp; Not a good idea Verant.</p>
      <p><u><b>What do I recommend</b></u></p>
      <p>1) Eliminate <i>Stump Watch.&nbsp; </i>Specifically, make our quests
      much more similar to the warrior's crafted quests.&nbsp; Furthermore,
      don't make us track rare spawns (rare being one every 6 hours).&nbsp; Put
      our items on regular mobs and work out a percentage of that item being
      dropped.&nbsp; Our items are hardly special enough to justify the time
      involved.</p>
      <p>2) Take our items off named NPCs such as Bilge.&nbsp; Instead,
      implement #1.</p>
      <p>3) Put Rubicite <b>back</b> into the game.&nbsp; Just make it an
      extremely rare drop off high level (35+) mobs similar to the Box of Abu
      Kar and Black Pearls.&nbsp; It is unfair that those who do not level as
      fast (for whatever reason) lose out on the opportunity to loot the
      Rubicite Breastplate.</p>
      <p>4) Consider reworking the stat buffs on the armor a bit.&nbsp;
      Specifically for the cleric class, put the wisdom enhancements on the
      tunic and greaves.&nbsp; The existing wisdom-enhancing bracers are easily
      acquired, so putting the wisdom enhancement on the quest armor bracers is
      very disappointing.&nbsp; Let us clerics interested in enhancing wisdom
      wear plate on our chest and legs.&nbsp; That would be an outstanding
      reward for doing the quests.</p>
      <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
