This is all good advice.  Something that I would add is:<p>** Keep track of what the mob is attacking.  MOBs only seem to go aggrom on you if they are currently targeting the one you heal.

When you cast it, the mobs will return to whomever they were most pissed at befroe you got involved.<p><br>: 1) Make your party aware that healing taunts the MOBs around you.  Make a hotkey in big, bold letters to let them know you are being attacked.  Casters and melee types don't usually pay as much attention to group hps as we do.  They may not know you're in trouble until too late.  Inform your fighters that if they want healing, then they've got to protect you.<p>: 2) Try healing from a distance.  A lot of lower level MOB's have a small aggro range and won't attack you.  By level 24, it makes sense for the cleric not to be involved in melee anymore anyway.

It does no good for you to die.  Do what you can to save the group and then go.  Espcially in dungeons and especially after you get res spells, clerics are essential to corpse recovery.<p>: The best thing you can do is train your fighters to protect you.  A fighter without a cleric is a dead fighter.  Make sure they know (or at least believe) that is true.
