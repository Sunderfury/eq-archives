: Calm is a very effective spell and can be used to great effect but you must know the limits of the spell.<p>: Calm reduces the agrso range of the MOB, each spell in the line reduces the agrso range more.   When players say that MOBs are linked, what they are really saying is their agrso ranges are overlapping.  Too successfully pull from a pack of MOB's the spell will have to reduce the agrso radius of each so that they do not overlap on the one you are pulling.<p>: In some cases, no matter what spell you use, you cannot eliminate the overlap and thus are going to pull more than one.  As you get higher in level, the agrso range for MOB's has a natural reduction and this spells become more effective.<p>: Very few players know how to use Lull series effectively, if you master them it will make you an exceptional puller.<p>: I am attaching below a article I wrote for my guild on the subject:<p><br>:                           In every combat, the first thing that happens is usually the most important thing that<br>:                           happens, the Pull. One brave solo runs into the haunts of the evil MOB's and attempt to<br>:                           return to his party with a the number of MOBs that his party can successfully defeat. The<br>:                           success and failure of 50% of your combats will be determined before most of the party even<br>:                           sees the MOBs. Now, the question is begged, can some players pull successfully and other<br>:                           players not. Lets look at the game mechanics. <p>:                           For simplicity, I am going to describe agrso range with an example. Every player has an<br>:                           agrso range and the MOB has a similar one, consider it like an Umbrella. Now a level one<br>:                           player has an Umbrella the size of those you see over the tables at your local outdoor<br>:                           restuarant, they are huge. Now imagine trying to walk down the street carrying this umbrella<br>:                           and all the other people carrying the same umbrella. You are gonna run into a few and they<br>:                           are going to agrso on you. <p>:                           Now the higher level you get, the smaller the umbrella gets (i.e. the smaller radius around<br>:                           your character and the MOBS that is consider the agrso radius). A level 50 player has<br>:                           virtually no umbrella at all thus he can pull MOBs better than a lower level player. Bascially,<br>:                           each level you gain the umbrella of your character and the MOBs get smaller. So in general<br>:                           terms, the highest level player is always the best puller with certain exceptions. <p>:                           Now agrso linked, means having two or more MOBs whose umbrella's are overlapped.<br>:                           Remember this is relative to level, so three MOBs might be agrso linked if the puller is level<br>:                           20 but not if the player is level 30. Why?, because a level 20 umbrella is alot bigger than a<br>:                           level 30 umbrella. <p>:                           Now, lets get to the exceptions.. <p>:                           A level 45 warrior and a level 45 Ranger have the same agrso radius (i.e. there umbrella's are<br>:                           equal). The ranger has tools available to him, such as snare, that can make the pull easier to<br>:                           make. Classes like clerics have the lull series of spells. A lull spell basically reduces the<br>:                           size of the umbrella, for it to work successfully, the spell must reduce the size of the target's<br>:                           Umbrella so that it does not overlap that of other MOBs. <p>:                           Another thing I have noticed is that agrso checks are made at certain intervals, maybe every<br>:                           3 seconds. Which means that you can sometimes run by an aggresive MOB and he will not<br>:                           attack you because you managed to pass through his agrso range inbetween agrso checks.<br>:                           Thus it is always a good idea to try to move past these MOBs as quickly as possible. <p>:                           Finally, their is an agrso change at level 18. MOBs that are level 18 or lower, and that con<br>:                           green to you will have no agrso range. You can pass by them freely and not get attack (just<br>:                           dont meditate near them!). Once a MOB reaches level 19, he will be agrso to you regardless<br>:                           of your level. <p>:                           Hope I explained this in an understandable format) <p>
