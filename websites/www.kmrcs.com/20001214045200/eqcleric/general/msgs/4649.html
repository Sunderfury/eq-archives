Wow, did not trolls could be a cleric<br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<p>WTF is that?  A person, not able to form complete<br>sentences has NO BUSINESS correcting ANYONEs spelling, language syntax, or anything else possibly related to communication.  <p>Regarding the game, perhaps you've not noticed, but Bards do get Dual Wield. I'd say that qualifies them as a Dual Class char.  Much like the Paladin, Ranger or Shadowknight.  ALL Tank classes.  <p>Now, my question for you is,,, can you even READ the box?
