All I can say is first, I think it is Dark Elf Cleric only, so you should be in luck.  Second, you should learn some languages.  Mage types seem to need to know various languages to Research their spells.  You don't need to put a practice into a language to learn it, just get in a group with your teacher and have them spam something with a hot key at you.  When you have the language available to change in your chat window, you have reached Master level.  Learning languages takes about 15 minutes I think.  Good luck, and give the little caster one for me. : )
