First of all, yes, it is just about impossible to solo as a cleric after level 25.  That is when it becomes a must to find a regular group, but even without a regular group, it shouldn't be that hard to find a random group.  Finding a good group that you trust not to get you killed stupidly is really the problem.  I've had people pissed off with me because I wouldn't leave my group to join theirs.<p>As for gems, wizards and enchanters require the same gems for their Rune spells.  Using a peridot for anything other than a big game hunt is a waste.  And, if you're spending all of your money on gems each night, demand a cut of the loot to cover your costs.  Most clerics I know collect the loot from the kills (other than named spawns) and sell them.  After taking a split from the cost of the gems for the evening, they split with the group.  All of the groups I've ever been in are fine with this arrangement if you discuss it with them up front.  And then there are the times when Symbol is just not needed.  If your group can easily handle what you're fighting, only symbol the puller and the tanks (and possibly the enchanter, since it's likely the enchanter may get wacked when the mes breaks).<p>I've also found that most people I've grouped with would rather have a cleric than a druid or a shaman.  The reason?  Most clerics are willing to heal rather than burn.  Druids and shamans have so many other things to spend their mana on (evac, buffs, DD spells) that often when healing is needed they are oom.<p>The other thing you should do is have other people in the party help you with buffs.  If there's someone else in the party that can cast Resist/Endure spells when they're needed, have them responsible for that.  I find that I spend about 2600 mana in buffs, which is something I can't keep up with and heal without clarity especially now that buffs seem to last a shorter amount of time.  Any help is much appreciated, but thankfully I usually have an enchanter in my group and a damn good one at that.<p>Lastly, with buffs, superior heal is needed before level 40, especially with warriors.  I keep several heals up (usually just greater and superior) so that I can use what fits best based on the party members max hp and the amount of time I have to heal.<p>Just a few things that have worked for me and made my life as a cleric easier.<p>Lucretia Rialsq<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Bristlebane
