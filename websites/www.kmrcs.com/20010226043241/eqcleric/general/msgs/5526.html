I have not spent a lot of time in the Qeynos area, but my advice would be to move east and get yourself bound in RiverVale.  Granted it a long trip and full of danger, but Misty Thicket - the area outside of RiverVale has a lot of stuff around that a young cleric around your level can solo well.  There are 3 gobblin camps that you can kill to get xp and loot.  I've practically filled my bank box with large backpacks that have been dropped from gobblins.  At about 8 gold per backpack that is quite a money saver or maker (however you want to look at it).  There is also a orc camp that you can get a partner and do.  There are young kodiaks running around that are a bit higher level that can give good xp.  Also a good thing about RiverVale it's located in a pretty good area.  If you have a bit of cash you can get some decent items from people passing through the area.  West commons & east commons is fairly close.  As is runneye and the gorge.  East karanas is near, Highpass & highhold keep are both near Rivervale.  It's a pretty good point to go to and you can get to fairly good levels soloing stuff around these areas.  <p>Good luck and happy hunting to you.<p><p>: I love the class despite what anyone may say and i believe we are fairly well represented on all the servers. All the higher lv clerics have been cool towards me and it is much appreciated. Ok I don't have a lot of time to play so grouping is pretty much out of the question but where can i go around qeynos for some good xp kills in a limited amount of time. I'm lv nine and haunt the catacombs but skels give so little and the thugs and smugglers team up on me. Any suggestions would be appreciated.<p>
