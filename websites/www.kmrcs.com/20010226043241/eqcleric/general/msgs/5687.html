It is not so much that every cleric must have it.  What must be done for the quest, and what you get in return is nothing but a kick in the balls.<p>Better armor can be bought for the price that we must pay for the platinum bars.  Not to mention, you don't see the message "You have become better in stump watching (122)" ever.<p>I will personally never do the quests, same as I will probably never finish the Paw quest.  My play time is rather limited, and I would rather have fun playing with my friends, than watching a stump or killing Mitty just to get an item or two.
