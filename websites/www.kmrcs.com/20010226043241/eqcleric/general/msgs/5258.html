I feel the same.  For me its a total waste of time and not worth the hassle.  I just simply kept playing as I always do and there were alot of people in the zones running around, trying to find things, etc.<p>So far from the items I've seen they just aren't worth it.  Not to mention running around getting platinum bars, getting them enchanted, using up money from an already poor bank, etc.<p>I will say I did try the one quest in North Karana.  I spoke to Lianna he gypsy in rathe mnts and went off to North Karana and found nothing.  Apparently the guy who you kill and the body that shows up with the lute is a rare spawn.  If that doesn't turn someone off to a quest I don't know what will.<p>I had a friend doing the bard stuff yesterday and if you look at what you need for the bard stuff, at least that is fun to get some of those things because they are NOT off of rare spawns.  Camping in empty or swimming in dungeons for icons is just silly.<p>I just don't see any of these quest items replacing any of my existing things.  To be honest from what I've seen they are pretty mediocre )<p>I saw a usenet post from Brad stating he wanted to put the quest back into everquest and to remove camping.  Seems to me he didn't solve anything...<p>Ah well it was good to see when I did log in to Guk I was disappointed, the zones was still packed and overcamped.

The guantlets seemed to be fairly decent, but the boots seem to be a waste of time in my opinion.  Is it just me or what?

Perhaps someday (a month or 2) down the road I might give some thought to doing these quests or such, but I just don't feel that the items are worth all of the hassle that I've been hearing from other clerics about the wait and trying to find the NPC's and that kinda stuff.<p>: Course that's just my personal opinion.<p>
