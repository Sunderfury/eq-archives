I know a few my pieces are high end for someone of my level. The crested spaulders I got from grouping with some higher level (mid to high 30s) guildmates in the graveyard in Mistmore. The Avenging Caitliff is actually not that hard to kill. It's just getting to and staying in the Graveyard that is the tough part. The Symbol was purchased from another guildmate who is around 33rd. He did give me a break in price considering it sells for probably more than 200pp.<p>I figured the silver ruby viel is probably going to be my next upgrade (good luck I only have about 120 plat right now). I will keep the BI Brown since the AC, +5 STR and pluses on STR are more valuable right now than the WIS increase. I guess I can trade in my + STA earrings for some + WIS earrings to make up for it. Eventually I will go for either a BS Mantle or Lizzie Mantle but for now I'll stick with my crested spaulders. I do think i should make a big effort to upgrade my shield at least to the Crested M shield.<p>I guess looking at my stuff, it's not that bad for a non-twinked person (all my lower levels are mildly twinked from the excess loot from this guy no wonder I'm broke). I'm actually 26th not 25th (sad that I forgot my own level) and hopefully will soon to be 27.<p>I have one small piece of advice for clerics in the low to mid 20s. Go to Runnyeye. It is not a terribly difficult dungeon and at least on my server (Rathe) it's not terribly crowded. The BI medallion is easy to get (I have 3 in my bank and I've given away a few). The BI Crown is somewhat rare but worth the trouble and the XP is pretty damn good.<p>Good luck to everyone and thank you for the information.<p>Mithandriel Fireforge<br>26th level cleric of the Rathe<br>Brotherhood Frost
