Last night, grouped with friends -- bard, ranger, magician, wizard, enchanter -- all wanting to complete the new quests.  Meandered through several zones, and had a blast in some.  The wizard and magician both needed drops from stone skeletons in Lake Rathe, these are in southeast corner in the tower.  They were level 25, and are nasty spellcasters (magicians) who summon pets.  Two in the tower...  with a respawn rate of less than 10minutes, actually more like 5 once they were spaced out a bit.  We dropped the quests for a while and just camped them since no one else was around -- they were great exp for our mid-20's members.<p>Then we try getting some icons/ingots for me... and people are rudely defending the spot where they spawn (a particularly rude wizard in kithicor comes to mine -- basically said "this cabin is mine" to protect it for his cleric friend...  <p>So there seems to be some positives in the new quests -- the spawn rates are great for everything except cleric items.  Maybe Verant will fix this in today's patch?<p>Erondil
