It seems that the player community is reacting to the Druid petition in the same way they reacted to the cleric petition, with disdain.  Like the cleric petition, the took one step too far.  If they had left the DOT's request out the petition might have gotten more favorable response.  In a similar fashion, the request on the cleric petition for a better DD spell drew alot of fire.  Rayne, I know you were personally against adding that issue and took alot of unjustified heat for it later.<p>Like the clerics, the druids do have some justifiable issues.  I do not think they expressed them very well and they make have had to much input from players with any real knowledge of what the spells could do.<p>Snare is a awesome spell, the upgrades are somewhat lacking and should be changed to do something different.  My suggestion was a root type spell that lasted twice as long so long as the MOB took no damage.<p>Charm Animal is a really good spell and I have seen it used effectively numerous times.  This comes out of left field really and I am surprised the more experienced druids did not slap this one down fast.<p>DOTS are fine the way they are.<p>I expect the druids to get the same response we did from Verant.
