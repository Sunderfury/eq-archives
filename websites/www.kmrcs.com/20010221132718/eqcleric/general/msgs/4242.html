True they can do 1100 points of damage with the 1 spell, but it take a VERY long time for them to get all the pieces to complete the research or whatever it is to get the spell.  I have heard that people have failed like 5 or 6 times trying to make the spell.  From what I've heard one of the spell pieces comes only from Nagafen himself, and that as everybody knows is not a sunday picnic event.  So the 1100 point damage spell is well earned.<p><br>: I don't want to burst your bubble or anything, but Ice Comet does over 1100 pts of damage at level 49 for 400 mana. Which it should, it makes a wizzie a true Wizard.<p>
