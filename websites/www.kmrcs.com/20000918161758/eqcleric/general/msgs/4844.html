We leech experience do we? Hmmm ok.... then how come almost all my friends in EQ are tanks who love to have me heal them?  I'm only lvl 27, and i can walk into unrest and get a group after the first /shout.  I have lost count how many times i've saved ppl's asses, in my group and not in my group... lets see, what gets more experience, a group who's tanks die, or a group who has an extra person in it and keeps the rest of the tanks alive? Even at 27, druids and shamans can't keep up with the heals!  they can help with healing, but they will NEVER be as good as clerics.  My warrior of lvl 22 can never get a group as fast as my cleric... True we get a lot better at higher levels, but that doesn't mean we're useless at lower levels...
