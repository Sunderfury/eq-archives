I purchased mine from Starn Bearjumper.  He's the barbarian Shaman poison-spell vendor.  He sells the full line of Cures, Endures, Counteracts and Resists (for poison and disease).  Starn is located on top of some ruins in Everfrost.  The ruins are in the northernmost part of the zone, not far from the west fork of the river.  Approximate LOC is +2860, -3400.  A good map of Everfrost is available from EQAtlas.com.<p>Maaggie<br>of Xegony<p>: Greetings fellow Clerics!<br>: I have a small question: When we reach lvl 24 we get counteract poison. Ive been looking for counteract disease, but havent found it? if we dont get it it seems kinda strange to me...<p>: Adus, 24th lvl Cleric innoruuk server<p><br>
