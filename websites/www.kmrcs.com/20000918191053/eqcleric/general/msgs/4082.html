He will use these long winded post, where he basically ties together a bunch of use free associations with contradictions that he never really says anything coherent or meaningful.  I have learned not to read his posts, they are always very long, and very boring (except when needing a good laugh).

: Hi again.  I love how my arguments are &quot;attacks&quot;

: read it.  Return the decency of not resorting to

: to resort to personal attacks, insults, or name-
: calling, because it's not necessary, and frankly
: beneath all of us.  Thanks for complimenting my

: education I've pursued has been good enough to

: : (now gogrim, are you experiencing positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, or punishment? ;)

: Hmmm... if I were the jerk you think I am, I would
: reply that reading your posts is punishment.

: However, having been enlightened by you previously
: on this subject I would say it's none of the above,
: since you are neither praising me (I would never
: expect you to stoop to such a thing), nor removing
: a negative stimulus to reinforce a desired behavior.
: Since I'm too polite to say it, it can't be that
: you're punishing me... 

: I find it funny that I agree that the time limit
: was poorly implemented, and no one looks at that.
: I simply disagree in Grim's method of protest.  I
: didn't demand that he stop, or call him an asshole.
: I simply shared my opinion, as Grim shared his.
: And now *I* am being labeled as argumentative and
: that I &quot;attack&quot; people that don't share my opinion.
: If disagreeing with someone is an attack to you,
: then you lack basic social skills, and maybe
: shouldn't be judging other people.  In my
: experience, not everyone I disagree with feels
: threatened, or thinks that my difference of opinion
: should alienate me for some reason.  It's not my
: place to say, but maybe you're just a little too
: sensitive.

: Let's put an end to the hostilities... To be honest
