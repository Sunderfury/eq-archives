: I used to know Vanderben on Cazic Thule. He didn't seem too bad except for the fact that he was a shaman that never buffed - that was all I knew about him.

: Then I found out he went to the PoF and stole loot off of the hard workers who risked their lives getting it for everyone involved and lied lied lied.

: Then I found out he made other characters to do the exact same thing.

: Then I found out he put the fairest, kind hearted guild in Jeopardy because the people in it trusted him.

: Then I found out today that he, IRL, tried stealing a character he sold on Ebay. http://www.eqvault.com/ (look under Ebay Auction Warning).
