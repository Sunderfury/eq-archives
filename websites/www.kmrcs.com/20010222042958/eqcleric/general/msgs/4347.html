My best team mate is a 35 Pal while I'm 34 Clr.. I bet I'm the No 1 cleric on camping Pal items.<p>But sorry friend I'm not telling you how to do that at your level.  They don't worth your time.  At 34 you can gain 50-100pp net a night.  Buy them is much quicker plus you gain xp.  All of them is heavily camped and rare respawn.  Also it's very frustrating for newbie got ksed by high level.  Runnyeye & mistmoore will easily get trained so don't solo there.  You'll got attacked, train, zone a lot and even dying.  Technically I won't do that without SoW, invis song or puller to zone.<p>Umm is a sbh good enough to twinked boy?  Watch out for got reported since GM respawn rate is close to those items too.  :P
