Needless to say (but Im gonna say it anyway) Kill Stealers and Heal pimps suck.<br>So here is a feel good story for you:<p>I was doing Befallen with a friend. We went to try to get the BBC from the SK and found a lvl40 camped there. He was kind enough to let us camp and he even hung around to make sure we didn't get into trouble. While we waited, we took down the Thermogistricalnecrogastric-whatever her name is-the one with the Goss robe. While we did this, the SK pops and a guy runs in and grabs it. No problem. That's life. I can't complain since we were occupied. The guy gets in over his head, starts screaming for heals. Even though I'm frustrated that he gets the shot at the BBC, I dont want to see the guy die. Of course he keeps running out of range etc. and the 40 lvl gives chase to help. Well, the guy dies, and comes back yelling all bloody hell, getting in my face (he cons red to me BTW and I'm 21lvl) about how I should of healed him, and to give him the BBC (which I dont have). In the meantime, more mob action and he gets caught in middle of it, naked. Again, yelling for heals. Good nature gets the better of me and I throw him a heal to keep him alive (my party was ok-not great but I could spare one heal). Turns out the guy is A druid. A druid, pimping heals? Nice.<br>About 20 minutes later, Heal Pimping  Druid comes flying around the corner on the next SK and starts casting up a storm. KILL STOLEN. He starts laughing and doing your basic endzone dance. Claims he didnt know--right. Guess it was pretty hard to see us whacking at him.<br>The 40th level (still holding vigil) calls the guy the proper names and challenges to a duel. <br>Later I see Kill stealing, heal pimping druid DEFEAT our new friend, the lvl 40. Huh? <br>Turns out the coward druid agreed to duel outside and just before lvl 40 zones, he clicks duel, and gets the defeat broadcast. Then Kill Stealing, Heal Pimping, Coward Druid comes and boasts to us and vows to take all the rest of the SK's. Later heard this guy is a notorious KS'er etc.<br>Well I read somewhere about teaching languages (5 lines repeatedly) can screw people up (supposed to work in a group, but why you would ever do this is insane). Not supposed to work on "tells" but I set up hotkey anyway. Fight comes, I start telling the KSHPC Drud "TEACHING KILL STEALERS DWARVEN TONGUE"<br>as many times as I can. I get a "SHIT" back just before the KSHPC Druid dies. (Now, I may have had nothing to do with his death, as there were a few mobs on him...but don't burst my bubble, ok? Let a Cleric dream!!).<br>He comes back screaming bloody murder "Gonna tell all the guilds...blah blah blah harrassment blah blah blah"<br>I got a great snapshot of him looting his corpse with my buddy giving him the rude gesture in background. (I offered to email it to him).<br>Of course, duel invitations were made and waited a while and almost accepted when he was at 1/3 life from a fight-except a stupid GS attacked me...and he figured our plan and zoned.<br>The upshot to the whole night was, the SK that he KS'd did not have the BBC, but the kind lvl 40 was so happy to hear about our adventure with the moron, that he zoned back and gave us a BBC for our troubles.<p>I wish there was a a-hole listing somewhere so I could post this guy's name...for all the good people out there to beware. Nothing like trying to help someone only to have them screw you in the end.
