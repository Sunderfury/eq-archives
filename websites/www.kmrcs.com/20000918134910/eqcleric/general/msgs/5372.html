: Once you hit levels 8 (meditate) and 9 (new spells) things will start to improve.

: Another thing you might try is fighting undead.  Clerics are especially good at fighting undead.  Don't know too much about the Qeynos area.  I know there are some undead north of BB but they are way beyond your level.  Maybe there are some in West Karana?

: Sounds like you are doing good as far as armor and a weapon.

: I don't see anything obvious you are doing wrong.

: Give me a shout if you see me on FeninRo.  I am currently in Unrest so I can't be much help to you unless you want to come over to Faydark, which I would not suggest trying at your level.  If I get over towards Qeynos I will look for you.
