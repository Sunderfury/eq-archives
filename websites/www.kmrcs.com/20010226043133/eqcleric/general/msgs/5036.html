: Clerics are capable of solo'ing.

: However, it's such a boring, & lonely chore I've always opted not to.   Give me a good tank, who pulls like a maniac & a well balanced party, & I'll take this scenario over solo'ing every time.

: In my former life, (as a wizard) I was fully solo capable.  But, as I said, it's just boring & lonely.  

: Might as well make friends NOW, because sooner or later, you'll need them...   Trust me.
