: Yes. The ranger armor has the best stat bonuses of all of the classes. Each stat for each piece fits well with the ranger. The rest of the classes have just random stat bonuses with some AC. Most of the armor for the other classes is useless.<br>: I'm not trying to slight the ranger class at all.. perhaps it's just coincidence that the ranger armor has +wis +agi +dex +str bonuses and good AC. Then again perhaps not. :)<p><br>I'll tell you who plays a ranger......Brad plays a ranger.  Big suprise that the class he plays gets the best stats.  I would also like to add, that I too believe the new armor sucks.  Oh well, I'll get +wis stuff untill I can get ethereal mist.
