Much as I agree that it's Rayne's board, and he<br>can leave messages up or take them down as he sees<br>fit, I don't think the "Faggot Red Cross" posts<br>were either polite or contained worthwhile content,<br>no matter what the opinion conveyed was.  I think<br>it was a rather hateful statement that not only<br>belittles a whole class of EQ players, but somehow<br>manages to needlessly denigrate a certain segment<br>of society.  If it said "wops," "spics" or "niggers"<br>would it be any different than "faggots?"  Would<br>that make it any more or less offensive?<p>Unfortunately, there's not much we as a group, or<br>Rayne by himself, can do to control this kind of<br>crap.  Removing his posts only gives him more<br>incentive to post more, because somehow, in his<br>mind, it justifies him, and tells him that we're<br>afraid of him because he's right.  If Rayne leaves<br>it up, not only are the regular visitors to this<br>board unsettled by it, but a first-time visitor<br>might be greatly put off by seeing the word<br>"FAGGOT" boldly emblazoned across the topic list.<br>In that case, not only do they miss out on a great<br>resource for them, but we all lose out on their<br>potential contributions.<p>I don't understand the need for people like this<br>to bother our happy little community.
