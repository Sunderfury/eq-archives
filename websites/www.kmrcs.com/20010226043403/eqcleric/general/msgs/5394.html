Possible I guess, but if he is- it's not working.<p>Clerics don't level any faster or slower than any other class (okay- faster than hybrids).  If this guy is trying to say playing a cleric sucks, he's doing a pretty bad job of it.  If he's saying he doesn't know how to play EQ, he's doing a pretty good job of it.<p>To to orginial poster of the message:  I'd recoomend that you go to "http://everquest.gamestats.com" and check out the zone level chart.  Go to those zones and kill any and everything that is blue to you.  I got my cleric to level 12 in 13 hours of played time (over a two day period) without having this resource, without wandering around, without grouping (except for once), and without really knowing much about the game in general.  It's not really hard to do.<br>
