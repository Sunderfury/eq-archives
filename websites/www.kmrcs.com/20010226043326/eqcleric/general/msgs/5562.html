: Yesterday I made a new character on The Nameless server, he is a bard. I have levelled my Cleric all the way to 47, been having a great time even though clerics by all means are a weak class compared to other priest classes up until they get superior heal, when become somewhat unique.<p>: Been looking at that spellbook for as long as i can remember. To those of you who doesn't already know, having your nose in that book is your everyday life most of the time. There are ofcourse options here, you can be mana waster and use your mana in other ways, but in my experience the most effective way to use your mana is for heals and heals only (stun when needed).<p>i'm posting this more as a question than an answer, because my cleric (and my other characters) are _not_ high level, so i can't say from experience.  it would seem though that the benefit of meditating throughout the entire battle over doing other things (like getting in light taps or maybe whiffs, stunning, or maybe just watching) is the mana that is regained while you are medding.  now if you have friends who realize that you are bored out of your whits, wouldn't they maybe accept the fact that they couldn't take quite as many monsters out if it meant that you weren't going to leave?  i mean if the choice is between being inefficient and not doing it at all, don't you think you can stand a little inefficiency?  so you won't be the healingest (new word, write it down :P) cleric out there, at least you'll be the least bored of the lot :)<p><p>: I didn't have the time to camp rubicite, mostly because I hate camping. There is nothing more boring than killing the same mob over and over again to get some rare drop item from him. My equipment are made of things that have passed my way when playing, like most of the items in Nagafen's Lair where I have been alot. And now rubicite is gone as all of you know.<p>: I have spent the last days looking through all places that these quests have led me to. Also I have been looking at the stats of the pieces we are to get, and so far they have been nothing but a good laugh. The reason why they made it possible for clerics to wear armor is because we often have to take alot of mobs on us, which at higher levels can be a little hard because often we are tanking more than the tanks are and with much lesser AC and much lesser HP (for a shorter period of time yes, but sometimes we don't live that long).<p>: Where I am getting at is that we NEED high AC. And this new armor the gods (not really gods, just Verant) have given us is just a joke. I thought rubicite had too little AC to offer a cleric, so I thought maybe I should wait for Plane of Fear armor instead and get whatever kind of armor i can get my hands on below PoF.<p>: Now I hear about the spawn rates of these items we need to gather, and thinking of the stats it just makes me feel sad for all the hard working clerics out there trying to get their hands on this new armor. I hear one of these spawns are on a mob which druids camp as well (good luck there)..<p>: I took a closer look on the level 49 spells for us clerics today. And I decided that it's not worth the trouble getting there anymore. Resurrect would be fun once or twice i guess... I will roleplay my bard on this new server and try to have a good time. Clerics is a nice class, but I can't stand anymore backstabs from Verant.<p>: I wish you all good luck in the future, I am going to find a bard message board. Bye.<p>: Anonymous cleric, level 47.
