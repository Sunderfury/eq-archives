 1.  I never had any problems whatsoever grouping from levels 6-30.<p> 2.  We get good buffs and our MAIN responsibility is healing while the druids/shamans use thier mana for damage and other spells mostly. Yes, out dd does suck, it is meant to.<p> 3.  You complain becuase of the cost of the Symbol line of spells?! At the levels of 30+ money is nearly useless due to the ease with which you can attain it. What does it matter if the gems cost us? If money is that tight for you at lvl 34+ (when you get superior heal) then you are obviously not hunting anything worth killing.<p> 4.  The only places to kill at higher levels is lower Guk and Sol b? Hogwash!! Those are not even close to the only places. Those ARE just about the only places with special loot though. There is a big difference. <p> 5.  Spectres are easily soloed. There are also more than two spawn points of them. Have you ever actually gone anywhere?! What kind of misinformation are you trying to spread with your knowledge of the world of Norrath?<p> 6.  Just becuase two classes get transport spells doesn't mean we should either. Sounds like you just have spell envy to me. Teleports to holy temples?! That makes no sense considering there are only one or two main temples for each god.<p>Sounds to me like a cleric just wasn't your cup of tea. Not all classes are for all folks. Basically you hated not being able to do everything by the sounds of your complaints. Guess what? No one class can. They ALL have thier limitations. Hopefully you will have more fun playing your druid, til you run into something he cannot do and you don't like that fact. I absolutely love my cleric and plan on always playing him.
