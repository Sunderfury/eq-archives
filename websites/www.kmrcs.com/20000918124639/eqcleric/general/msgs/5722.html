: 2.) THEO THE ARDENT need help here is there anyway to make Babbinsbort spawn? does he roam? if not location of the spawn? 

: On third level of Befallen, after going through 3rd locked door, go through wooden door across from walk through wall, then go left through broken wall, then left through wooden door, then he spawns behind the fallen pillar on your left.

: I found no way of making him spawn other than waiting 7 hours. A placeholder (rat or skeleton) is there more often than he is, so expect to see him only 1 out of 4 or 5 times. Not sure what level he was but 3 wraths and he was history.

: 3.)JOVAN THE FERVENT Kill gull in oot (don't know location, once again does he roam? anyway to make him spawn? loc?)

: He roams around Aviak island just like the other roamers. I killed all the ones running around but dont know if it helped. The island is at about 1200, 3500 in ocean of tears. Take the boat from Freeport and jump off at Twin Tires where the first sirens are. Get stamina back then swim northwest to the island. Gull is about lvl 26, fights similar to Aviak harrier. Like other aviaks, no faction hit for killing these birds.

: 
: and then you need to give jovan a tumpy tonic (1 kilot nut found in oot combine with water (store bought) need skilled brewer)

: Or you can have Tumpy Irontoe make it for you in Kaladim.
