Im a level 47 cleric so I have the ability to res at with an exp gain.  With this "res enhancement" guess what, clerics how have to drop what they are doing to RUN to the persons corpse to perform the res.  Is its verants goal in life to make the cleric the most hated class because the ONE thing that makes us a cleric is we can give back life not completely useless??<p>How many times have i received a /tell (and if i go anon doesnt help people KNOW who is a high level cleric) asking me to perform a res.  Currently I say "if you drag the body to me ill charge you 20pp and 40pp if there will be traveling involved" -- I get HATE respponces about "Its you f.cking job to res people you .sshole!" and the like or the nicer "i am ashamed that a cleric would travel the path of greed than life".  WTH??  it takes 45min to perform a res and get back to where you were before they "asked" for a favor.<p>How about this for a situation : I died (it happens) and my body falls through a res error to the abyss (Lguk - it happens) I have to /petition a GM to retrieve my body, and if i GM (not apprentise, they cant teleport corpses) isnt online im screwed . . . yeah thats a "enhancement".<p>We as clerics need to take a stand, this is crap!  Look around they are taking the "best" thing about a casting class making is suck and give mose crap about its not game balance.  BS!!!!<p>Petition everyday, ask for a change to this policy, and you arent lv29+, lv39+, lv49+, hope you looking forward to being hated . . . because that is what is going to happen.<p>Right now all im here to do is get my cleric to level 50 so he will increase in value on the EBay market and get out this soon to be "Joke of a Game".  Im tired of playing a game where the goal of the programmers is to screw over everything that makes a class good or even playable.<p>Look at what they have done to the other classes, what the hell are they going to do to us next?  Take away our healing spells because they unbalance the game?  This is getting me SOOOO pissed its funny.<p>Xxyll<br>lv47 Cleric of Tunare<br>Mithaniel Marr<p>p.s. dont even get me started on this "attempt" to add dynamic quests and the such -- they are really only open to the friends of the GMs, or people that BITCH that they never have been on one, its a crock of sh.t but that a whole other rant in and of itself.
