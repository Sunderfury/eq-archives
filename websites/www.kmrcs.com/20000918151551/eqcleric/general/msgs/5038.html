I agree that we should hear positives and negatives, we often do that all on own own.  This board, correct me I'm wrong Rayne, is to give pointers, bounce ideas, fomulate strategy, and talk about being a cleric- right?  So if someone comes here and starts call me a band-aid or worse is just inflammatory, if someone feels that that is what the cleric class is- they do not know what they are talking about.  We have plenty of high level players that HAVE gone through the lower levels.  Of all the people that post here, one high level cleric has said that a druid or shaman may be of more use than a cleric at earlier levels.  One- out of maybe 20 regular posters over 44?  Hmmm.  I go to warrior boards and hear that they should have made a monk all the time.<p>You choose the class you want to play, then change if you don't like it.  It's that simple.  Why post the crap that has been posted here and be a jerk?  Guess someone gets their jollies by it- very immature in my opinion.  Will these people grow up and be immature adults?  Probably.<p>Of couse we are going to show the plus side of being a cleric, but we also show the bad side too.  We know it's a hard road we travel, I'm not lying to you or anyone else when I say there are times I wanted to quit being a cleric.  Almost everyone I know that has gotten one class to level 50 has at least one other class that they have played.  I have eight different characters spread across 3 different servers.  I hated playing a druid after I got to level 26 and just stopped playing him at 28.  Most likely was I felt a bit isolated, like most druids who kite, and I wanted to try something different.  The cleric became the perfect fit for me.<p>I've posted this already on this board, but here goes:  NO ONE has the right to tell me how to play my character, or what class I should be, in a game that I pay money for.  I'm not here for your enjoyment, or anyone else's, except mine.  If I don't do my job don't group with me, but don't pretent to tell me what my class can and can't do, what it's advantages and disadvantages are.  And don't EVER tell me that my class is a useless one, when 99% of the people that play this game know otherwise (especially me).<p>The stuff that has been posted here had nothing to do with playing a cleric, it has no place here.
