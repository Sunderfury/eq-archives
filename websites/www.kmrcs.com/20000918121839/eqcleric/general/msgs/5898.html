i've been doing my best to contact Tilrey as i haven't been able to verify if he's recovered his corpse from plane of fear yet... if he or anyone else could ask him to log on his twink and msg me/frael/serenity/ramierez/jaxartes/or anyone else from munch i'd very much appreciate it... also.. in case Tilrey doesn't know... i'm hopeful he can post his situation on our msg board... www.geocities.com/brotherhoodofmunch plz pass this info on to him if you do see him or his twink... Tilrey if you see this msg please contact me in game and/or post on the guild msg board... thx
