: Opps My apology Gogrim I placed my post in the wrong spot.  It should have been below citras. Anyhow  I am sorry, I just get sick of others that whine so much that they get asked to do reses or any other cast clarity or sow.  It is our job so lets just do it.  Of course I wont do it unless i am not busy that should be understood by all and if not to hell with them.  If ya get a donation great if not wave to the fellow and play on.  If you dont want to be bothered with the res request go anon.  (oh the other cleric was not on yet he came in awhile after I resed, just the word that I helped got to him.)  Lastly sorry to hear about your computer I hate that too.  Good luck on getting EQ running on NT and if ya could post how ya did it when ya are finished.<p>Sorry for the confusion... my workstation at work<br>is NT... computer at home is Win98.  EQ is at home<br>not work... (I *wish*).  My problem is that my work<br>computer ate its hard drive over the weekend,<br>which has made work a nightmare (lost quite a bit<br>of work, aside from having to reinstall a whole<br>bunch of software).  I'm still trying to restore<br>it back to its previous state, two days later.  I<br>haven't played EQ in a week because of a combination<br>of work and family commitments.<p>Wife:  What do you want to do for your birthday on<br>Saturday?<br>Me: Stay home and play EQ all weekend.<br>Wife:  OK.  We're going to mother's for the weekend.<br>They're having a birthday party for you.<br>Me: NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!<p>So, it's been since last Tuesday, no EQ.  I've<br>been a little on edge.<p>And now, I'll be signing on (if I even manage to<br>log on tonight) and dealing with the post-patch<br>traffic-jams.<p>Have a nice day!<p>Gorgrim<p>
