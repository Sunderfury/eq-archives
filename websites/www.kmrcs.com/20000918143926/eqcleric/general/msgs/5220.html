I got the Icon of the devout while helping a Ranger pal get Meldrath's skull. The mino attacked us while fighting Meldrath. It was a Minotaur Sentry. I dont know which piece its for but one part down 13 more to go. =P <p>PS Meldrath was significantly stonger after the patch and his Guards are a lot weaker. This area is quite deadly most of my party was mid to high 30's and we still had some deaths.<p><br>Elridge Ironstaff<br>Priest of Tuanre 33rd Level<br>Mithaniel Marr Server
