In the normal course of a major expedition where you find yourself low on mana...you would have yourself buffed up already. I mean I heal high lvl heals are quite the taunt and you can't hale yourself well uner the beats so being buffed is a priority. At lvl 19 and a half I can honestly say I NEVER adventure without atleast my armor and courage lines up.  If my symbol was better or I took more hits, or my AC was worse(twinked) i would have it up more.  The cost is worth not dying.  I have 800pp in the bank and my main character is lvl 35 and not much to spend it on. I get 3-10pp on most mobs my lvl. I remember my brother at lvl 27 had 2700pp in the bank (I never really loot kills, ex: my cleric only loots spider silk and even then PAYS the group for it). No I wasn't twinked by someone else.  No I do not practice any trade skills.  Just after lvl 30 pp is not hard to get. I mean I could buy my cleric real plate but that is about it...nothing good is for sale it is trade only.<p>But I guess back to the mana stone. from the other guys post I would say a half bub of mana for all that effort may not be worth it considering you would be meding otherwise and probably earn almost as much mana in that time.
