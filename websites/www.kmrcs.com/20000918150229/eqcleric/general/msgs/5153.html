I use it when passing though zones sometimes, particuly upper Guk. Just wave of fear all those high greens/low blues and keep running for the zone ;)<p>Saves a lot of effort, time and mana killing greens, and if you zone while there still running away you wont bring a small train to the zone line ;)<p>: If things go bad in a dungeon and your group gets jumped by way too many mobs, you can use wave of fear to make them all run away while your druid or wizard gets the evac off (if your tanks cannot tank them long enough, or you have no health to risk a final heal before evac). Usually i never keep it memmed because I simply have no room for it, I rather use a heal on the tank while evacing... But it's possible.<p>: Lito<br>: 44 Cleric<br>: Prexus server<p>
