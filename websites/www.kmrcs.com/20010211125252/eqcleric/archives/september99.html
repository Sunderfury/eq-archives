        <p>Thank you.&nbsp; You have no idea how nice it feels to see people
        coming here every day to exchange ideas on the cleric class.&nbsp; I
        feel that this site has finally established a regular audience and that
        this audience (you) deserve more than what is currently provided.&nbsp;
        Expect some upgrades in the coming weeks - a new look, a better message
        board (yea, I promised that one before, time to try again), and
        hopefully some new guides.&nbsp; I have still not decided about
        advertising, so I make no promises to keep this site advertisement free.</p>
        <p>Also, if you recently submitted a cleric guide I have not just
        blithely deleted your message; it is sitting in a buffer while I decide
        where to put them.</p>

      <blockquote>
        I ran into my first ugly camping situation last night.&nbsp; Unlike
        every prior experience I had, my party and I were the higher
        levels.&nbsp; The spawn was a rather rare spawn (1 every hour or 2), and
        drops a decent item (rare drop).&nbsp; To make a long story short, the
        lower level player (2 lower than me - I was low man in our group) was
        there first, and insisted he was staying there and taking all the spawns
        until he got the item he desired.&nbsp; He invoked the Yield Rule (we
        laughed and explained it wasn't in effect), he called us kill stealers
        (hadn't actually killed anything yet), elaborated on how long he had
        been there, etc (had a hard time feeling sorry for someone sporting a
        Paw of Opolla).&nbsp; We felt he should rotate the spawn.&nbsp; The
        situation was eventually resolved and we left with what we came to
        acquire (we traded for it), but if that's the future of the Yield Rule I
        want no part of it.&nbsp;

      <blockquote>
        <p>After reading the e-mails and message boards on this one I've come to
        the conclusion that two hours is a bit too short on the res limit and
        that four should be the absolute minimum.&nbsp; I find the corpse ridden
        zone lines as annoying as anyone, but if Verant changed the time limit
        to four it wouldn't adversely change what they were attempting to
        accomplish, but it would allow those who will have legitimate troubles
        getting to their corpse a bit more time in those cases where the corpse
        died in a <i>really bad spot</i>.&nbsp; Hey, if the spot wasn't
        dangerous there probably wouldn't be a corpse in the first place right?</p>

            of the many jobs we need to have done.&nbsp; First and foremost, We
            being Clerics and Paladins of Life, abhor all undead and those who
            call forth the undead.&nbsp; So item number one that I want is 10
            bone chips from the various decaying skeletons wandering freely
            around outside our fair town.&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, to promote
            grouping and camaraderie, find some friends and slay a putrid
            skeleton for his rib bone.&nbsp; Third, rumors abound that one of
            our own is working for Bertoxxulous.&nbsp; Find him, slay him, and
            return with proof.&nbsp; And Fourth and finally, these vile
            followers of Bertoxxulous are spreading a horrible disease around
            the Qeynos hills through the innocent animals of the area.&nbsp; We
            at the Temple value Life above all, however, this disease cannot be
            allowed to spread and cause more deaths.&nbsp; So I offer that you
            bring me 2 diseased pelts, one from a wolf and one from a bear.&nbsp;
            If you do all these things.&nbsp; I will hand over my Favorite mace

        <p>The problem as I see it is both a lack of itemization and odd item
        placement.&nbsp; Let me give an example from Permafrost.&nbsp; The
        Goblin Preacher, a level 24/25 mob, drops the Runed Circlet, +4 Wis/Int,
        AC4.&nbsp; This mob is easily taken by a balanced group in their low
        20s.&nbsp; High Priest Zaharn, a level 30 mob (give or take one) drops
        Zaharn's Coronet, +3 Str, +25 Mana, AC 5, and to acquire the item
        requires a group around 30 because the King floor spawn is much tougher
        to break.&nbsp; In my opinion the Circlet, an item easier to attain, is
        a better long term item (for a cleric) due to the fact it enhances a
        prime attribute and thus yields more mana in the long term.&nbsp;
        Furthermore, I'm not sure I will replace it.&nbsp; There are a few items
        which grant +5 Wisdom (or the equivalent), but all have less AC and may
        not be worth the trouble to acquire.&nbsp; Where is the +8 Wisdom, AC 10
        Item that 45th+ level Cleric would desire?</p>
        <p>Exacerbating the problem more are the one of a kind items such as the
        Journeyman Boots, obtained from Drelzna, a high 20s mob in Najena.&nbsp;
        I have read (unfortunately I do not have a pair) that the speed is
        somewhat less than SOW.&nbsp; Why isn't there a pair of <i>Traveler's
        Boots</i> (which grants a speed greater enough than the Journeyman's
        Boots to make them desirable) that comes from a mid 40s level mob?&nbsp;
        Before high-level players are denied access to items (the <i>yield rule</i>
        effectively does that) they should be given the opportunity to acquire
        drops from mobs appropriate to their level.</p>
        <p>Here is a potential solution:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>For every nice mid-level item there should be a desirable
            high-level replacement.&nbsp; This can be something between the
            mid-level item and items from the Plane of Fear.</li>
          <li>These items should be placed on mobs of the appropriate levels.</li>
          <li>Re-tune the Plane of Fear to make it a little more accessible to
            the high-level players.&nbsp; This also helps spread the players
            among the zones.</li>
          <li>Once the first three are done, then implement and enforce the <i>yield
            rule</i>.&nbsp; It would be fair at that point, and hopefully there
            would be much less need for it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A further suggestion is they might consider adding the new items on
        random mobs, similar to the way the Box of Abu Kar is obtained.&nbsp;
        This would have the added bonus of making <i>every</i> high level kill
        exciting.&nbsp; While I can appreciate the reasons behind fixed
        encounters, the game would benefit from an added sense of surprise.</p>
        <p>As always what do you think?&nbsp; Please post your comments on the message
        board.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The <a href="http://www.eqvault.com">EQ Vault</a> has posted a
        message by Brad McQuaid confirming that high-level camping of items is
        no longer allowed if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The mob does not yield experience; <b>and</b></li>
          <li>A lower leveled group who would get experience wishes to hunt the
            mob.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An example of this is if a group in their low 20s is hunting the
        Goblin Preacher in Permafrost a level 50 Druid (to use a real example) <b>may
        not</b> come in and kill the Preacher.&nbsp; If he does, he may be
        warned, suspended, and/or banned.&nbsp; Another example is if that same
        level 50 Druid is there (or any level that would no long gain experience
        from killing the Preacher) and a group that <b>would</b> get experience
        arrives, the first player <b>must leave</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I must admit that I have mixed feelings about this.&nbsp; My first
        thought was &quot;great, at least the high levels can't take our kills
        anymore.&quot;&nbsp; My second was, &quot;Hmm, I'm getting up there
        myself.&quot;&nbsp; My third was &quot;What if someone petitions about
        me and it isn't true?&quot;</p>
        <p>In general, I believe this is a good thing for the game.&nbsp; We've
        all read posts about high level wizards sitting invisible waiting for
        Drelzna to spawn.&nbsp; However, enforcing it properly will be difficult
        at best, and quite honestly may not be possible.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Many of the negative posts mentioned below are about the boredom of
        the heal/med/buff/med routine.&nbsp; The basic complaint is we spend a
        large amount of time not seeing the game.&nbsp; Keep in mind, <b>all</b>
        casting classes have this problem; we are not unique in this regard.</p>
        <p>So I've been trying to solve it.&nbsp; I was very proud yesterday and
        thought I had the answer.&nbsp; Since the complaint is we can't see
        while meditating, why not change that?&nbsp; Just break off the
        meditation function from the spell book.&nbsp; I even wrote it up, but
        then thought what if Verant wants us to be in danger?&nbsp; Isn't that
        the purpose of the Sentinel spell?&nbsp; Help me here.&nbsp; All casters
        spend a lot of time (more than not) looking at the same spells.&nbsp;
        I've often thought dancing girls would be nice, but that would get old
        also (not to mention some of the other issues :P).&nbsp; How can Verant
        keep us casters more engaged in the game while not affecting the
        balance?&nbsp; Please post your comments on the message board.&nbsp;</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I saw a post on the board today that really made me feel bad.&nbsp; A
        current cleric recommended this site to a friend who was interested in
        playing a cleric to learn more about the class.&nbsp; After reading the
        board the friend decided the cleric class was just awful.&nbsp; Now
        while I understand the need to vent (I too have this need as one of the
        most negative posts was by me), it shouldn't become the defining
        hallmark of our class.&nbsp; If nothing is granted in our petition, we
        still don't have it all that bad; that was recognized in the
        petition.&nbsp; I've since seen some positive posts on the board and I
        ask for more.&nbsp; Our class is by far the most in demand class of them
        all, and we need to remember this.&nbsp; I thank those who have posted
        their own positive thoughts.</p>
