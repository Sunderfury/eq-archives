Well I, as a Dwarf, can't understand what the big deal is.  Personally I would prefer to look like a dwarf, especially in plate (coffee can anyone?)<br>As for the Butcherblock Hammer (cuz i know that's what your bitching about) do you really think it would matter if it was all races?  Do you think that you would have one?  NO, There is only one per server (as of right now)!  I'm a Dwarf and I doubt i'll ever get one.  I was there at the end of the quest for the BB hammer on Innoruuk and that's probably as close as i'll ever get to it, and the same would go for you no matter what race you are.  So what else is there?  the bullsmasher?  really, it's not that great for a cleric in the first place... bloodforge armor?  it's not even as good as banded and good luck finding those damned ogres.  So stop with the grass is greener stuff, i thought that only applied to classes but apparantly i was wrong, and just enjoy your exp bonus for being a boring, common human.  I mean at least a dwarf is an INTERESTING fantasy character...  <br>my 2cp
