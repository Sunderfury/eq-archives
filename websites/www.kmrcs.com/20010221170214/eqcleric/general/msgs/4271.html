I use complete heal a lot, most mana effiecent thing out there wiht level 47-50 warriors.

When blasters in your party doesn't use the assist command<br>2. When your tanks pick the wrong MOB to take down first (ie leaving a Jin Wizard to take on that Bok Knight)<br>3. When your tanks ask, "what is the 'taunt' button is for?"<br>4. If there are 4 or more MOBs that are above 1/2 health and only 2 tanks to taunt<br>5. Both your DA/DB are recharging<br>6. You don't have Force, Root and Atone mem'd (or gate, but that won't make you a ton of friends)<p>The best time to use it is if you have an enchanter and a secondary healer.  Enchanter puts the other MOBs to sleep while the tanks do their thing, the other healer heals the enchanter when the MOBs wake up (only if you're in the process of casting Complete Heal).  Then enchanter will put the other MOBs back to sleep and that druid/shaman can toss a few DD or DOTs.<p>PS- It really freaks some higher level warriors out when you do this, as many clerics I know don't use it except after combat.  They start to get real nervous about their health when they are at 2 bubbs.  I usually tell them it's casting to make sure he doesn't get so nervous that he tries to run to the zone.

: I use complete heal a lot, most mana effiecent thing out there wiht level 47-50 warriors.  You have to judge when to use it and have to have a group that knows what it's doing to use it effectively, but I love seeing the tank go from about 1-2 bubbs of health (just over one if I timed it right) to full.

: When NOT to use it:
: 1. When blasters in your party doesn't use the assist command
: 2. When your tanks pick the wrong MOB to take down first (ie leaving a Jin Wizard to take on that Bok Knight)
: 3. When your tanks ask, &quot;what is the 'taunt' button is for?&quot;
: 4. If there are 4 or more MOBs that are above 1/2 health and only 2 tanks to taunt
: 5. Both your DA/DB are recharging
: 6. You don't have Force, Root and Atone mem'd (or gate, but that won't make you a ton of friends)

: The best time to use it is if you have an enchanter and a secondary healer.
