Clerics have a very good arsenal for dealing with duals - flash of light to blind, roots, DD's, they can heal themselves - sure it might take a bit to get going, but it's kinda hard for warriors to do much if they can't see what they are swining at or can't hit their target.<p><p>: Sure, any class can beat same level class if the guy/gal behind the screen has no clue<p>: But I have one more often then not vs clerics..<p>: Why?? here ya go....
