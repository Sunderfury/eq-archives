<br>Well with a group of almost all spellcasters it's tough because nobody wants the mob to attack them since they all have very low hp's.  What I usually do with a group in that case in root/nuke the mob and only save 2 bubbles of mana for heals at the end.  After my nuking is done I usually keep rooting the mob to keep it away from the other spellcasters.  <p>However if you had another tank to taunt the mobs away from you and the other spellcasters it probably would've went alot smoother.
