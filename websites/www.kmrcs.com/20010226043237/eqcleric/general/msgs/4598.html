Lets face it, the better the equipment, the better a cleric can do their job.  I see absolutely nothing wrong with a cleric who wants items.  Why you go and tell a cleric if they want items to go play a warrior is beyond me.  The only conclusion I can come to is you are a low level cleric where the effect of items is not as noticeable.<p>When I'm healing those level 50 tanks, those items that I shouldn't care about make all the difference in the world.<p>What kind of cleric is concerned about equipment?  A SMART cleric.  One who wants to be effective at what he does best.<p>Your spells are your power ?   Kinda, but its more the brains behind the character.  <p>At higher levels, you will need higher end equipment to be more effective.<p>: This entire topic is rediculous.. what kind of cleric is so concerned with equipment??  Your spells are your power, not your weapon.  It sounds like you should have started a warrior, not a cleric.  It's been said a thousand times already but i'll say it again.. dwarves don't get the BB hammer... ONE dwarf got the BB hammer (and it ain't me, besides it was a pally on Innoruuk)  The other hammers?  well those quests are for warriors, which is why they come from warrior guilds.  From a roleplaying standpoint it makes some sense that dwarf clerics get *decent* weapons in that they are little balls of muscle that like to bash things, this comes at a slight disadvantage of less wisdom (and i think a racial exp loss).  Besides, as Dark Elves go i've played one and i seem to recall a message that said HIGH DIFFICULTY.. if they gave Dark Elves lots of cool stuff that they could get real easy.. that doesn't sound like a difficult situation to me!  Bottom line.. stop whining about equipment or play a warrior, that's what they're there for.<p>

: Your spells are your power ?   Kinda, but its more the brains behind the character.  

: At higher levels, you will need higher end equipment to be more effective.
