The problem is not camping, the problem is that things are camped, does this make sense?<p>: Example:  Six players move into Unrest and want to get some boots from the Ghost.  There is no one else in the zone.  They camp the ghost.  The kill it a number of times and have good luck to get a pair of boots.

That is what Verant was looking to happen, the design of the game.  So what's the problem?  The problem is Group B who enters the zone and wants to camp it.

: it actually reduces the number of campers, because now you only have people camping for themselves and not to gather for others.  when you have people passing their rubicite breastplates to their level 5 characters and the level 5 characters of all their friends, you effectively have added those level 5 characters to the list of people camping the item.  i totally understood the reasoning for making PoF stuff NO DROP, since they don't want level 5 characters starting the game with the best stuff there is (that is why they made the PoF unenterable by low levels, because people were dragging their newbies in and looting stuff that a high level group killed to twink them anyway).  as for whether or not the new class-specific items should be NO DROP, i think that first they will want to make changes about how they are aquired so that evil clerics can get the items themselves.  then they should decide which is more important, the prestige of the items or the marketplace.
