This may be similar to a Shaman being able to use an Axe. They can equip it and use it but cannot train in it. Basically you will suck at hitting as it will base your chances on your Offense skill. If you can put it in your range slot that would be nice just for the bonuses. if you got one your would be better off selling it to a paladin for the cash.<p><br>: I recently saw a paladin with this weapon.  It is 2h Slash, 18 Damage 40 Delay +5 Sta +5 wis.  This is a Paladin and Cleric only weapon.
