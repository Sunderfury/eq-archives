This was a mistake, as Dark Elf AND Halfling Clerics were left off. The Dark Elf part has been fixed, they can now wear the Ethereal Mist armor, but Halflings are still left off. And as for your comment on the Temple of Solusek Ro, absolutely nothing in there is aggro to anybody and the quests will be given out to anyone regardless of race or religion, but specific to class. Please read about these things before you go making false assumptions.
