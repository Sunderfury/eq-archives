: the difference is your relative offense levels.  She gets one more point of offense<br>: so ever 4 levels she is a level better than you at fighting.<p>: this will allow her to hit more often and increase her 1hp skill to the same level as her offense.<p>: to help you a bit you could try<br>: 1) str buffs<br>: 2) dex buffs<br>: 3) atk buffs (group wolfform is only one I can think of off the top of my head)<p>: thats about it<p>
