Just note that hunting crocs & caiment you won't get any monetary value there.  The xp is really good but if you need cash that is probably not the place to hunt.  You could go to highpass hold and get a group to fight the orcs and get pretty good xp and pretty good loot.  As a continuation of this once you get to around 20-21 you can move from the pass to the keep where you can group to fight the goblins in the mines.  They give pretty good xp and pretty good loot also.  <p><p>: : I just turned 17 and I was just wondering where I should hunt. Not really sure what I can handle because I have lived in Freeport all my ife and not seen anything else. Thanks all you fellow clerics!<p>:  You can probably solo crocs in Oasis if thats your style, i think i was making about a bubble of exp per hour there right up to level 20, just rest on the first pillar, and watch out for sand giants<p>: Khalim<p>
