In Reply to: <a href="4581.html">You just compared Cleric variety against ALL casters?</a> posted by Citra on October 08, 1999 at 09:11:26:<p>
: First off most casters items are INT solely.  Nothing else..maybe AGI on the high lvl stuff.<br>: Second variety of spells? You can heal, nuke, buff, fear, stun, aoe nuke, and you can melee somewhat if need be on a green.<br>: Wizards can nuke, aoe nuke, or gate. Oh and stun. Buffs, heals, fear, lull those are not options.  Melee? not even on a low green....<p>I agree here. But I refer you to my main statement "Its not about WHO can do WHAT(like im a fighter and I cant gate), its about WHO can do WHAT in their own little world."<p>Yes, its weak argument on the caster class because they definately are limited the same way clerics are (Im not saying we're exclusive to this club), but they have so much more to choose from and think about. Look at your robes, your daggers, your books, orbs, research, etc. I totally LOVE being a cleric and yes, Ive played most other classes as well, Im just saddened by the fact that we're ignored on the variety list because we "can" use some things available to others more suited for it. <p>: Warriors, monks, rogues...lets see the variety.  Show it to me.<br>: Rangers, SK, Paladins...more variety then pure melee but still nothing to exceed a cleric.<p>OK: <br>http://everquest.gamestats.com/Classes.htm<br>http://gameznet.com/eq/class.html <br>Read all of the "Class Guides" and you'll find out one thing, every cleric guide reads the same. Not true for the others.<br>And thats only the creation and maintenance of us. Now go have a look at the weapons / armor / misc and see not only how many different ones there are available to the other classes, but how VARIED they are. <p>: Granted the other 3 casters and 2 priests may have more options. They spend the same amount of time medding. They have much less AC and worse buffs.  In return they get better nukes, pets, or something... to avoid actual combat.  They are no more powerful then a cleric. <p>Totally agree here. Its not about our usefulness or power.<p>: Ask 5 warriors what they want to fill slot 6.<p>Totally agree here. Its not about our usefulness or power still.<p>: I agree variety is nice but you didn't mention any ideas on what to add. Your comparision vs. other classes was weak (don't compare 1 class vs. 4 classes).<p>Thats the weakest point I made and you keep hammering on that alone, but still I agree with you. Ill post my ideas at the bottom.<p><p>: Have you ever tried another class to let's say lvl 20 or so? If you did you would not complain so much.  I have access to a character over 20 in almost every class except bard or wizard.<p>yes.<p>Im not complaining much at all - only said we need variety and were one of the few classes who dont have it. They add "CLR" on the list of some warrior armor and clubs and think that is sufficient.<p>: My two favorites are my cleric and enchanter.<p>Totally agree. I dont have an enchanter but I really like what they offer. Again, I never said I don't like clerics, I love them a bit too much if anything or I wouldn't spend so much time trying to add some spice to us.<p>: P.S. ever get balanced in power due to the fact you can summon a pet?
