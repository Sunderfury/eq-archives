Granter at lvl 21 I don't have that...but I get my share of beggers at a lvl 36 enc with clarity and buffs and they ever popular "can I have 100pp?".<p>When I die I drag my corpse to my camp site (As a lvl 36 enc that is a necessity) I generally leave 1 item on the corpse.  If no cleric walks up to me (I don't ask) in 2 hours or before I log I take my last item back....<p>Even last night when I knew 3 lvl 50 clerics in the zone....and was chatting with one of them for 15 mins...I never once mentioned I died and had a corpse next to me just a 5 min walk away.  Why? I think it's rude to do that.  And at lvl 36 you can be sure it was a hit. (sad thing was I died because someone said I could pick up a free evil eye bag and my invis wore off at the wrong time in my mad dash over there...actually now that I think about it in my last 5 deaths 3 of them were just incidental walking around in Lguk when invis popped).<p>Side note: Here I am scared to death to walk around guk and a lvl 14 druid friend stops in to say hello.  I busted a gut...then I remembered he is not KOS yet...I was just outside the towe on the live side of lower guk.  What I would have given to wander around there to see some peoples adventures deep inside....perhaps my cleric....someday...TIP newbie bards, druids, shaman should go here and ask to buy FS and gate back and sell them at vendors or to other newbies.  It gets so heavy we start dropping FS on the ground....and we won't give up our camp site.  Bring food/water to sell as well as be prepared to run errands.  I know one lvl 9 bard made perhaps 75-100pp off us one day....and she didn't have gate, her speed song doesn't work inside (but SoW will stay until it fades) and she couldn't go to grobb...a high CHA dark-elf enchanter could make a mint if they bound to grobb and did a bunch of one-way trips.  Especially if they have illussion wood-elf and know how to dance....we get bored down there.<br>
