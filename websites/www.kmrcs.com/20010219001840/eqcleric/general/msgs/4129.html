Shining Star of Light:  I have been diligently turning in diseased pelt after diseased pelt to raise faction with the Temple of Light (I'm and Erudite Cleric).  I am finally amiable to Waestad Wemore but he still will not give me the Cure for Lempick quest to get the Shining Star of Light. Is this quest level dependent? Or do I have to be warmly to get it? Or can I just give him the honey jum without him officially giving me the quest? Also, is there a level limit to use the Shining Star and if so what is it?<p>Screaming Mace: What level do I have to be to get the effect from this weapon? <p>Thanks for your help
