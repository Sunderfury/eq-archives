I watch people twink newbie clerics with +WIS items all the time.<p>I watched a lvl 50 twink thier cleric at lvl 10 up to like 170 wis.  I had 122 wis.  Yet I had WAY more mana WAY more AC and WAY more STR.  And you know what? I spent 5% of what she spent.<p>I kept thinking when I twinked my cleric. At lvl 1 how much mana will that be? My rings give me 40 mana, 40hp, and 8 AC.  Hers gave her 8 WIS.<p>At lvl 10 she had like 16 mana from her rings.  So I had 40 hp, 8 ac, and 24 mana over her for (on this particular item)...the same price.<p>At lvl 30 I bet it is still a better investment.  AND you know what? When I out grow those rings and  get something better for my cleric...ANY newbie character I make next will like the AC and HP and most likely the mana as well.  Even my monk would like these rings.<p>Some people just don't put thought into thier purchases.  Like me...rubicite sleeves or azure? AZURE! it is low weight and ALL ALL with the same AC.  Where is the comparision in that.  A wizard, monk, or cleric or warrior or ANYTHING newbie (sub 20) would love that.<p>My goal is to have box or ak abor filled up with stuff that weighs like 1 lb or less and has equipment suitible to get any class/race combo to lvl 25 in style. So when my cleric and enchanter are done my monk, sk, bard, ranger, etc...will just use my twinking kit until they get thier own stuff.<p>Hell when travelling with a group of friends this can be an emergency kit for when the group dies (except you) and you need to get your stuff back yet the tank is naked.
