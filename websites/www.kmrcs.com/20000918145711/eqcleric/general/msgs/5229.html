for enchanters.   Not sure if a bard's sleep song checks charisma or not, but ive read numerous posts...and a few from GZ..stating charism effects mesmerise *and* charm...AND for resist rates as well.  I can tell you from first hand experience charisma *does* effect resist rates (dropping charisma from 171 and a 10-20% mes resist rate, to 95 cha and almost a 50% resist rate in various tests while ive been bored =P).  Never even tested the durations...but Im positive both charm and mesmerise lines have a max duration, so charisma probably only effects them breaking it early...not really increasing max duration.  Tashani also helps tremendously, but thats another chapter in "enchanter 101" so Ill just save it for later =P<p>Jamal <br>35th enchanter<br>Bristlebane
