My sister-in-law just started playing, so we are playing new characters to help her level -- with the long term goal having her join us when she hits upper 20's...  Things are different now then they were a few months back... With higher level PC's in some of the "choice" leveling areas killing everything in sight to encourage the rare spawns to show up, it can be difficult to get a steady stream of blues and whites (which was how I leveled before).  Plus, a lot of powerlevels have hit 50 and are making second (third?) characters who are twinked and also trying to powerlevel -- so they help to reduce the available spawns as well...<br>Erondil<p>: I don't see what you guys are doing wrong, I got my cleric to lvl 10 the second day and lvl 14 the 3rd. You guys reall,y need to reconsider what and where you are fighting, they must not be good places. And remember, Befallen is a low lvl dungeon full of undead that we can beat on.<p>
