Well I guess but I don't think it has to do with my ISP.<p>I used to have Eartlink as my old ISP with my 56K modem and now I had RoadRunner with my Cable Modem.  Both have the the exact same problems so it seems to me it HAS to be EQ's server that's causing me all these problems.<p>I think EQ boots people off if they've been on for a while ON PURPOSE to allow other people access on to their servers.  I think they're over-crowded so they knock members off to allow other members on and call it "accidents."
