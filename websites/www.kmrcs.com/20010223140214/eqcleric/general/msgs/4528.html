: Greetings!

: I have recently proven my worthiness to the Temple of Life and now wield the Shining Star of Light (even though they called it the Shining Star of Life when awarded to me...)

: Having spent all my career prior to this defending Rivervale from orc and goblin incursions, with a few pelt-gathering trips to the West Commons thrown in, I had indifferent faction to the Rodcet Nife priests and paladins. This was not sufficient for them to charge me with the quest. Faction was, however, easy to gain by ridding the hills surrounding Qeynos of wolves and bears tainted by Bertoxxulous. Rescuing a priest captured by the Split Paw gnolls also caused them to look favorably on me.

: Once I had established amiable relations, I was entrusted with the sacred obligation that led me to the SSoL.
