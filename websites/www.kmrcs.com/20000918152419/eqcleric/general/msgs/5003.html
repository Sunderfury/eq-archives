that at level 39, ranagers can do everything a druid can except evac/taxi AND can also melee, so why would you need one in the party.. especially if you have a wizard who can outblast a druid any day of the week.  The point is, any one class can be replaced if the party is intelligent and creative.<p>If you don't enjoy the class you're playing, then play something else.  Don't come bash the class this board is dedicated to just because you're having a hard time.<p>Also, make sure you're arguments are sound.  Any party that relies on rangers and paladins to be anything more than emergency healers is foolish.  Any party that relies on a druid to be a primary healer in a level 35+ dungeon is as foolish as any party that believes a shaman can be their primary tank.<p>Lucretia Rialsq<br>Cleric of Tunare<br>Bristlebane<br>*a player who loves her cleric.. and her necro*<br>
