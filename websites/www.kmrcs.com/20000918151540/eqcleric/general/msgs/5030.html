: What do you gain by not taking a look at the pros and cons of your class.

: Many newbie clerics come here (as other classes go to other sites) and if all they ever hear are how great clerics are and never get a realistic view of their class, then they are being paid a disservice.

: Now, many posts about the negatives of the clerical class have been correct.  Have they been posted in an adult manner? No.

: However there are downsides to the class just like any of them

: It is important to share the pros as much as the cons so folks can pick what class to go with.  many do not have the time to play many different classes to find the right fit for them

: So, while some of the posts have been rude or whatever, the message is correct.

: For every plus the cleric has, another equal negative waits.. It is up to the individual player to decide what he/she likes best
