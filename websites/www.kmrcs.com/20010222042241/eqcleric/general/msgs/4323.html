: : Is there any place good to solo at this level? Preferably 
: : near the Freeport/Rivervale area.

: 
: I agree, Try So. Ro undead, and you can also try Oasis..
: I made great xp here by finding deepwater caimens
: and regular crocs.. deepwater crocs will prob 
: con red/Yellow/white to you, so I avoided these
: for the most part unless I had a tank.

: But just root and nuke with smite... can only
: take out when, then med up and find another.
: Nicest things about the crocs are they
: don't gang up on you and don't KOS.
: Bad thing is next to nothing for loot.
: You will sometimes get words of deepwater
: stuff (go figure, must be something to read
: after he finish's munching on somebody) and
: these you can sell to players for a bit of cash.

: If this gets boring, go to So Ro and do undead.
: Sometimes there is undead in Oasis too that
: works well as a change from crocs.
: Just watch out for specs/sand giants and you'll
: do fine.

: That's how I made 19 from 18 though was in Oasis,
: and pretty quickly too!

: Good luck!
