I came over the top of a sand dune and saw some person running away from a deepwater caimen (blue to me and they were 3 levels less than I).  I watched for a sec and saw that this person was getting pounded on so naturally I jumped in the fray and started beating on the croc to get it off them.  I didn't click on the other person to see what their health was, but figured I could help them to kill the croc and they would get the xp.  Well I didn't realize that this person was so low on health and a few secs later the person falls over dead, well I was kinda shocked but kept fighting the croc (The croc was about 3/4 full health when I started beating on it - so I figured the other person was still ok for health wise).  Anyway, needless to say I finished off the croc and went and sat down to heal/med.  A few minutes later I get this blasting message from the person that<br>: died saying "Why the H*LL didn't you help me? I yelled for help 4 or 5 times and you didn't help.  Why didn't you heal me?"  I replied back saying I didn't see any of your yells for help.  I had just come over the hill.  Then this person replied back and said "B*LLSH*T, I saw you standing there watching me as I got pounded.  Why didn't you even heal me?"  I (getting kinda annoyed at this person's attitude by now) replied back saying I'm not your personal healer - If you had yelled for help and I had seen it, I would have helped - I didn't see any yell message or anything - you didn't specially "say" ask for a heal or anything.  I did try to help you by beating on the croc.  This person then replied back "Well you are a cleric - look up a definition of a cleric - you are supposed to heal people"  Well at this point in time I got fed up and replied back with "I'm not your personal healer.  I will help people that are in need if they ask for help - with your attitude you are never going to get any help"  Then<br>: with that I /ignored this person.  <p>: Out of curiousity would any of you have handled this differently had you been in this situation?<p>
