Nonclerics can't camp for the armor and sell it -- it's no drop.  We're not talking ranger or bard armor here, we're talking cleric.  Cleric is NO DROP.  Period.  No selling will be happening.<p>: 2.  Other classes got armor that helps their primary purposes...

Let me repeat that:  FOUR Rangers in ONE group EACH completed the same quest in less than an hour.  They are working together and having a blast!  Clerics?

Most of us picture quests being something we can do in a group, all gain experience, and get something decent at the end.  For example:  To complete our rangers' quest, we had to hunt a brownie that was a challenge to the group -- and we got experience... Then we had to kill Meldrath and his guards -- and we all got tons of experience (since he spawns about every 5 minutes).  This was a good quest -- and we all had FUN (my god, something unheard of in this game for clerics -- please don't tell Verant).  Now contrast this with the quest to spend 6 or 7 hours staring at a stump in Kithicor... No group will enjoy this, there is NO experience to be had, no treasures, no grand adventure... just sitting and staring.  Granted, we're now staring at a stump instead of our spellbook, but the change in scenery isn't enough.<p>: All flames / responses / rebuttals welcome.

: How very right you are. When searching Cauldron for days I finally got fed up and bug'd, feedback'd and petitioned the entire thing.

: A while later a very nice guide got in contact with me and asked what the problem was. I enformed him that I had been hunting a gob named Bilge for 3 days and had yet to see him. He then told me that some one else might be killing him. That the quests were not meant to be easy and then to top it off that I should group with a ranger and have him use tracking.

: Well, Cauldron is full of rangers, thier quest items are on aquagob tidal lords, I bugged ranger after ranger with questions about Bilge tracks, they never had em tracked.

: I have a horrible feeling a high level non cleric character is timing these spawns to perfection for the belt that Bilge wears. Its gonna be a cold day in Lavastorm when I ever even see Bilge : (
