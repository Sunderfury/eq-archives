It can be very bored in a 6 people team, extremely slow XP, everyone talking while no one listening..<p>Find a warrior or hybird to team, they will love you as they can't fight good without you.  Also much faster xp for each of you if there is enough mobs.  Most important, 1 to 1 conversation is so fun.. maybe you can find your EQ husband / wife too :)<p>If you know your cleric job well enough, you can team with any other class too.  But team with a warrior is easilest.
