I was doing my usual rounds just healing and buffing people for fun and have found a very strange occurence among MANY warriors at high levels.  Every time I ask them if they want to be buffed up, they say NO!!!  They are not interested in getting 230 hp and 24 AC from a kind halfling cleric.  While some other classes do the same thing sometimes, one would think warriors would want any advantage they could get when many of them are still soloing at this level.<p>Sheesh!!!  Has anyone else noticed this strange phenomenon as well?  Does everyone at these higher levels reject free help because they think everyone is selfish and looking for something in return?<p>Boy being a nice guy is getting harder and harder every day.  Maybe I'll go to the oasis and help some people who truly deserve it!   :)<p>"Behind every great fighter there is an excellent cleric!"  -Twigg Bramblefoot
