Gatorskin Leggings are found on the anciant Croc in upper Guk. This is apparantly a very rare drop and as such is fairly expesive. Saw is auctioned for about 400pp yesterday, but as with all things this will probably vary.<p>Lizardscale Mantle is found in cazic of one of the ruby spawns (can't remember wich one). It's a fairly common drop and can normaly be picked up for 25 - 35pp. You may need to head down to the zone to pick one up though.<br>
