But that is a good team if they follow the points you outlined and avoid things like smite exp will be almost non-stop...use smite in REALLY tough fights, for runners, or when you may get KS'd (on a good loot mob).  Of course don't bother if th KS is a wiz...you don't stand a chance.<p>Now as for druid or shaman. Actually at the low lvl's you are talking about they are about equal.  At lvl 19-24 shaman's and clerics heal the same. Same with lvl 9-14 I think.  And they have SoW and better dmg nukes and melee. I do however feel cleric buffs still surpass shaman and druids at low lvls.  For example who cares about str when the str bonus doesn't happen until lvl 20? Yeah so you can carry more =)<p>It would be nice to have a druid and a cleric though since a Puller with SoW is so much better then without.....and at sub 20 outdoor zones are sweet.  A ranger sub 20 is also great to have for tracking outdoors if you are near the top of the food chain in that zone (East Karanas at 18-20 you really need a ranger with SoW to pull)
