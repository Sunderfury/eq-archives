: : Snare is one of the best spells in the game, without a doubt.  Much better than root and much more reliable when it takes hold.  Snare wasn't even nerfed in pvp unlike the overrated root.  I don't see how this spell could possibly be upgraded since it is already overpowered in my opinion.<p>: No one said that snare needed to be more powerful. They were pointing out that snare gets upgrades that dont work as well as snare. <br>: I personally think snare is quite powerful as it is. <br>: Before you start crying for it to be nerfed remember that when used as intended (runner control, groups) it benefits YOU non druids too.<p>Eh?  At what point did I ever say Snare should be nerfed?  I think in pvp it should have the same changes as root for the sake of fairness but I definitely think snare should remain the same for PVE.  But you sound like a blue server type, so I doubt pvp factors into the equation for you.<p>: : Personally I think GZ has a real thing for enchanters and guards them jealously.  <p>: I amazes me the stupid things people say about the dev team. The amount of uninformed immaturity in the online gaming world boggles the imaginaton.<p>Developers of multiplayer games are a lot like politicians...you love them or hate them based on whether they server your interests. But there is always that group rabid sycophants such as yourself who defend them to the hilt even when they do stupid things.<p>: :That's why they get the constant upgrades <p>: They get constent upgrades because they weren't finished in beta. Man of their spells were broken, resists were off. They have had power upgrades as well big nerfs (whirl anyone?).<p>Let's think this one through, shall we?  By your reasoning, Rogues would get the most attention because they are without a doubt the most incomplete class in the game.  By your reasoning, they should be getting constant upgrades and fixes.  Yet rogues don't get fixed nor do they plan to be fixed ever (Brad McQuaid's own words).  Coincidentally, none of the developers play a rogue.  Nor does the main Rogue board get daly updates from GZ.  In fact, I can't think of any class board that gets daily updates from GZ.  Enchanters are one of the best classes in the game.  Hands down the ultimate pvp'ers.  One of the most valued group members in PVE.  Yet they're getting more fixes while the rogue languishes in a woefully inadequate state (and don't mention the new Assassin armor, it's a nice gesture but hardly rectifies the situation).  So could it possibly be that GZ has a certain affinity for enchanters and takes a special interest in fine tuning them as a class?  I don't think that's a far fetched notion.<p>: :That's why I think Necros and shaman lost charm and why Charm Animal was nerfed hard.  <p>: Charm animal was never nerfed.. where did you get that from? <p>Charm animal was much more powerful in the beta from what I hear.  I could be misinformed though.<p>I am not sure why necros and shaman lost charm, I do know that it made the game a hell of a lot easier because NPC necros and shaman cant charm. <p>Ah...there we go...another carebear server type comment.  I've never played on a blue server...so when I evaluate changes to a class, they are based largely on how it would affect pvp balance.<p>I suspect they lost it because it was deemed a little unbalancing...<p>Necros having charm was ridiculous...and removing it was a good move.  Shaman having charm was not that bad of a move IF they'd replaced it with something.  But they didn't.<p>: :Personally, though, I think Druids are powerful enough without getting pet griffins to toy with even if it is only for 2 minutes.<p>: Druids are fine in general. IN fact charm is very useful in some situations. The only gripe I have is there are not more animals around to use it on :)<p>Heh...as if druids aren't powerful enough, now you want more opportunity to use charm animal?  Hunting Oasis was so easy for me it felt like an exploit.  If I'd had Oasis type zones in the 30's and 40's...I'd have made 50th in 2 or 3 weeks.<p>: <br>: : : <br>: : : : <li>They want their DoTs restored to the previous behavior and damage.</li><p>: Well they are a bunch of whiney bitches.<p>: : : Yes.  Why do you ask.  Simple.  Because the "extra tick of damage" is NOT implemented.  <p>: If this is true then it should be fixed to work as advertised. I personally dont care, my dots still do good damage.<p>: : I really wish they'd have just left things alone.  Druids being able to kite to 50th quickly really doesn't bother me.  I think they're cheating themselves actually. <p>: I agree.<p>Hooray!  I feel so validated.<p>: : Brad and GZ are just too egotistical to see their game played in a way they didn't intitially envision.  <p>: I am not sure what you expect. When you have a vision  for a game, you make your design decisions accordingly. Now whether some of their vision makes for a good game ....<p>If two rogues and a cleric make it to 50th in a couple of months because they were clever, that doesn't mean you need to make all kinds of changes.  If Jboots break root and allow warriors to finally have some parity with casters in a pvp environment, don't remove that ability from jboots.  If Druids figure out a way to get to 50th without ever grouping...big fucking deal.  Kudos to them is what I say.  Just because you designed the game with grouping in mind doesn't mean that you should get upset when people find other ways to play your game.  It's just the sign of an overblown ego and overdeveloped sense of self importance.<p><br>: :Add that to the fact that clerics get bent over in about every patch, and I pretty much think they both suck.<p>: Eh? How have clerics been bent over?<p>Well....let me count the ways.  Retribution was reduced in damage by 10%.  I'm sure you'd feel a bit angry if they did the same to starfire and ice.  Clerics were the hardest hit by far in the reduced DD damage in pvp.  Resurrection has been consistently nerfed with the various Res effects and "adjustments."  They won't fix Divine Aura because "of issues of game balance" (insert GZ and Brad are idiots here).  And the list goes on. <p>: : : 2> A Succor Affinity spell (Group emergency teleport to the Druid's bind spot)<p>: : I think this would be a nice addition too, but I think you'd get the typical moron response from GZ and Brad, "it would affect game balance."  Translation: it would make the game less tedious and we don't like that for some reason.<p>: It would definately open some the game up to some big exploits .. it would be fun figure out some good tactics for this.<p>: : : 4> A 44th level Heal Spell (call it Nature's Gift or something that gives 550hp for 300 mana. - Making it less mana efficient then superior healing, at a higher level, and gives us druids the ability to save your cleric's butt when the fit hits the shan.)<p>: All I can say about this is that clerics are required for any high level dungeon outing. I dont think this should be the case. I dont mind clerics being optimal, by a large margin, but a think the upper limits of druid and shaman healing can go up, perhaps at level 49.<br>: Two hits from the stuff I fight now = 1 of my heals, translation : cleric required.<p>Ok, Mr. Carebear...let's think this one through before we jump on the bandwagon.  What would be the PvP ramifications of giving Druids a superior healing type spell?  Imagine having the ability to nuke almost as well as a wizard, heal almost as well as a cleric and throw in ultimate speed, the ability to get anywhere in Norrath in the blink of an eye, tracking, wonderful damage shields and the ability to do some decent melee damage.  What does that translate to?  The ultimate pvp machine.  This is precisely what druids are from level 19 to 33...the ultimate pvp machines.  The only thing that makes it bearable is that their heal starts to taper out a bit in the high 30's and they become mortal again.  Now you want to give them a type of superior healing.  Very well thought out.<p>Now let's look at it from your blue server mentality.  I'm sure it would be great, yessiree, now we can take down the Avatar of Fear, Nagafen and Vox even better now.  Hooray for everyone! Group hug!  But even in this wonderful utopia of player harmony, I think it would throw things out of balance.  If Druids had a type of superior healing, why would you ever really want a cleric?  Resurrection is nice, but I think most people would be willing to forego that for a cleric that could nuke like a druid and could throw regeneration on in between fights.  What else would you like?  Mesmerize? Stun? Dual wield and double attack?  Perhap flying kick as well?<p>: With the expansion druid/shaman healing should definately go up. Also complete healing will become too powerful once tanks start reaching level 60 ..<p>Well, I'm sure clerics will be nerfed some more in the expansion.  I just can't wait.<p>: : No.  They should not get this.  Clerics don't get regeneration, druids should not get a form of superior healing.  <p>: There is a big difference in effectiveness between the two.<br>: If you want to require that a cleric be in your group then fine. Leave things as they are. I think it is kind of stupid to require a cleric in a group. <p>One of our few consolations.  We have a thankless job.<p>: :They would be ridiculously powerful.  Clerics are already pissed off enough that Skin Like Nature is better than any buff they can produce.  Very sore point =|<p>: Skin like nature is better than the level 44 cleric buf. Dont clerics get a level 49 buf?<p>Nope...no more buffs after 44th.<p>: Also so what if druids can cast a single buf which is better than a single cleric buf. Clerics can still stack their armor and symbol spells with their buf, giving them much better buffing ability.<p>Well hooray for us!  We can compete with a druid in the buff department.  But our buffs don't have a regeneration effect.<p>: Yup I like my druid too, except healing sux .. and I need a cleric! But when I have one it rocks. A cleric and druid work very well together.<p>Druids rock...you should be happy.  Try playing one in pvp and you'll be even happier.<p>: : Amen to that.  But as I explained before, GZ is a closed minded twit who seems only to be interested in improving enchanters.<p>: Bah that is unfair. Looking back at all the spell changes in each patch I see lots of different stuff.<p>It was a bit of a hyperbole but I was blowing off steam.  But GZ and Brad do seem pretty closed minded from the responses I've seen.<p>: Although I do know (from the beta boards) that verant considers many of the classes "done", so dont expect big changes.<p>Poor rogues.
