I know... And it's the same thing EVERY TIME. I don't think anyone at Verant even tried to play a Dark elf. No quests possible to do (if you roleplay) and there hey, ALL other races can become a DARK ELF just by right clicking on a mask. What do WE get to infiltrate THEIR terrotory? - NOTHING. Thanks alot...<p>/Patzy - gave up her dark elf cleric at 40 :(<p>: <br>: I was hoping that Teir'Dal have different quests than other clerics.From the information 3 of the items will be difficult to nigh impossible to get.<p>: Highpass- KOS<br>: Everfrost-Play tag with guards<br>: Kerra Isle-KOS in Qeynos and Erudin<p>: The situation is even worse for Roleplayers (EQ is supposed to be an RPG?),which is why im KOS in Highpass and qeynos.Ill Kill no xp Guards because it fits my role.<p>: Mlar D'Kath<br>: Priest of Innoruuk<br>: Hated in every Good city )<p>
