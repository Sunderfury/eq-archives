: <br>: First of all INT is the primary stat for ANY skill increase Check....Wisdom being the secondary stat once you fail the INT check...so a high INT equals faster skill maxing.  Stamina is not just for straight HP..it effects numerous other game check areas.  AC is important but to give up a stat increase for AC is to ignore the myriad of areas where stats effect in a trickle down. (bless yourself with your spells for AC/HP boost) <p>Following that line of thought, you would suggest spreading your 30 initial bonus points evenly between your stats? Seems all but the most extreme suggest a majority of points in WIS, with a few in STR and STA as well (or DEX and AGI depending on your race). Seems like we should follow those same principals as wel advance? I'm just a lowly 23rd level priestess though so I'll take the advice of those more experienced than I.<p><br>Qanimaru Willowmoon (E'ci)<br>Priestess of Tunare<br>Order of Felwithe<br>
