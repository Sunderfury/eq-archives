: **Example got to love em**
: Last night I had one of our clerics died when we were camping the basement of unrest.  He went in to pull (3 clerics and 2 necros so he was the puller) a greater dark back to our spawn spot, and up spawned 2 hags and took about 4 steps toward the us when he was stuned, shocked, blasted and smeared around.  

: We clerics can only save so much life, it takes a team to save everyone.  
: Cycle of EQ ;)
: Tanks keep mobs off everyone, Nukers make the fight shorter, enchanters control the crowd, clerics heals everyone.  
: Without a good tank the nukers would be hurting (And the clerics mana from healing).  Without nukers the fights take longer (less Mana for clerics again by healing) Without enchanters people get swamped.

: Everyone doing there job 99% of the time everyone lives.  

: Clerics are just the easist to blame.

: 30 cleric of marr

: &quot;What do you mean you couldn't heal with 2 werebats, barbed and monk on you??&quot;
