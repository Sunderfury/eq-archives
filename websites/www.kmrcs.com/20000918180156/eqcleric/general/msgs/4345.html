: able to do some twinking on people.. and it poses a problem..  if i spent the time to just level 1 person up to 40, thats literally 15 days of play time no matter what..  after we get done cuttin into dungeons with the guild, or a group effort with all the high levels..  happens allmost every other night..  not much time to twink.

: So best thing i can say is :  If your out there and want a change from prod camp servers, and the evil and arogant attitudes (might not be the case, just perspective from what happen to me when i tried playing 3 different prod servers for 2 months, no offence to anyone) Try test out.  Bug yer GMs on your server and try to work something out concerning a move, To TEST..  this is the main reason we are here, don't get me wrong, we do nothing but have fun.  But majority on test do spend an extra eye looking for any bug possible why they are out having fun.   With PoF needing new combat testing, and PoF coming out of internal inhouse testing soon, we'll need all the help from more high levels that know how to play and have the ability to get along with other players.    

: Second: If you want to move, and do not mind releveling up, by all means try test out for a week or two.  I have a feeling more high level and low level alike will find the enviroment on test server much more appealing.

: If anyone wants to get ahold of me concerning this through email, its above in the name.  If neeeded give me a name and game time and i'll try my best to talk with you in game about certain things. 

: Thanks guys.

: : Sounds like a blast- I have a question for you, but I wouldn't mind doing it- I'll ask the GMs if I can copy my character over (want to maintain same persona on my server).  I know, good luck again but worth a try.

: : My question for you is:  Wanna help power level a cleric or enchanter?

: : Full twink is nice- as it would help get through the early years, or just the services of several high level characters letting me kill the yellows and reds they help take down to nothing (mem blur or atone is a wonderful powerleveling tool).

: : If we can't get to that level quickly by getting some help, or get the character transferred over I would probably not maintain that character very long.
