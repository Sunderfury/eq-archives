: How is a DE Cleric suppose t oget around? What I know.. he is pretty much KoS everywhere he goes! That means being trapped in. How can I avoid being KoS in Rivervale, Freeport, and the other places around my hometown? Don't give me the answer go kill stuff for faction because I have no time for that. Ohh yeah.. where should I fight atlvl 10+ (wish he had a cleric guide link :o)<p>You can use the underground tunnels in Freeport to get on the boat and off the main land.<p>If you don't want to go through Rivervale, you can head south and bypass all the 'good' cities. It's<br>about 1 zone more if you are heading to PAW. Its not quick, but going through Rivervale is not much<br>easier/safer.<p>Then you could always try get people to cast Inviso on you along your way...Just kinda of risky.
