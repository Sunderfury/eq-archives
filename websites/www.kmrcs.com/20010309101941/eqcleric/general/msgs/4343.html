I just started my first cleric earlier today.  I chose Teir'Dal, because I want to have that cool-looking plate someday, and I like to RP evil characters.  I put 25 points into Strength (to 90) and the last 5 in Wisdom (which brought it to 98).  I realize that at higher levels I will most likely want higher Wisdom, but I also want to be able to wear heavy armor so I can do alittle tanking if the need arises.<p>I have played Teir'Dal before, so I knew how bad Nektulos is as far as newbie zones are.  So, first thing I do is visit the Necromancer and Thief guilds in Neriak. Why? Because I can get 2 6-slot bags for free!  With my 2 mini-backpacks I head to West Freeport. There I slaughtered as many snakes as I could for scales and fangs. When no snakes were available, I attacked Decaying Skeletons, Bats, and Rats (in that order). By the time I had reached level 3, my inventory was full. I hauled everything back to Neriak, sold everything but the snake scales, fangs, and eggs, and headed to the thieve's guild.  There is a quest there to turn in 3 scales and 3 fangs for a Dark Ebon Shield.  Although it is lore, so I could only recieve one, I noticed that I was receiving nearly 4/5ths of a bubble of experience each time!  By the time I had used up all my scales and fangs, I had earned 4 bubbles off that quest alone 8).<p>Anyway, I headed off to the Cleric guild, trained the 10 points I had saved up into 2hb (1hb is nearly maxed, and HtH is 5 or 6--I plan on trying to keep them [or at least 1hb and 2hb] maxed), and bought all of my Rank 1 spells--yes, ALL of them 8).<p>After scribing them, I headed back to West Freeport and played around awhile before camping.
