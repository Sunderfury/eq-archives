<I><br>: This entire topic is rediculous.. what kind of cleric is so concerned with equipment??  Your spells are your power, not your weapon.  It sounds like you should have started a warrior, not a cleric.  It's been said a thousand times already but i'll say it again.. dwarves don't get the BB hammer... ONE dwarf got the BB hammer (and it ain't me, besides it was a pally on Innoruuk)  The other hammers?  well those quests are for warriors, which is why they come from warrior guilds.  From a roleplaying standpoint it makes some sense that dwarf clerics get *decent* weapons in that they are little balls of muscle that like to bash things, this comes at a slight disadvantage of less wisdom (and i think a racial exp loss).  Besides, as Dark Elves go i've played one and i seem to recall a message that said HIGH DIFFICULTY.. if they gave Dark Elves lots of cool stuff that they could get real easy.. that doesn't sound like a difficult situation to me!  Bottom line.. stop whining about equipment or play a warrior, that's what they're there for.<br></I><br>i can't go in a lot of cities for fear of death (and i never get invis).  i can't ride the boat like most people, for fear of death.<br>the cleric is the class that requires the most money of any class given that they have the same number of spells, the same cost of spells, and the most expensive armor and fairly expensive weaponry...and if i want to maintain a decent standard of living, i have to run many, many zones to sell to a merchant that does more than barely tolerates my existance if he buys at all.<br>a vast number of roleplayers will not allow me in a group, because they are of an opposing race.  a vast number of evil roleplayers will harass me for grouping with other races (and the DE's that invite me to group are normally in groups composed entirely of casters in which they expect me to both tank and heal at once).  a large number of people are in my newbie zone killing the guards while spewing lines of garbage.<p>that ain't hard enough without also making much of the weaponry off limits to me?  i'm not asking to have better equipment than the rest of norrath, i'm asking for comparable equipment.  for the level 45 who insists that i am asking for a free ride since i can use all the equipment he has, all i have to add is this... the top levels of equipment in the game are necessarily designed so that all races can use them.  i am asking for their to be similar parity at lower levels.<p>-OrkinMan

: i can't go in a lot of cities for fear of death (and i never get invis).  i can't ride the boat like most people, for fear of death.
: the cleric is the class that requires the most money of any class given that they have the same number of spells, the same cost of spells, and the most expensive armor and fairly expensive weaponry...and if i want to maintain a decent standard of living, i have to run many, many zones to sell to a merchant that does more than barely tolerates my existance if he buys at all.
: a vast number of roleplayers will not allow me in a group, because they are of an opposing race.  a vast number of evil roleplayers will harass me for grouping with other races (and the DE's that invite me to group are normally in groups composed entirely of casters in which they expect me to both tank and heal at once).  a large number of people are in my newbie zone killing the guards while spewing lines of garbage.

: that ain't hard enough without also making much of the weaponry off limits to me?  i'm not asking to have better equipment than the rest of norrath, i'm asking for comparable equipment.  for the level 45 who insists that i am asking for a free ride since i can use all the equipment he has, all i have to add is this... the top levels of equipment in the game are necessarily designed so that all races can use them.  i am asking for their to be similar parity at lower levels.
