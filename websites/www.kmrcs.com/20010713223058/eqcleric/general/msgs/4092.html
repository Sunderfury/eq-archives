  <br>  Previous response mentioned the Bloodstained tunic from Unrest, while you're there you can also pick up a savants cap (+3wis +3int) which is the common drop for the Reclusive Ghoul Magi, also you may want to make a trip to Permafrost, the Goblin Preacher drops the Runed Circlet (+4int +4wis) and the Alchemist drops the mammoth hide cloak (+3 or +4wis, can't say for sure, because apparently its his RARE RARE drop, and i've killed him a dozen times, never to get one)  Lets see, you can also get a tank (lev 34+) to go with you to Sol A, charred guardian shield is pretty easy for a pair of 34+, and its +9wis.  If you don't mind completely sacrificing AC, there's also the gatorscale leggings (+4wis) dropped by the Ancient Croc is UpperGuk, he's an easy kill, you could solo him, just be prepared for a LONG camp (in 36 hours he spawned 3 times for us)  All of this stuff you could get yourself, if you put in the time, i personally won't buy anything anymore, there's not a lot of stuff i can't round up a group to go get for me nowadays.<p>Hope I helped<br>Khalim Cleric of the 35th Circle (STILL)<br>Innoruuk<br>
