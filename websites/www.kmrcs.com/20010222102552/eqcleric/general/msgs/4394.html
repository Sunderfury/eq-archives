: : Explain how you would power level a cleric?

: Easy, your talking to an enchanter (with a guild behind her as well, it's even easyer)

: Cast Clarity on Cleric
: Fetch red mob for cleric
: Debuff mob for Cleric
: Keep stunning Mob
: Finish off mob when lower than half hp

: Cleric buffs himself fully
: Cleric stands in front of it and cast/melee till dead.
: Cleric heals himself (for what little damage he/she has taken)

: med & repeat till 30+

: With a mana stone and enouther healer you could reduce the downtime.

: With tweeked equipment, you could reduce downtime and killing time.

: Fairly simple, but some skills may need a bit of work after the clerics been leveled. Also sounds fairly borring if it was going to be done seriously ;)
