I would advise not staying near the boundary. Here is why. There is an "invisible" line that the monsters do not cross. this is not at the zone, but at the bottom of the dune in front of the zone (the further side, not the zone side of the dune).<p>You do not have to run all the way to the zone to get away from monsters. As far as hunting goes, your best bet is to go near the Gypsie camp in the middle (be careful if you are not Dark Elf). I used to wander the exact middle there and would find more than enough undead wandering through. Also from that spot wander east and west toward the Derv camps.<p>As a cleric i made level 12-19 there killing undead (with the occasional trip to kill crocs at evercamp oasis). You can solo red undead (except for dry bones) there without too much of a problem when you have root and expulse at level 14. Levels 14-17 went by in 2 days of RL playing.<p>Also of note, i never personally used the northern zone. There is a high concentration of low level shamans who will give you SoW if you drop a few coins their way. I personally ran to the Innothule zone. Less chance of running blindly into something that can stun you or cast on you or Sand Giant that can chase you down.<p>Just my 2c<br>
