: Huting Priest in lower Guk last night, 4 hours a bouble of exp, a bag and a fairly reasnable braclet (5 ac, +3 wis, +15 hp - although as a rare drop of the preist it seams a bit weak), I was ready to log. The last fight (waiting for my replacment to arrive), ended up with me dying and losing that bouble of exp.<p>: To cut a long story short, betwean getting the group reorgansied, trains, clearing the way, getting more people in to help, etc. I took almost 2 hours just to get my corpse.<p>: When I did it was it was at the zone rather than the preist sport were I dided (had to petition a GM becouse my corpse was no there), and the other cleric in the party was on the other side of Guk.<p>: This spot isnt the hardest spot in the game to get to and all but myself lived.
