October 13th, 7:00am <br>-------------------- <br>We are excited to announce the implementation of the new "Optional" patch system. This new system will allow players to download new optional files such as zones, music, character animations, etc. After the EverQuest executable is run (everquest.exe), and once the download is complete, you will receive an option to patch the "optional" files. If "Yes" is selected, the optional files will begin downloading, if "No" is selected, you will bypass the optional files and continue. Please note that this optional patch requestor will appear every time everquest.exe is run. <p>In addition to the optional patch program, the following changes and enhancements have been made: <p>*Optional Patch* <p>A new zone, The Temple of Solusek Ro, is now available via the optional patch. <p>*General Enhancements* <p>- Experience and looting rights are now awarded for group aggregate damage. <br>This is now true for ALL servers. We still consider this change in 'TEST' and will conduct a poll as to whether it positively addresses the kill stealing situation in approximately 2 weeks. <br>- As mentioned on Saturday, Rubicite armor will no longer spawn. The new class specific quests to obtain the new armor are now in for each class that could wear Rubicite. <br>- Journeyman's Boots will no longer spawn where they did but rather are the products of a quest. <br>- To address trade fraud (players removing items/money immediately prior to trading to deceive the other player), items/money may only be removed by clicking on the "Cancel" button. <br>- When receiving a text message from either an NPC or PC speaking in a language other than "Common Tongue", if the user's language skill is high enough, the language being spoken will be noted preceding the text. <br>- The fishing pole will now appear in the player's hand whenever the fishing skill is used. <br>- A number of quests were both added and enhanced throughout the zones. <p>*Trade Skills* <p>A number of new items have been added to Blacksmithing. <p>*Spell Enhancements* <p>- Some of the Items that Magicians Summon with their spells have been made better / had their effects increased. <br>- Fufil's Curtailing Chant, Tuyen's Chant of Flame and Tuyen's Chant of Frost (BARD) have all had their effects slightly increased. <br>- The Burnout Series (Magicians) has had the negative HP component reduced (improvement) and the stat buff increased (improvement). Because of this, the spells are no longer permanent - they now have a 15 minute duration. Burnout III has also had its casting cost reduced. <br>- Illusion: Werewolf attack speed component now works as intended. <br>- Insipid Weakness (Enchanter) will research as intended. <p>- The EverQuest Team<br>  <br>
