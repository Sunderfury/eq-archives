: There is no sense making these quests so unattainable, when at lvl 46, clerics will end up going to fear for POF armor which is so far superior to this, and equally as <br>: difficult to get. (some would say easier as a matter of fact)<p>Haven't been to PoF lately (ever) have ya? I'm not trying to flame you, but I don't care how long we have to stare at a stump, this armor is NOT as difficult to obtain as PoF armor, not even close. I would say that PoF armor is literally 100X harder to get. Now, perhaps these quests are is more time consuming, but that's another matter ;)<p><br>
