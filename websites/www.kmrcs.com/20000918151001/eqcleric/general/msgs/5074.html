I personally pay for the stones to buff my party. In my younger days, I didn't have much money so I couldn't buy stones, but if I had stones spells were free. I believe the symbol series is for big multiparty hunts (at higher levels) and tough MoBs. At higher levels I get people offering to pay for the stones a lot though.<p>One thing for me though, I travel with a regular party and that might make a difference in some people's decisions.<p>It gets very expensive real quic though. I bought 36 Peridot at 11PP each for an excursion to the Plane of Fear (it was worth it, I got a Breastplate).<p>Tough call, but it is up to the individual player ;).<p>Caliphe<br>

: One thing for me though, I travel with a regular party and that might make a difference in some people's decisions.

: It gets very expensive real quic though. I bought 36 Peridot at 11PP each for an excursion to the Plane of Fear (it was worth it, I got a Breastplate).

: Tough call, but it is up to the individual player ;).
