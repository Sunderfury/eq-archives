It takes a certain type of individual to be a healer.  I chose the profession in order to be of service to the group.  I *like* it when that HP bar zooms back up from a next-to-nothing sliver.  I *like* it when my tanks strut around feeling cocky and make jokes about their invincibility with all my buffs up.  I *like* knowing that we'd never in a million years be able to take on these red critters without me here.<p>A "healer personality" is one who wishes to help, to befriend, to salvage, to heal.  This necessarily means "being of service."  It is a community-minded personality.  It is inclusionary rather than exclusionary.<p>When I was very young and first started reading this board, I learned that Clerics were supposed to "lead" the battles... to educate and direct the course of the battle; to decide when to pull; choose how and when to stun, fear, heal; and decide when to fight and when to flee.  This idea frightened me since I didn't feel qualified.  Of course, if you stick with your cleric into the higher levels, this role becomes natural... we do it unconsciously.  There's no other class whose sole job is to watch the battle as a whole.  *I'm* the one watching everyone's health bar.  *I'm* the one who knows what everyone else is doing... if that wiz is getting hit, I know it instantly, even before the tanks.  A healer develops a "second sight"... an instinct for the well-being of his/her party members.<p>So.. being a cleric is "being of service."

Usually, it's the tank who is watching MY health bar (which is the health bar I'm most inclined to neglect)!  I always feel the most kinship with my tanks... especially the good ones.  We both have to educate our members:  The tank says, "don't run when they hit you!  I can't taunt 'em off if you run!"  I say, "don't run when they hit you!  I can't heal when you run out of range!"  We both have to trust each other implicity... I must trust that he will taunt when the time is right and not before, and he must trust that I will heal when the time is right and not before.  He watches my health bar because he knows we're sunk if I can't heal.  I pay special attention to his health bar because I know we're sunk if he goes down.<p>More than any other relationship in the game, I believe the one between warrior and cleric is the closest.  There are other tanks and there are other healers.. but the warrior and cleric are the *exclusives* of each type.  The warrior doesn't have Mend or Feign or Lay Hands... the warrior fights extraordinarily well.  Alas, he *has* to trust his healer.  The warrior *must* take the heat.. and he must trust the cleric to be watching him.  That takes a lot of trust.

: It takes a certain type of individual to be a healer.  I chose the profession in order to be of service to the group.  I *like* it when that HP bar zooms back up from a next-to-nothing sliver.  I *like* it when my tanks strut around feeling cocky and make jokes about their invincibility with all my buffs up.  I *like* knowing that we'd never in a million years be able to take on these red critters without me here.

: A &quot;healer personality&quot; is one who wishes to help, to befriend, to salvage, to heal.  This necessarily means &quot;being of service.&quot;  It is a community-minded personality.  It is inclusionary rather than exclusionary.

: When I was very young and first started reading this board, I learned that Clerics were supposed to &quot;lead&quot; the battles... to educate and direct the course of the battle; to decide when to pull; choose how and when to stun, fear, heal; and decide when to fight and when to flee.  This idea frightened me since I didn't feel qualified.  Of course, if you stick with your cleric into the higher levels, this role becomes natural... we do it unconsciously.  There's no other class whose sole job is to watch the battle as a whole.  *I'm* the one watching everyone's health bar.  *I'm* the one who knows what everyone else is doing... if that wiz is getting hit, I know it instantly, even before the tanks.  A healer develops a &quot;second sight&quot;... an instinct for the well-being of his/her party members.

: So.. being a cleric is &quot;being of service.&quot;  Why then does this Warrior, Torax, twist that into &quot;being a servant&quot;?

: A good warrior is vital to a group.  God, I love a good tank!  Usually, it's the tank who is watching MY health bar (which is the health bar I'm most inclined to neglect)!  I always feel the most kinship with my tanks... especially the good ones.  We both have to educate our members:  The tank says, &quot;don't run when they hit you!  I can't taunt 'em off if you run!&quot;  I say, &quot;don't run when they hit you!  I can't heal when you run out of range!&quot;  We both have to trust each other implicity... I must trust that he will taunt when the time is right and not before, and he must trust that I will heal when the time is right and not before.  He watches my health bar because he knows we're sunk if I can't heal.  I pay special attention to his health bar because I know we're sunk if he goes down.
