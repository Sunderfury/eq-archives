: I once got attacked by a druid who was red to me on Rallos Zek...he was naked of course and after using grasping roots or whatever that spell is that slows you down, he started filling me with lightning bolts.

: So I just sat there watching my health drop and healed myself at the right times.

: He finally ran out of mana and came over and started punching me (of course he had no weapon since he didn't want to lose it).  The fight ended shortly after that...my mace along with my party who had finally caught up finished him off quick.

: When he ran out of mana from blasting, I still had about half my mana left from the healing.

: Suffice to say, clerics are extremely tough to take down one on one.  All you have to do is resist panicking and trying to use offensive magic.  You cannot compete that way.

: He did message me afterwards with a line like 'Damn, hate clerics!' and I laughed in his face. 8)
