: I just want to echo something that other people mentioned (and I hope you don't mind some basics)...

: When you see a monster, do you target it and type 'c'?  This will 'consider' it.  Considering it will give you a message that will evaluate the relative difficulty of killing it.  The color of the message is the important part at your level.

: Green - not worth fighting, it won't give you any experience (XP).
: Blue - make sure it has no friends around, and KILL IT!
: White/Black - only try fighting it if the guards are near
: Yellow - Don't try unless you are grouped
: Red - run away.

: At your level, I believe you should be able to get a &quot;bubble&quot; of XP by killing about 6-8 blues.  With 5 bubbles in a level, I'd say you can reasonably expect to get a bubble each night you play, and get a level every week or so.  It does get harder as you go up, though.

: Are you wasting time killing greens?
: I recommend you kill the giant rats in Qeynos Hills at level 6.
: You may want to try hunting near the guard towers in West Karana at level 7 or 8.
: Black Burrow is good, but be careful - easy to die in there at lower levels.

: Good Luck
