But I have very few agility boosting items if any at all. Didnt put any points in to it at start up either.

So i got much better ac from my BE chest.<br>: That +9 agil you got from the bracer must have put you over some major threshold<br>: because this is the first time ive every heard of +9 agil granting 40 AC. Can you give me some more information?<br>: Whats your agil and AC before and after putting on the bracer?<p>
