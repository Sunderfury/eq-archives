: They tell you there are new quests - something I honestly feel will eventually work... just not the SAME WAY they've BEEN doing it.

: 1. Here are all the zones one must visit to complete the quests: Kithcor, Lake Rathetear, Befallen, Everfrost Peaks, OOT, HHP, Upper Guk, Kerra Ridge, Runnyeye, Dagnors Cauldron, Meldrath mines. (this is BEFORE you get re-directed (diary, Lianna, etc)).

: This, in itself, is enough to keep most on-the-ball-high-level clerics WITH a druid busy for a several weeks or more (even if the re-spawn was within 5 minutes). We dont need to wait 6 - 9 HOURS PER Ingot or Icon or Spawn or whatever. It's simply a time waster and I think that was EXACTLY what they had in mind - waste an exorbanant amount of time questing in hopes that common camping points got some relief. 
: If this was not their intention and they simply wanted to make more quests for us, then they need to pay attention; the biggest complaint from EVERYONE all the time is the ridiculous spawn times and worthless waiting around. I'd rather clean my refridgerator than sit online for 6 hours (possible getting disconnected or having someone else nab the spawn) waiting for a quest item that may or may not be worth it. Not to mention it may be broken and ALWAYS non-refundable by the guides if it is so.

: My solution:

: 1. Make quest items some of the best items in the game and make them time-efficient so they become FUN and worthwhile. Thats all we want - fun. Fun. Fun. Not boring or irritating to a fault.
: Then even if they are nerfed or take forever, we MAY forgive and continue to quest.

: 2. EMPOWER GM's. If somone reports a problem in a petition, assume they are telling the truth and do what you can as opposed to the standard of doing as little as possible. 
: If you need to, make a &quot;check&quot; next to every petition so you know how many petitions a person has had in their EQ life to better determine the few who will &quot;Get one over on you&quot;.
