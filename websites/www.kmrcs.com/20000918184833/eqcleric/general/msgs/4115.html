: After playing my DE cleric to his 29th season I must say I wholeheartedly agree with you on this...the DE cleric seems to have been forgotten about questwise.  Now the Butcherblock hammer comes out, gnome and dwarf only...isn't that lovely.  <p>But it's not even small races only - I can't wield it! I really can't understand why it would be wieldable by dwarves and gnomes but not halflings, what's that all about? Gotta be a typo...<p>Zakalwe Soulwarden<br>Halfling Cleric @ Povar.<br>
