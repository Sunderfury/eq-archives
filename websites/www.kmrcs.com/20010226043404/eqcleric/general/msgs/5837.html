If you haven't tried the gobblins in the keep you might want to try that.  I had a fantastic weekend in the keep.  I was grouped with a group of higher levels than I (lot higher, majority were 6-8 levels above me) but I was welcomed due to my healing prowess.  I think I made about 30-35 plat this weekend and made 1 2/3 level.  I started Friday night with about 1/2 toward 25 and ended last night with about 1/4 of a bubble left to finish til i'm 26.  All in all it was a good weekend.  I haven't tried to kill treants yet as all the groups I've been with had either a druid or a ranger in them and didn't want to mess up their faction.<br> <p><br>: I'm planning on returning to S.

But if you have a group that is mainly comprised of spell casters, you are going to have a tough time anywhere you go.  You need to have a body that you can stand in front and absorb the damage.
