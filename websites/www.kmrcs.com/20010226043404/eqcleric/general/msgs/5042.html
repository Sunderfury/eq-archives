What I said is that it is not impossible or as difficult as many make it out to be to solo. Every time someone on this board mentions a cleric soloing, there are at least 3 responses to the effect of "Don't even try to solo - you can't".<p>I do group most of the time. I am rarely without at least my warrior partner. But, I can still solo just fine when I choose to. Believe it or not, there are people who enjoy soloing even though they understand it's not as efficient as grouping - I get in that mood every now and then myself (especially after a long stint with some of the idiots who frequent Unrest). These people come to this board looking for help and are instead told that they shouldn't even try it - IMO that's simply not true, it is easily possible to solo and do decently at it.<p>
