  Well, got my first *real* taste of mobs going nuts on the healer last night in Lower Guk (Live Side, greater minos and the patriarch, throw in a handful of frogs and you get the idea)  The group was made up of a ranger, warrior, 2 wiz, magician and myself cleric, all levels 35-40)  Anyways, anytime the puller got more than 2, MAYBE 3 mobs, i died, repeatedly, every time i threw a heal, i got frenzied on and died, rest of group lived, but i died, now the exp down here was great, and I ended up breaking even, not to mention getting azure sleeves to trade away..  Anyways, i've spent most of my time outdoors, or in dungeons before, but previous to level 35, i never had this problem, i could even tank a little when needed, now i get wasted in about 30 seconds.  Is the factor of tanks=mobs reasonable? Ie, if 2 tanks pull 4 in this group makeup, are we always going to die?  You'd think 4 blue cons for a 6 person group wouldn't be this hard?  I tried using invulnerability once, it got the stuff off me temporarily, but as soon as i threw one heal, they were on me again, even with taunt it took a bit for a tank to pull one off, never mind each tank having to pull 2 off me, which usually got them down to half health, and in need of a heal.  Sure, Atone would be nice, but with 4 mobs beating you for 80+ damage twice a round, can't really get spells off at all.  Is the group makeup at 35+ now going to have to change completely?  I've always grouped with wizards and druids, but the frenzy thing didn't happen at previous levels.  Any suggestions?  Do groups now need to be made up of all tanks, one or two healers, and ONE wiz?  It would seem to me if the number of tanks equalled the number of monsters, we'd be ok, one on one for a tank is pretty easy, and easier to pull off me or the wiz.  Any suggestions?  I know a lot of you have run into this problem, and i'd rather get some expert advice than learn by trial and error (esp while i'm in a hell level)<p>Thanks<br>Khalim<br>Cleric of the 35th Circle<br>Innoruuk<br>
