I am a level 30 Tier'Dal cleric on the Rallos Zek server and from my perspective, most of these really cool items such as the BB Hammer/Maul are a waste of time.  Frankly, most of us won't get one and after seeing one of these GM events and watching GM's kill and loot PC's, I'm more inclined to avoid the darn things.  So why get in a fuss over whether we can use them or not?  I don't wear plate, except for the gloves, and rarely worry about AC.  If you want good stuff for clerics, just hunt down the nearest druid page and steal the stuff they all want.  Like I say, I'm level 30 and wearing solid leather.  Albeit, magic leather. :)  Do you expect to be able to loot Vox out of the 50 people it took to kill her?  And on RZ, do you expect to live long enough to get out of the dungeon with it?  From what I've seen, we're just like wizards.  Mana is everything, from soloing, if we're being beaten on, we're going to die anyway, to grouping we're either blasting or healing and mana is the way to go, go get out your notepad and start checking out those 'gater pants and Foreman tunics.  Plus, it weighs half as much, so for a change, I can tote a few FS weapons home and not have to blow the boogie boots just to look like I'm moving normally.
