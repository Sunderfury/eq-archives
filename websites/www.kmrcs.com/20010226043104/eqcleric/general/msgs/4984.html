Well then, since the main topic of your post seems to be that it's hard for you to play a class where everything you do depends upon soloing.  What class can you play that can effectively solo?  Any?  Not very likely.  Even druid have a hard time soloing.  Sure they can DOT and kite & stuff like that, but it takes a heck of a long time to kite something to get decent xp.  Warriors can probably solo mobs but then they sit forever (I have a 16th level warrior so I know about sitting around).  The game is designed around grouping and sure it gets tough at times, but I personally haven't found that much of a trouble getting groups.  I am currently level 24 and I don't notice that people seem to think that druids or shamans heal any better than I do.  As a matter of fact I am always getting compliments on how well I heal and how it's refreshing to see that I take pride in my chosen profession.  If you don't like the class, my recommendation would be don't play it.<p><p>: Firstly I'd like to say I started as a wizard and later started a cleric which became my primary character.  Well even before I write this I'm going to say I pretty much have begun to HATE my cleric.  <p>: Everyone has been telling me, it gets better just hang in there.  Well I've hung in there for months and in fact its gotten worse.<p>: Well when I started this character, grouping off the bat was next to impossible.    <p>: Lets be honest about it, low level clerics absolutely suck.  Your abilties are basically matched with those of Shamans and Druids at what clerics are suppose to be the best at:  Healing.  This is one of my primary problems with the class I chose.  Other classes are also "masters" at what your class is devoted to at lower levels.  I think thats a BIG problem.  People have said, well it enhances the group.  Sure it enhances the group, at the compromise of a clerics main ability.  The jist of it is that it cheapens clerics at the one thing they are suppose to be good at.  I don't remember seeing clerics match anyone else at their abilities at the lower levels.<p>: Honestly, at low levels who would you rather have in your group if you could have only one of these characters; a cleric, a shaman or a druid ?  I could almost guarantee you that it would be a shaman or druid; a more useful utility type player at those levels.<p>: I use to travel and hour to 2 hours a night trying to find a group at lower levels, and less face it you will need to group at lower levels.  Most of the lower end levels ended up soloing.  Soloing as a cleric is near next to impossible.  We are definately not matched with any class at lower levels on things such as DD (Heck we do 80 damage DD until 29).<p>: I did find a steady group for about 5 levels, consisting of a monk, druid, shaman, warrior and myself being the cleric.<p>: During this time I was matched in my prime abilities.  The Druids buffs would overlap mine, and the shaman/druid matched me with greater healing.<p>: Well eventually I became better and worked hard on my character.  I received my Superior healing spell.  I thought that finally things would change now that my healing abilities are unique.  That just wasn't the case, superior healing is useful but only after level 40.  (This is why everyone is under the impression that clerics shine at 40+).  Another thing that miffed me about clerics is that we have to spend huge costs on buffs that require gems.  Why is this ?  Are we not poor enough already?  The Pinzarn symbol costs anywhere from 8go to 1pp per cast, and Naltron symbol I believe costs 9pp to 11pp per cast.  Well we are suppose to be good at buffing, but if we want to do it we have to pay through the nose.  Why couldn't they do this the same way many druid spells work?  For instance, if you want to use the flame lick spell (A level 1 druid spell) you simply have to have a fire beetle eye in your inventory and it never goes away and you can cast that spell an unlimited amount of time as long as you have the fire beetle eye in your inventory.  Why can't clerics simply have an infinte gem per each symbol that doesn't go away?  If you want to be a cleric who can buff, you are going to have to pay through the nose.  I myself can't even upgrade my jewelry because I can't even afford it because of the buffing  --and yes buffing is important.  Apparently we are supposed to have the best buffs in the game, but if we want to be the best we have to pay for it.<p>: ...Well you are high level now...you say to yourself, great, everyone needs a cleric!<p>: The reality is you will find it even HARDER to group at higher levels than at the lower ones.  There are essentially 2 places you can play at higher levels.  Guk and SolB.  That is where all the high level clerics are, and they are always in surplus.  I spent days in lower guk trying to group up for about 2-3 hours a day and not once finding a group but always getting res resquests.<p>: If you can't find a group you are basically out to lunch.  Unlike many other classes that can solo when they can't group, you can't solo things blue to you at higher levels such as HGs.  You can consider doing spectres at higher levels but consider you will be training them when trying to solo you might as well forget that, not to mention 2 tiny spawn points for each server isn't going to cut it.<p>: The conclusion I've came to is, grouping dominates whether you play or not (this is moreso true for a cleric than any other class).  If you are lucky enough to get into a group, you can play.  If you can't group theres not much you can do other than buff and res people.  Doing this for a week I wouldn't consider fun at all.<p>: Travelling in this game in general is also somewhat ridiculous especially considering clerics have to travel alot especially with the ressurection changes.  I ressed 3 people yesterday from a corpse recovery.  Only one of them was able to be ressurected with xp because of the time it took to travel, to locate bodies and get them to a safe point.  This 2 hr time limit is a slap in the face of one of the prime abilities we have  --I'm disappointed in verant going through with this change.<p>: With regards to travelling, Why don't clerics get teleportation abilities to holy temples ?  Ridiculous.  Druids are casters/priests and they receive teleportation to their druid rings, wizards get teleport to teleportationg circles, but clerics don't get any sort of teleport?<p>: Well what can I say folks, I really thought the cleric class would be fun and worthwhile.  I checked my playtime yesterday on my cleric and it was just under 40 days (can you believe that).  <p>: What can I say, this may sound strange but even if I deleted him I probably wouldn't miss him one bit.  Maybe if there were some adjustments to our class it would be more enjoyable but at this point its not; it seems like more tedium than anything else.

True at higher levels you get new spells that are suppose to make you shine as a cleric, but being a high level.<p>: What can I say, I guess you just have to experience it and by then its too late =)<p>
