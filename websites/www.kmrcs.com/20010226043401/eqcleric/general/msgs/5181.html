: Theres really only 1 way to buy plate mail.
: Create a charisma twinked mule.
: I had a friend just make one, I gave him the cash and he bought it for me.
: We created a paladin in freeport and maxed his charisma.
: I had a few +charisma items and he put them on and checked the prices, but the +charisma items didn't make any difference at all.
: I assume this means that there is a maximum charisma that makes a difference.
: The merchant conned indiffernt to the mule and amiable to me but the mule still could buy it cheaper.

: Anyway, the only piece I purchased was the leggings so far and I paid 420 plat for them.
: I believe the breast plate was like 850 or so.
: I would not recommend buying the non-visible items as these spots should of course be used for +wis items.

: Hope no one flames me for &quot;cheating&quot;, but as broke as I am, I have to cut every corner I can, which means not throwing money away to NPCs. :)
