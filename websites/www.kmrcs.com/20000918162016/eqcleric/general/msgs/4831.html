I grouped w/ a lvl 50 magician and some other low levels (my friends) and we took out Ogrefiend in the Rathe Mtns.  The lvl 50 acknowledged that he couldn't solo him.<p>Lvl 50 magician and his pet did the main damage...a lvl 31 mage friends pet did maybe 300pts of dmg, the lvl 30 Ranger did 76 pts w/ his bow.  I healed the pet for over 2500hps which made the difference when Ogrefiend was hitting him for 270pts per attack round.  Oh yeah, worthless class.  It was pretty much agreed that the Lvl 50 magician and his pet, with just me adding a couple thousand extra HP could have done the deed.  But without my wimpy little lvl 34 butt...Ogrefiend would still be alive!
