I completed the Shining Star of Life Quest 4 times without being attacked.  I was doing the Quest and selling the staff for about 25P.  Well I decided to run the Quests again after about a week and wham!! I am attacked the first two times I ran the Quest.  On the 2nd attack I actually killed him thinking that I could loot the item.  (I killed him but there was not item)  Well by this point I am worried because I love the Shining Star of Light as my personal weapon of choice.  Well I ran the Quest a third time and Got the Staff.  I feel much better and have decided not to run the Quest again.   I got tired of running around Rivervale begging newbies for Hoeny Combs so that I could quickly get back to Qeynos  ;)<br>
