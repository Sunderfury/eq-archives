: just to make those things spawn more frequently would be the best/easiest fix
: Ive seen the rods for Staff of the Wheel (wiz only) they spawn 2-3 mins after you get it
: so they are just about always laying there for some wizard to come get.

: I mean hell... if you make ranger only runes spawn every 8-10 mins on Redwind
: and the rods for wizards ever 2-3 mins WHY not put everyone on the
: same standard.. Bard only stuff pops left and right in lower guk.

: What really irks me is how everyone quest has totally different guidelines.

: Really? Who here HASNT got a few of the warrior ONLY crafted items that you need.
: not hard at all.. blah

: a big ARGGG to these new quests so far..
