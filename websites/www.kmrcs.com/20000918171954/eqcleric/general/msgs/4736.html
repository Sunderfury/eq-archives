In Reply to: <a href="4559.html">Something kinda like that happened to a friend of mine</a> posted by Dalur - Veeshan on October 08, 1999 at 07:33:27:<p>
: Not sure exactly where he was fighting (he's on a different server than I) - he was with his group going somewhere and he took a bad step and fell about 25-30 feet and took like 6000 points of non melee damage (level 37 ranger) and died.  The spot that he fell in would have been almost impossible to get to via normal means.  They didn't have anybody in their group that could levitate or such so my friend petitioned a GM and explained the situation that he thought it kinda bogus that he had fallen about 25-30 feet and taken 6000 points of damage and that he wanted to know if the GM could move his corpse so he could retrieve it and such.  Well the GM said he couldn't find any problem with what had happended and that he couldn't move the corpse for him.  So my friend was going to head back and see if they could find a different route to get back to his corpse - as he entered the zone area he noticed a corpse partial buried in the wall near the zone and went over to see who's it was and found it was his corpse.  The funny thing he said was that they were a long ways into the zone line and he couldn't figure out how his corpse had gotten to the front of the zone especially since the GM had said he wouldn't move the corpse.<p><br>i was a bard in beta and as a result had many, many experiences of finding people's bodies in places other than where they say they died, finding their body but they can't see it and having to loot it and give them their stuff back, and not being able to locate the body at all but they find it later and loot it.<p>-OrkinMan

: i was a bard in beta and as a result had many, many experiences of finding people's bodies in places other than where they say they died, finding their body but they can't see it and having to loot it and give them their stuff back, and not being able to locate the body at all but they find it later and loot it.
