I primarily solo'd my younger levels.  Why?  Well, I've played a few characters into thier 20s, & just wanted to get past the newbie phase as quickly as possible.   Plus, at 6th level, you don't even have meditate yet.  This reduces your effectiveness greatly.  <p>Just hang in there, & keep working at it.  At 8th, you'll be like a whole new character.  9th you get new spells.  It's where you actually get the 1st taste of what being a cleric is about. <p>Tomma Trueheart<br>Priestess of Mithaniel Marr, 24L<br>Kel'Daoine
