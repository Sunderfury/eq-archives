I am a Level Six Cleric out of Qeynos playing on the Fennin Ro server.  I have been working hard on this character for months now (I don't get a lot of time to play which accounts for the low level of my character) and I've found the Cleric to best suit my tastes.  I enjoy being able to fight (and I do fight well for my level--everything on top of BB is entirely green to me and far too easy of a kill) and cast magic and heal others, which I do every chance I get.<p>My problem is I primarily solo.  I realize Clerics CAN solo, however what one CAN do and what one SHOULD do are two very different things.  I've tried grouping on numerous occasions and everytime my group (which is a group in the loosest sense of the word) ends up going their own way when we reach out destination and we lose each other within a minute or less.  We tend to spend the majority of time trying to FIND eachother rather than fighting which is NOT the reason I grouped in the first place.  Not on single group I have ever joined has ever been able to work as a team--in fact the only time they've even acknowledged my being there is--naturally--for me to cure them of poison, rabies or heal their wounds.<p>Can anyone PLEASE help me?  I want to gain experience and get to higher levels and soloing has worked somewhat but I also want to work as a team with people.  After all, if I really want to just work alone, I didn't need to go out and buy an ONLINE game, did I?  :)
