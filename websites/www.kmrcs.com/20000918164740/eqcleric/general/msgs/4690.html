I love druids in my party.  Part of the problem at that level is that druids often find (pre-patch) that they could gain more experience going solo on the Karanas than by grouping.  Sure, some of your spells are outdoor only, but that isn't a big decrease in your power to a group.  The thing is that not many people KNOW how to use a druid in a group at that level, and most of the druids don't know where they fit into a group because they have been soloing so much.  For clerics, it the exact opposite.  We've been forced to group since mid- to late-teens.  We've been able to show how valuable we are in a group.<p>I agree with the number and variety of the spells the druids get, it's very impressive and a lot of fun (wolf form and wolf pack are great! as well as regen and pack regen- VERY nice stuff).  I do think enchanters get more spells and have a greater variety, but not by much.<p>Just my 2 coppers, as I've played a both classes (druid to 28, cleric to 44).
