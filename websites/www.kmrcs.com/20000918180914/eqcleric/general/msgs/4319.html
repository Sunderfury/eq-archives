Yep, nuking is a lot more fun, without question.  Smart?  In groups, no.  Solo, yes, for both my ranger and cleric.  As pitiful as my ranger's nuking ability is, not only in comparision to "real" nukers, but even to her own melee ability, she nevertheless relies heavily on Ignite when soloing.  So quite definitely my cleric nukes a lot when she solos, with her much higher nuking ability and much lower melee capabilities.<p>In groups, sure, my cleric uses root or smite to stop runners.  I won't use root at all if there's a ranger in the group - ensnare is so much better (when mobs are ready to run, they won't fight back if ensnared). Stun, too, but mostly on spellcasters.  I'll also use it more heavily when paired with a non-tank. Buffs? Of course.  But none of that meet my definition of nuking, other than stopping a runner with smite.<p>I'll occasionally nuke in groups for general fun, of course, but I won't take the risk of not having the mana for a heal if it might be needed.  Nor add to the down time by burning too much mana unnecessarily. I do it so rarely though, that I sometimes get the feeling that the tanks are turning around and looking at me puzzled after I smite a runner, as if unsure where the blast came from. :))  Just fancy on my part, I suppose. ;))<p>My ranger's lack of tolerance for healers who consider themselves nukers?  That's an easy one - she's died too many times because of it.  It's usually not a cleric, who as a class, seem to understand that their primary job is healing.  Shamans as well. Although the vast majority of druids are good as healers, there are a few, who seem convinced that they can best help by blasting.  Which is a bit annoying - just as clerics are courted by tanks to join groups, tanks are courted by the "real" nukers.  If I wanted another nuker in the group, I usually don't have a hard time getting one.  But my preference is for a healer.  So of course, I get a bit annoyed when I find out they think they're a nuker ;))<p>Yeah, I can't quite get the hang of Calm, either :))  My ranger has problems getting Harmony to work as well, so I guess it's something I'm doing wrong.  LOL about the sight of dwarves negating the calming effects - maybe that's my female wood elf's problem, too.  ;))<p><p><p><p>
