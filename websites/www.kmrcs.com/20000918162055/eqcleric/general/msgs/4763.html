Well that is where you are wrong I have played the cleric class and know from experience I got my cleric to lvl 34 and like I have said res is the only good thing the cleric class has I have played basically all the classes and races so far and honestly the cleric was the biggest waste of time if you like the class fine but you must live a boring life yes a boring life and must feel useless with no purpose in the world of Norath other than leaching off of other peoples experience. Someday you too will realize the hours on end you have wasted with this char basically you will strip him and start a new twinkie . To this you may not admit publicly but will to your self that Blackeye was right and you where wrong face the facts you a just a leach stuck on a partys back in the world of everquest.<p><br>Blackeye   Fennin Ro<p>The day will come when the all clerics will discover that they have wasted 100s of hours building a waste of time.<p>: Some people just have no clue, here's a great example of stupidity.<p>: I've tried the majority of the classes out there, bet he hasn't.<p>
