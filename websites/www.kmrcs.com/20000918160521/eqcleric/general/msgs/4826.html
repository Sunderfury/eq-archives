They arent.<p>They do tend to have a bit more strength and offten use a two handed weapon rather than one handed, which means they tend to do a bit more damage when they do hit. They also will generaly have more hp due to there high stamina.

Obviously an ogre is better at melee than a high elf, but race issues aside, shamen are no more viable in melee than clerics are.<p>:  We wear better armor than they do, and our HP and AC buffs offset their ability buffs to a great degree.
