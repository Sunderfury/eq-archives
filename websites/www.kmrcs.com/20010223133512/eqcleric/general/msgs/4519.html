<I><br>: This was a mistake, as Dark Elf AND Halfling Clerics were left off. The Dark Elf part has been fixed, they can now wear the Ethereal Mist armor, but Halflings are still left off. And as for your comment on the Temple of Solusek Ro, absolutely nothing in there is aggro to anybody and the quests will be given out to anyone regardless of race or religion, but specific to class. Please read about these things before you go making false assumptions.<br></I><br>the comment was that the items that have to be gathered to complete the quest (which are NO DROP) are in places like HighHold Keep where they cannot go to.  it's one thing to be able to get the quest, it's another to be able to do it.<p>-OrkinMan
