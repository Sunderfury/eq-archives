: I have a lvl 36 enchanter and a lvl 21 cleric.

: I have the same damn problem.  Both are equally important to a group. Clerics are easier to play since you don't rely on the intelligence of others so much.  However clerics will get blamed for death more often.

: I can tell you a low lvl enchanter and high lv enchanter are 2 whole different things.
: At high lvls you rarely do dmg. You clarity anyone with mana and speed up the tanks and mez the extra's.  So if you are loving the whole nuke deal and having pets....bye bye. The reason is like clerics are nukes are slow & inefficent.  However ours also get resisted more and taunt the mob more (and we have less armor).  Our pet does not engage until we get hit.
