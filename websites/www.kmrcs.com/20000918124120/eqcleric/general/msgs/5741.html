: I realized that all this stump watching is a result of people trying to get the Boots of the Reliant.

: Might I now point it out to everyone that these boots suck. 9 AC and 6 Vs Disease? Dwarven Workboots are better than these, and Bronze is damn close. Stop the stumpwatching already it just isn't worth it.

: Same goes for the Penitent, I was thinking about trying to complete that quest again (failed the first time), but then I realized that it would useless because the Greaves of the Penitent are 5 int and 5 Vs Poison.

: Yes I know, we've been over how badly most of the stats suck, I just can't figure out why everyone is still stumpwatching for the Crappiest Boots in Norrath.

: Now wandering around Nkar I can understand ... since those Bracers of the Reverent are supposedly +Wis. And the Ardent Guantlets are pretty nice too.
