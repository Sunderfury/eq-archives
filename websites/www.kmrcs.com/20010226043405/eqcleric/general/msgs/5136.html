: Well I decided to give a go at getting this item.

: I've camped at the High Preistess in kerra isle for over 30+ hours now and have only received a copper ring.

: I'm told she drops the gold ring and sometimes silver (both as rares).  

: Does she really drop the gold ring ?

: My friend told me it took them 12 hours to do the entire quest.  I'm at 30hrs and counting and still no gold ring yet...

: Consequently, is there anywhere else you can get some of the rings (other than listed in the quest).  The area is overcamped and getting a shot at Mitty is like winning the lottery.
