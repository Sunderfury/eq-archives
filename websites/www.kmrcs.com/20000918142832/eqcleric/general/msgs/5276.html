Well without "spoilers" i'd say the chance of finding these items would be almost none right now. You can run passed that stump in kithicor 100 times without knowing it "should" have been there. I spent alot of time yesterday running through kithicor forrest, looking at every burned down houses - and NOTHING. How am I supposed to know if I have been in the right place but someone have already grabbed it.<p>Without given loc's there would'nt be any 6 x 2 hours camps for each item, there would have been alot more just running around checking on the same places 200 times.<p>This is hardly a step in the right direction... Not with these silly spawn times =(..<p>-Drelzana
