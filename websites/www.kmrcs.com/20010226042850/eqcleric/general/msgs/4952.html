: Was passing through and saw this post and here's some bits from someone who plays one.

: Shamans get the following things to add to melee:

: Generally higher natural phsyical stats (although we are in envy of the high wis of many clerics)
: Stat buffs
: Debuffs - Combat Speed, AC, Str, Resistances
: Speed Buffs - SoW, Quickness, etc
: DoTs
: Frenzy line - Regneration and attack speed. Self Only
: Pets - high lvls only

: The Raw melee skills are exactly the same though. The idea of Shamans being a tank mage is only through the intelligent use of assistive spells which druids are probably better at anyways.
