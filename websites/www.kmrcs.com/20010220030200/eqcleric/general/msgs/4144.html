I usually play with the same group, so had not really had this problem before the past week or so... <br>Since my normal group of friends was not on line this past week/weekend due to rl constraints, I wandered several zones looking for a group to get in.  As a level 30 cleric, I had been expecting to just enter a zone, announce I was available, and get in a group.  Went in Solusek A, Najena (hoping to get at the fbr for a friend), forget where all else.  Saturday and Sunday basically logged on, tried the lavastorm dungeons and camped again to try a few hours later.  Do other clerics on Tunare have this same problem?  It wasn't that the zones were that crowded with clerics -- in SolA there were 18 people and 1 50th level cleric the one morning -- of course, 6 of them were above 40, just farming the good items before a yield rule gets implemented.  It seems like the groups are all using druids for healing -- saw lots of them...<br>I really wanted to hunt sol a, since there are some items there I really want to get my hands on -- but should I be looking at other dungeons if I want to find a group?  (And please don't say Unrest... I have had enough of that place for a long time...)<p>Suddenly, my rogue (the class that is broken worse than clerics) is a lot more attractive -- can always find a group then, ironically :(
