Just like the crafted quest- you should be able to buy the pieces, I guess (You pay for the "right" to loot).<p>Of course, our DD when we get them are stronger than a druids (Retribution is stronger than any DD spell a druid gets until level 49)- that and Atone should make sure I get one, which I'm not sure I'd even want.  Maybe the legs, hands and chest (esp if it has the regen effect or +wis).  Almost everything else I have gives me wis.  It would look pretty cool mixed with plate for some travel gear.  I think I'll wait until the mad rush is over and get through level 45 first.<p>As a side note, the guy who fought him said that he was a level 42 druid and he almost died....<p>I haven't been following the posts too closely about getting the armor because I think trying to doing something so soon after the patch is a waste of time- especially if I have to wait 6 hours to pick something up off the ground.  Do we have to kill or talk to Bilge?
