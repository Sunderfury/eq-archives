   The whole purpose of this "new armor" fix to camping was to fix Verant's broken economic system. It is a way to make each char who wants the armor spend 1100pp+ and thereby soak up the cash that has no where else to go. They have exacerbated the camping problem and any claims to the contrary are bs. I for one would like to take whatever lame designer who did the cleric quests out behind the barn and beat him within an inch of his life. Camping floors....now that is a GREAT idea Verant....get a clue.
