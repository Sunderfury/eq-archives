The main problem with the POF is the stupid hacks people have to use to get into the POF without getting killed one by one on zoning (camo/invis zone in one by one, move to safe spot, camp, go to chat, wait till everyone is in, all log back on at the same time, etc .... ;)). This as well as having to get everyone together (as in dragon hunt, etc ...) which doesnt happon all the time, make it pritty much a redundant zone.<p>There are plenty of high levels on the server but a lot dont play there charicters becouse 50+ people in Sol A/Lower Guk kills the zone, hunting is scarce & slow at best. At times it makes Stump watching look intresting there is so little about to kill.<p>Hinur, 39th grundge cleric of Cazic<br>Hamer, 8th level (almost as good looking) Cleric on Test<p>: Since there's a shortage of high level clerics, they're trying to encourage us to powerlevel so that there are more clerics for big game raids and PoF.  Doubt it, but it's kind of funny that this probably what's happening.<p>: Lucretia Rialsq<br>: Clerc of Tunare<br>: Bristlebane<p>
