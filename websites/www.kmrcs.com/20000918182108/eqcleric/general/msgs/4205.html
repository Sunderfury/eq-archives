What do you guys think of these big quests/dragons dropping only a small amount of loot?  My understanding of this quest is that only ONE person/server has this weapon.  Granted, this weapon REALLY kicks arse but where does that leave the other people that tried this quest?  Or how about when 40 people gather to kill a dragon and the dragon drops four items.  What about the other 36 people?  Then the exp ONLY goes to the "killing" group.  I think here needs to be better sharing of these loots and items for such tremendous events.  Maybe more "less" powerful weapons?<p>Anyway, rant off.<p>~ren<br>

: With the newest weapon added to the cleric arsenal, the ButcherBlock Hammer is adding fuel to this small rant of mine.

: 1.  I feel that this is a really cool weapon. As is the Bullsmasher (for low levels).  I really hope that Verant will come up with some better weapons for the &quot;taller&quot; races, especially at low levels.

: 2.  What do you guys think of these big quests/dragons dropping only a small amount of loot?  My understanding of this quest is that only ONE person/server has this weapon.  Granted, this weapon REALLY kicks arse but where does that leave the other people that tried this quest?  Or how about when 40 people gather to kill a dragon and the dragon drops four items.  What about the other 36 people?  Then the exp ONLY goes to the &quot;killing&quot; group.  I think here needs to be better sharing of these loots and items for such tremendous events.  Maybe more &quot;less&quot; powerful weapons?

: Anyway, rant off.
