Reavers and Undead Reavers in E.Karana….God this is the most fun I've had since my younger days in Crushbone.  My group is currently fighting here, our Druid pulls the Reavers from their camp near the river and we are having great fun here.  Last night we were all laughing so hard I had tears running down my face and could barely see to cast heal …thank God for those hotkeyed spells LOL.<br> I wouldn't call it great money but they do drop a lot of gems and our enchanter  is also a jeweler  so it pays well for us.<br> This place is just nonstop action and lots of fun. Soloing is not recommended tho heheh…not without SOW on anyway:p<p>Lydia<p><p><p>: I hunted Reavers by day and Undead Reavers by night in East Karana (the zone just outside HH, down the LONG ramp.)  I got to level 21 by soloing them and after that theres Lake Rathetear and there is some GREAT stuff there =)  You can get to level 22 hunting reavers but only the Undead ones will still give you exp at level 21 so it would be slow.  Just be careful when you pull a Reaver/Undead reaver, there are war wolves and Spirit stalkers that will attack you if you pull a reaver near them (Believe me, They run FAST.  I nearly died cause i got some on me and I couldn't out run them to safety.)  I hope this helps a little and gives you some more options =) <p>: Ziggi,<br>: Healer of Tunare,<br>: Veeshan<p>
