: First off your other skills do rival that of other classes.  You dmg vs. living while updated rarely DOES at many lvls rival that of an enchanter.  Your dmg vs undead rivals that of a wizard.<p>Hrmm, have you ever seen a level 50 ice comet spell ?  Bar none wizards are the best at DD as they should be, I really wouldn't compare our DD to theirs regardless if it is undead or not.<p>: Yet you can wear plate and heal? WOW<p>Plate at high levels means little to nothing.  You aren't up top there meleeing, you are keeping your party healed.<p>: I solo'd almost all the way to lvl 21.  I feel I could solo pretty much up until lvl 25 or 26.  Then I have to enter dungeons...only morons solo in dungeons.<p>: As far as havng a hard time finding groups....<br>: I know a few clerics who have a hard time finding groups.  They are then ones who truly are lucky to have reached the high lvl they are at...they have no strategy or tactics, can't follow orders, and act like jerks.  On the other hand my enchanter still groups with them often because..and here is the kicker....I don't go anywhere without a cleric.<p>: Right now I find it SOOO hard to find a cleric to party with.  It is always a bunch of tanks(paladins mostly) and casters. Without a cleric it is risky.  Even with a shaman or druid it is risky.<p>: Why is it so damn risky?<br>: Simple first off at lvl 36 I am fighting lvl 40 or so mobs.  They hit hard...shamans and druids can ALMOST keep up.  Clerics have no problem keeping up.  On top of that the shaman's and druids love to get that DD in there....I will be in a tough fight and hear 20 mana from one of them....they nuked all thier mana out at the start of the fight and left no mana for healing the tanks in a tough fight? How un-cleric like.<p>: If you don't like to play a cleric that is fine.  I think it shows...it shows too much.  And I bet the people you grouped with in the past noticed this...<p>Actually I've been complemented all the time I've played my ways through the levels.  The only people that have complained are the tanks who don't know the word mana and refuse to listen to party mana.  <p>: Let me ask you this...when you die do you immediately cuss out all the party members then hit disband?  I know alot of people like that in the game that can't find a group later.  They have no clue it is because people hate them and word travels fast.<p>Say what you will, experience means very little to nothing at high levels so it doesn't bother me at all when dieing.  In fact I've taken headers with mob attractants purposely so others could get out.  Its no biggie if I die, we just get back to our corpses and I res, and you have 80-90% of your exp back, no reason to get upset.<p>Alot of people I've grouped with in the past have moved on and alot I haven't seen for quite some time.  Hell just the other day I saw a guy I played with about 2 months ago who really didn't play much.  The kicker is I'm a good 17 levels above him, and grouping isn't likely.
