The quest is not hard to do - it does take some time though so be prepared.  I believe you can do it at level 9 or so-it does have to be done by short races (to use anyway).  The best way to find the mines is to go to a site that has maps and print off the city of akanon - the mines are quite a ways inside the city and can be a pain to find.  BE WARNED - DO NOT ATTACK ANY SKELETONS IN THE MINES - You will be killed by the necros that hang out in the mines (if you survive the attack from the skels).  Another note if you are a lower level, if the mobs run (particularly RED V) DO NOT Chase it, that will cause the mob to run past the guards and get killed and you get nothing.  Stay in the same spot and wait for it to come back - might take a few passes to finally kill it (unless you can root) but it is a lot safer this way.<p><p>: I want to do the Bullsmasher quest in AkAnon. Where are the Mines of Malfunction and what level do you have to be to coplete this quest solo? Also, I was told that this wep is o for the small races. Isis true?<p>: Thanks,<p>: Clarance<p>
