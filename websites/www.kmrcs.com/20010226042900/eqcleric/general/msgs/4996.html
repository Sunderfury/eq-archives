I can't provide you any insightful quotes, that will rest your worries.

Not just, blow stuff up.<p>My only consolation to you is, that perhaps you're not in the right place,, at the right time in your life.  Norrath is a large world.  Go see it, & I don't mean by gating all over the place.<br>There are many wonderous places, that you'll never see if don't run there yourself.

: I can't provide you any insightful quotes, that will rest your worries.  You see, to this point, I've NEVER had the problem of &quot;not finding a group&quot;.

: In a past life, I can remember many lonely nights, when I was a gnomish wizard.  Begging for a group.  The /tell's never came.

: In my current incarnation, not only do I remain gainfully employed, I take solace in the fact that I can help others in my party.  Not just, blow stuff up.

: My only consolation to you is, that perhaps you're not in the right place,, at the right time in your life.  Norrath is a large world.  Go see it, & I don't mean by gating all over the place.
: There are many wonderous places, that you'll never see if don't run there yourself.
