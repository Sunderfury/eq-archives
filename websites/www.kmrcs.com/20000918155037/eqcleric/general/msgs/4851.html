I have read so many posts asking how to make money as a newbie.  There is one easy way I posted in another thread.<p>Lower Guk! If you haven't killed frogs the live side of this dungeon is NOT KOS.  The frogs are lvl 30-45 or so.  They carry FS weapons and like 5 pp each and some gold.<p>HOW MIGHT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AS A NEWBIE?!?<p>Easy! Since you are not KOS just buy a bunch of FS from the people inside for 3pp or so per...yeah that sounds like alot of cash.  <p>Here is how you come up with the cash. <br>The first couple rounds you don't buy stuff...you just sell food and drink. And ask if they have spare silver and copper.  Of course they do.  We grab stacks of 200 silver and hit destroy on a regular basis. So you are getting free silver and copper and making a good deal off your food. You can probably get 15 GOLD for a stack of food.  Food is 2 silver each a stack is 4 gold.  Why? Because in one kill they make twice that.  And gold is actually begininng to become a heavy annoyance since you have 500 gold. 20 gold weigs a lb.<p>Now you can buy some FS =) AND you can exchange gold for PP.  They will pay 150 gold for 10pp so you make 5pp. This is actually more profitable then FS because FS weighs much more.<p>So if you have a high STR (t carry FS)& CHA (to sell FS) and can go in grobb and not get KOS and you have not killed ANY frogs...simply gate back to grobb with your bounty and SoW your butt back again for more =)<p>Problem is getting to lvl 5 (gate spell) without killing frogs in that area....you can do it though.<p>I assume you all know how to turn the peoples gold into plat at the bank? You go to the bank window and grab your stack of gold and drop it on your plat pile and it converts.<p>Have fun and I hope you do well....

: I have read so many posts asking how to make money as a newbie.  There is one easy way I posted in another thread.

: Lower Guk! If you haven't killed frogs the live side of this dungeon is NOT KOS.  The frogs are lvl 30-45 or so.  They carry FS weapons and like 5 pp each and some gold.

: HOW MIGHT I TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS AS A NEWBIE?!?

: Easy! Since you are not KOS just buy a bunch of FS from the people inside for 3pp or so per...yeah that sounds like alot of cash.  

: Here is how you come up with the cash. 
: The first couple rounds you don't buy stuff...you just sell food and drink. And ask if they have spare silver and copper.  Of course they do.  We grab stacks of 200 silver and hit destroy on a regular basis. So you are getting free silver and copper and making a good deal off your food. You can probably get 15 GOLD for a stack of food.  Food is 2 silver each a stack is 4 gold.  Why? Because in one kill they make twice that.  And gold is actually begininng to become a heavy annoyance since you have 500 gold. 20 gold weigs a lb.

: Now you can buy some FS =) AND you can exchange gold for PP.  They will pay 150 gold for 10pp so you make 5pp. This is actually more profitable then FS because FS weighs much more.

: So if you have a high STR (t carry FS)& CHA (to sell FS) and can go in grobb and not get KOS and you have not killed ANY frogs...simply gate back to grobb with your bounty and SoW your butt back again for more =)

: Problem is getting to lvl 5 (gate spell) without killing frogs in that area....you can do it though.

: I assume you all know how to turn the peoples gold into plat at the bank? You go to the bank window and grab your stack of gold and drop it on your plat pile and it converts.

: Have fun and I hope you do well....
