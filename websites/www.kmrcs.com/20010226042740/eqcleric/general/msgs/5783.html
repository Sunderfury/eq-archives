: Seems many players are expecting PoF armor here. And even it has very few peices that are +wis. This armor is supposed to "replace" rubcite. Which it is comaparable to. So whats the big deal. Where is this rule that class specific armor MUST add +'s to main attribute(s)? I just cant jump on this bandwagon. <p>Not all of it has to have +wis,but at present only one piece has +wis.Also there are more relevant attributes for Clerics (str,dex,agi).<br>Generally a full suit should increase your prime stat the most.Regarding your POF comment, POF adds +9 or +15 to a stat so asked for upto +5 or so is not unreasonable.Hell the ranger stuff is better suited to a cleric than what we get (Ranger Helm +5 Wis,Tunic +3Wis +3 Str).<p>As too the quests themselves that is another rant.<p><br>Mlar D'Kath<br>Priest of Innoruuk
