I've been in parties consisting of 2 or 3 clerics in SOL B and Lower Guk.  Never had a problem with anything.  In groups with 3 clerics, one goes primary nuke (nice to have the level 44 spells)- on the Dead side we have 2 go nuke against any casters.<p>We had the market on the clerics one night (with 3 or the 4 in the zone), and the other groups were yelling at us to joing their groups, it just wasn't fair for us to have all the clerics.  LOL- I get asked within 5 minutes of signing on what I'm doing and don't ever have to wait for a group.  If I'm anon I even get asked.  If it's out of my usual playing time, I ask my guild if anyone needs me then I do a shout in the zone.  2 minutes tops.  Had a problem all of once in Guk- where everything was camped to high heaven (something like 65 peeps in the zone.  Just solo'd the entry hallway ghoul froggies for 20 minutes before someone picked me up.<p>Never been my experience to not have a group when I wanted one.
