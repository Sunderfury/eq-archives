          <p><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">*Beginning Note: This guide is
          written from a Cleric’s Point of view. I did not fight in Solusek A
          to level, so I will not address how to pull and fight to gain
          experience. I will focus on some locations and rare spawns.&nbsp; I
          would like to thank Nicole and Joshua for information they posted to
          the Cleric’s Mailing List (Onelist) that helped with this guide.*</span></i></p>
          <p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt">Ed. Note: Just after
          receiving this guide an excellent map to Solusek A was released by the
          Everlore web site, it can be reached<a href="http://165.90.193.58/images/soluseka.jpg" style="color: #0000FF">
          here</a>.</span></i></b><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></i></p>
          <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Getting there</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">:
          Solusek’s Eye, or Solusek A can be found off of the Lavastorm
          Mountains. After zoning into Lavastorm, head north until you reach a
          large volcano with a Goblin Camp perched on the upper rim. Below this
          camp, down the slope and toward the lava, you will find 2 zone
          entrances. The one on the left leads to Nagafen’s Lair (Solusek B),
          the one on the right is our destination, SolA.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">*One interesting thing to note at
          this point is that these Goblins are not aggro to Dwarves unless you
          have done something to lose faction with them. It is very possible to
          walk through this entire dungeon as a Dwarf and not be attacked by
          anything except a few of the rare spawns. Once you kill the Goblins
          for a short time, you will become KOS.*<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></i></p>
          <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Entrance: </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Immediately
          after zoning into SolA and taking a few steps you will be presented
          with the aspect of this zone that scares people the most…lava. And
          indeed, this may be the worst lava spot in the entire zone. You will
          find a short flight of curved stairs that traverses the room. On
          either side of this walkway, you will find a long drop into some nasty
          lava. In most lava areas in this zone, you can easily jump back out
          onto cool dungeon stone. However, in this spot the only way I know to
          survive is to have levitate or swim through an under-lava zone point
          into a very rough area of Solusek B. Basically, do not fall here.
          There will usually be a few 20ish Goblins near or on this stair –
          don’t let them spook you. Kill them on the flat ground near the zone
          or on the far side of the stair.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Across this stair/walkway you will
          see a wall with a large crack or hole in it - climb through. You will
          encounter low to mid 20s Goblins in this entire area so stay alert.
          Take an immediate right and you will come to a ledge (still more
          Gobs). Straight in front of you and down a small drop-off you will see
          a large metal door. Directly to your right is a tunnel that will drop
          off into a circular room with another tunnel leading out of it. This
          is hall is a zone point to a relatively safe spot in SolB (though
          there is a semi-frequent Greater Kobold that will spawn on the other
          side). Back to the large metal door…<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Goblin Stronghold</span></b><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">:
          </span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Inside of that door is one
          of the main areas of what I refer to as the Goblin Stronghold. Within
          a short distance of this door you will find the Barroom (<b>Bartender
          Spawn</b>) and a <b>Goblin Vendor</b> whom you can buy and sell with
          if you have the faction (Dwarves and people with sneak or invis I
          believe). This section is quite large and the passages wind and
          interconnect like mad; getting turned around and running in circles is
          quite common. I won’t try and give exact directions in this area and
          hopefully you will find the map that accompanies this helpful. Inside
          of the Stronghold the Goblins begin to reach higher levels and in some
          spots will be 30ish (at the end of this document you will find a list
          of Goblin types from lowest to highest level). In this area you will
          find MOBs like the <b>Bartender</b>, <b>Goblin Drunkard</b>, <b>Goblin
          High Shaman</b> and <b>Goblin King</b>. There all also passages that
          will take you to other spawn spots such as the <b>Kobold Predator</b>
          and the <b>Goblin Foreman</b> (these 2 will be referenced again).
          Please see another appendix at the end of this guide that will list
          what these MOBs drop as loot.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Let us move back to the ledge again,
          facing the doorway to the Goblin Stronghold. If you turn left on this
          ledge you will see some Goblins (2 or 3) standing in front of some
          hallways that branch off from the path you are on. You will need to
          fight, sneak, or – if you’re a lucky dwarf – walk by them and
          take the first right that you are able to (this excludes the secret
          wall on the right that leads into the Goblin Stronghold). You should
          now begin to see Gnomes. The hall you are in will dead-end into a
          small alcove with a doorway that leads to an L-shaped bridge spanning
          some lava- cross this. Continue on, past the swinging pendulum (it
          will not hurt you, it is just for &quot;looks&quot;) and you will come
          to a larger room with a lava lake. Point yourself to the left side of
          the room and you will see the Castle of the Solusek Mining Company
          (all hands on deck! Gnomes ahead!)<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The Solusek Mining Company</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">:
          To get over to the castle, you must jump into (almost over) and swim a
          very small section of lava. Do yourself a favor and pick the smallest
          width and take a leap over to the rock ground in front of the castle.
          You should not even take the typical 40 points of lava damage if you
          do this correctly. There is no real danger in this.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">**NOTE: If you are of an evil
          race or have bad faction with Gnomes in general, you will most likely
          have been attacked before you get this far. If you are KOS here but
          have somehow managed to sneak into this area, I do not suggest
          continuing on. There are Gnomes and Clocks every few steps in the
          castle and many of them are in the high 20s and low 30s. Killing
          Kobolds in Solusek B will raise your faction with this group of Gnomes
          (Solusek Mining Co faction).**<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></i></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">There are two drawbridges here. The
          one on the left leads to various Gnomes and Gnome Clockworks, and a
          secret wall that eventually will lead to the Goblin Foreman and Kobold
          Predator (there is an easier way to get to them), but nothing
          particularly noteworthy. Nothing that I have found anyway. The bridge
          on the right is where we are headed…click on it and cross.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Once inside, follow the hall until
          you come to a 7-turn. Directly after this, on the left, you will see a
          set of steps going down. Go down the steps and push the button on the
          wall to open the door on your right. Go through the next 2 doors and
          turn to the left. Standing here you will see a door in front of you
          and a door to the right. The door on the right leads to a small room
          with a Gnomish Vendor. He sells the Bag of the Tinkerers. It sells for
          around 6,000pp. Buy it if you like. He is very helpful to those
          fighting in SolB who need to unload items without running to the
          gypsies in Lavastorm. He does not sell food or drink.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">**NOTE: when fighting the Gnomes
          and Clockworks mentioned below – if your faction is not above
          indifferent, other MOBs in the area will attack you as well. If you
          are amiable or above, they will not bother you though they may heal
          the MOB you are killing. Healers are not common here. Also, when
          killing these MOBs you will lose faction with the Mining Co and some
          groups in Ak’anon. Unless you are &quot;farming&quot; items you
          should not go KOS anywhere – that is, if you were not close to KOS
          to begin with (but then you would be getting gang-banged here when
          attacking). Killing Kobolds in SolB will raise your Solusek Mining
          Company faction, but not the Ak’anon faction.**<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></i></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The door in front of you houses the
          spawn point of <b>Gabbie Mardoddle</b>. Gabbie’s rare drop is one of
          the most sought-after items in the game, the Molten Cloak (4AC +4 WIS
          and INT). Gabbie spawns behind the desk in the small room. Gabbie is
          in the low or mid 30s and a caster. She can do a lot of damage in a
          small amount of time and if you do not kill her quickly, she will kill
          you. I have seen level 45+ tanks have trouble with her if she gets a
          few spells off. A level 50 Cleric (or a 44+) can enstill, stun and
          nuke her to death in about 20 seconds – rarely do I lose more than a
          bubble of health. I strongly suggest having a magic resistance buff on
          you. <o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Her spot pops about every 20
          minutes, but it is very well known for skipping a spawn or two and not
          popping for 40 minutes to an hour (or more, ugh). Like most rare
          spawns, other MOBs will spawn in her spot (clockworks) and you will
          need to clear them. These clockworks are no pushovers and can hit
          hard. I am guessing they are in the low 30s.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Gabbie’s common drop is the
          Mithril Quill, a 4 damage 19 delay piercing weapon – pretty much
          worthless. You will see a lot of quills before the cloak unless you
          get extremely lucky. It took me about 15 spawns to get the cloak,
          which amounted to about 30 hours of non-consecutive playing time. As
          far as I am concerned, this is one of the longest and most frustrating
          camps in the game. Luckily, if you want to be an item hound, there are
          several other spawns very close by.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Near the door that leads to Gabbie,
          you will find a portcullis. Open it and go through. You are now in a
          small courtyard area that actually appears to be the font of the
          castle (there is a way to go up top and see the ballistas and
          Clockworks keeping watch over the battlements). To your right there is
          a hall leading out of this courtyard. Take it. In the hall you will
          see some Gnomish Conjurers and Miners – basically more of the same
          that you saw in the castle. Keep going on the path until you cross two
          bridges and come to a square room that should have two Clockworks in
          it. Stop. From here back to the portcullis is the walking path of the <b>Clockwork
          Model EXG</b>. <o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The EXG’s common drop is the
          Charred Guardian Shield (10AC +9 WIS) and the rare drop is the Charred
          Guardian Breastplate (16AC +3 STR +6 STA - LORE ITEM). The EXG is a
          female Clockwork who is larger than the rest of the clocks. If she is
          carrying the shield, you will see it on her. If not, she has the
          chest. She will pace back and forth between the square room and the
          castle portcullis. She is around level 30, hits hard and TOTALLY
          resistant to magic. This means that you can not root and nuke at all.
          You will need a tank. A level 50 Cleric can buff and Symbol and then
          heal in battle and solo the EXG down with melee, but it is very rough.
          As she paces between the castle and back room, the Gnome Conjurers
          will buff her. I suggest you Nullify Magic on her a few times before
          engaging. The best spot to fight her is on the castle-side of the
          larger bridge. There is a decent amount of room here, no other MOBs
          nearby to help if you do not have good faction, and no one in healing
          range.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Like Gabbie, the EXG spot spawns
          every 20 minutes or so and has &quot;placeholders&quot; that will
          spawn. These are other Clockworks and a Clockwork Spider Model SX.
          These are not quite at tough as the EXG and they can be cast upon.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Other Rare Spawns</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt">:
          There are several rare spawns within a short jaunt of the Gnome
          Castle. They may drop items that you need, or they may simply help
          relieve the boredom of camping Gabbie or the EXG.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><b>Reckless Efreeti</b>: The
          Reckless Efreeti can be found behind the Gnomish Castle. Go out the
          back door of the Gnome area where the two guards stand in the square
          room. (the point at which the EXG turns around and walks back to
          castle). You will be at a T intersection. This entire area has Goblins
          in it so be prepared. Turn to your right and you will see a spike trap
          that opens and closes in the hall. There are two ways you can get to
          the Efreeti from here: go past the trap (like all others, it will not
          hurt you) and hug the left wall – you will fall into a pit with two
          Blazing Elementals (mid 20s?) and possibly the Efreeti. The other way
          to reach this spot and possibly be more certain of what is in the pit
          is to go into the doorway (no door) on the left before you reach the
          spike trap. Take the next door to the right and open the other door
          after it. In this room you will see a table and probably a Gob or two.
          Facing in from the door, the corner to your immediate right is a
          secret wall. Go into the wall and you will be in the Efreeti pit.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The Efreeti spot spawns every 40
          minutes or so and is located near the back of this small pit room. He
          drops the Platinum Armbands (No AC +3 WIS +3 STR) or the rare Obsidian
          Flamberge (20 dmg 50 dly effect: Obsidian Shatter WAR SK 2H Sword - No
          Drop/Lore). The bands are a very good item for Druids, and possibly
          others who have chosen to sacrifice AC for 3 wisdom. The Efreeti is
          most likely in the high 20s and is quite easy for a Cleric or Caster
          to kill. He only has around 1100 hit points. The two Elementals guard
          the Efreeti and spawn on a 20 minute cycle (so his spot spawns once
          every two of theirs). As far as I have seen, the two Ele’s are aggro,
          the Efreeti is not. A third Elemental will spawn in the Efreeti spot
          when he does not pop. Clear them all to get him to spawn and check
          back every 20 or so. There is a way to clear the Ele’s without
          having to do any real fighting – this is pretty obvious and I will
          let you find it out for yourself!<o:p>

          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><b>Goblin Captain</b>: The Captain
          can be found a few doors down from the Efreeti. Get your bearings in
          the room where the secret wall to the pit is. There are only two
          doors: the one you came in and the one you are about to go through to
          reach the Captain. Open the door and step into the Banner Room. I
          suppose it is worth mentioning that this area if full of mid 20s
          Goblins – be careful and don’t go alone if they are aggro to you.
          This room has for doors and, the captain is through the one directly
          in front of you. His spawn spot is in the middle of the back wall in
          this small room. Like everything else, his spot pops about every 20
          minutes and he does not spawn every time. There are two other Goblins
          that spawn in this room as well. The Captain’s common drop is
          Charred Boots (AC6 +3 AGI +5 vs Fire and Poison) and rare is Charred
          Gauntlets (AC7 +3 DEX +5 INT). Both of these items are plate based
          armor.<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><b>Singe and Kindle</b>: Both of
          these MOBs wander the Goblin areas of SolA. Singe is a Fire Drake,
          Kindle a Fire Imp. Both are in the Mid to High 20s I believe. There
          are certain spots that players will camp to find these MOBs, but the
          place that I have come across them most often is at the T-intersection
          directly behind the Gnome’s backdoor (around the Spike Trap). Their
          &quot;holders&quot; wander by here. If you are looking for Singe and
          Kindle, kill the wandering Gobs and eventually they will pop. Singe
          carries the Obsidian Bead Hoop (AC2 +3 AGI +3 INT) and the Drake Scale
          Belt (AC5 +3 DEX +10 vs Fire). Kindle carries the Obsidian Ring (AC3
          +3 DEX +10 HP) and the highly prized Imp Skin Gloves (AC2 +5 INT +10
          Mana).<o:p>

          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><b>Goblin Foreman and Kobold
          Predator</b>: You will find these two spawns between the Gnome Castle
          and the entrance from Lavastorm. Let us backtrack a little to L-bridge
          that brought us to the pendulum and lava room at the first. From this
          bridge, heading toward the pendulum…when you reach the end of the
          bridge – stop. There is a hallway to your left, take it. A few steps
          down this hall you will see a doorway. A few feet after this doorway,
          on the same wall, you will see a charred/darkened section of the wall.
          This is a secret door, go through it. You are now in another hallway.
          Go forward and take your first left, then right, then left again and
          you should be looking at a another secret doorway (you can usually
          tell by the small holes in the surface). Behind this wall is a small
          room with a well structure in it and three Goblins. The Foreman spawns
          in the middle spot here. Others will spawn in his spot. The Foreman
          Drops the Foreman Tunic (10AC 0 weight +3 STR +3 WIS) or the Obsidian
          Scimitar (6 dmg 27 dly +6 AGI).<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">There is one door in the Foreman’s
          room. This leads to another room with a set of steps. On top of the
          steps, is where you will find the Kobold Predator. This is doggie is
          in the mid 20s and drops the Kobold-Hide Boots (AC5 +3 AGI +10 HP) and
          the rare Obsidian Shard (6 dmg 25 dly Effect: Obsidian Shatter).<o:p>
          </o:p>
          </span></p>
          <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">That is about if for the spawns, but
          I will leave you with this: There are rumors that there are more
          rare-spawn Gnomes in the Castle areas. There are also rumors of a full
          set of Charred Plate Armor coming from SolA. There is also one spawn
          that I have left unmentioned, due to the fact that it is so unknown I
          will wait to add it until it has become closer to common knowledge. It
          does not drop a cleric item.<o:p>

          <p><i><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><b>Zones to Solusek B</b></span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt">:
          There are several from SolA to SolB. The closest one to the Lavastorm
          entrance one is mentioned at the first of this guide. It is the zone
          near the ledge in front of the Stronghold. The Second is fairly tough
          to get to and found behind a secret wall in the middle of the
          Stronghold. It should be reflected on the map. The third and fourth
          zones are located near each other and can be found behind the Gnome
          Castle. Standing at the T-intersection, instead of turning right
          toward the spike-trap, turn left. The hall will immediately open into
          a small room area with a hall and door to the right. Go through this
          door and you are in yet another room (Gobs all around of course) there
          is a door to the right of you and a door in front. The door in front
          leads to a hallway that is a zone. The door on the right leads to a
          room that has a hallway to the left that is a zone. Those are all of
          the zones from A to B that I know of.<o:p>
