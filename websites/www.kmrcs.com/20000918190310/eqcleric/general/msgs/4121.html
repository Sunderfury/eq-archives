Admittedly i don't have it yet,but for it to be usefull at least 4 members of the group have to be hurt.Also if used post battle using it must be more efficient than other combinations.In General from what i have heard complete heal for tanks wins hand down(Post battle),thus there are less people who would benefit from it hence reducing efficiency.I would think that WOH would be of most use if the group had been hit by an AE spell(ie to quickly heal casters a bit before concentrating on tanks again)<p>Mlar D'Kath<br>Priest of Innoruuk
