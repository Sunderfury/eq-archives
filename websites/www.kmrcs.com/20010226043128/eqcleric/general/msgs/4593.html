That testament of vaneer is pretty crappy.

Several of which are 50th. And guess what?  In beta there was a quest for evil races for an awesome hammer (Blued 2H hammer) and there were NO quest for us dwarves. That didnt deter me from chosing a dwarven cleric however. <br>: Just please tell me how does lack of quest and crappy quest gear make playing a DE SO hard? Those crappy items are not "earth shattering" uber weapons. Jeesh..you act like its such an advantage when its not.<p>: : I wonder if you even know how hard playing a DE cleric can be.  Most of the cleric specific quests are off<br>: : limits to DE's because they are KOS.  How would you like Verant to make a cleric only quest based in Neriak?<br>: : I bet you would be complaining about how good races are left out.<br>: : Having a  seperate DE cleric quest or making the items for quests available to both good and evil races will <br>: : solve the problem.   <p>: : : with this DE crying.
