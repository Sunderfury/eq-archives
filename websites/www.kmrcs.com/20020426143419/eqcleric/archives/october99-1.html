            <p>You may have noticed that a <a href="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi?action=intro">test
            board</a> using the Ultimate BBS package was installed.&nbsp; The
            Ultimate BBS package is very nice, it has a lot of features in the
            licensed version, creating forums is brainless, all in all a nice
            package.&nbsp; It just has this one little quirk: the layout of the
            messages is really odd.&nbsp; I personally like threaded messages.&nbsp;
            My favorite board (appearance wise) is that used by the Crossroads
            site (Britain, Norrath).&nbsp; My second favorite is the EQ Vault,
            excepting the fact that it barely works.</p>
            <p>Here's my question: does anybody know of a package that supports
            both threaded messages and the kind that the Ultimate BBS package
            uses?&nbsp; I'd love to use something that gives a user-selectable
            appearance.</p>
            <p>Second question:&nbsp; how many forums do we want?&nbsp; Should
            we split up the board into spells, quests, rants, and general?&nbsp;
            Or just one grab bag?</p>
            <p>Your input is welcome as always.</p>

          <p><b><font color="#804040">&quot;An update from your sponsor&quot;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>This week has been a mixed bag for this site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>On one hand, Verant has added a slew of new quests to the game,
            including a bunch for our class.&nbsp; Whether you like the quests
            and armor or not, I think Verant deserves our thanks for making a
            positive change in the game.&nbsp; While I am a little sad that I'll
            never have the chance to camp for Rubicite (our group certainly had
            it's opportunities), I feel that the quests are a positive step
            towards reducing the camping. Anything that Verant can implement in
            their software to reduce camping (and thereby not have to enforce
            with GMs) is something to be applauded.</p>
            <p>On one hand, our board has been &quot;discovered&quot; by a less
            than desirable clientele.&nbsp; By less desirable I do not mean
            players of classes other than clerics who come to share their
            viewpoint on the cleric class.&nbsp; Player viewpoints are always
            welcome as they often give us another perspective.&nbsp; Instead, I
            am referring to those players who insist on making inflammatory
            posts on the cleric class, those who make insults against the class
            or other posters, and those who bring up topics (sexual preferences,
            hate groups such as Nazis, etc) that are totally inappropriate for a
            hobby message board.</p>
            <p>The message board is a place for players to share ideas about the
            cleric class specifically and the Everquest game in general.&nbsp;
            Off topic posts are welcome, as long as they are of a nature that
            they are suitable for young children to read.&nbsp; This <b>is not</b>
            a place to discuss adult themes (i.e. R rated topics), sexual
            practices, politics, hate groups, or your horrible childhood.&nbsp;
            If the word cannot be said on television (I mean network TV, not
            cable) leave it out.&nbsp; Do not make direct insults against other
            posters.&nbsp; If you disagree with someone, restrict your comments
            to the ideas, not the person.&nbsp;&nbsp; This board is a
            non-confrontational place to discuss Everquest.&nbsp; Period.</p>
            <p>End of Board Etiquette 101.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;<b><font color="#804040">Message Board</font></b></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Now that I'm not pushing petitions or anything contentious we get
            very few flames on the board, but I saw one concerning the message
            board.&nbsp; While I can't say I was enthralled with the person's&nbsp;
            presentation, I can sympathize with their feelings about the board.&nbsp;
            For those of you who do not access it with a T3 I suspect it's slow.&nbsp;
            Also, the script is not the latest in technology.&nbsp; Here are my
            thoughts on the subject:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I hate the EZBoard format, so unless I get my hands on a
                script that supports both don't expect to see it.&nbsp; My
                complaint about it is I cannot tell at a glance who is
                responding to who.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>For some reason, I had a lot of trouble installing RPGBoard.&nbsp;
                Our guild's website uses it, and I love the way the board works
                there, but I had trouble getting it to work well here.&nbsp;
                Since I am now admin of that site also, I plan on snagging the
                script they have and then hand-modifying it to see if I can get
                it working here.&nbsp; If I can make it work here that's what I
                will implement.</li>
              <li>I realize I'm due to archive the current board; expect it to
                be done this weekend.&nbsp; But remember, as usual, I retain the
                right to procrastinate; playing the game comes first =).</li>
              <li>A trick I use when reading messages is I open a new window for
                every thread I read.&nbsp; I use this technique on practically
                every board I visit.&nbsp; It works for me; it might help some
                of you out.</li>
              <li>Finally, the quality of a board is not determined by the
                script it runs on, but rather by the value of the information
                received/imparted.&nbsp; There are a number of excellent posters
                here who make this an great place to gain information on the
                cleric class.</li>
