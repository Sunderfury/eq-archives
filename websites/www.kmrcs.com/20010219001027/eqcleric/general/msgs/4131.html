I was just at the eq'lizer web site and they have a rough map with some of the<br>NPC and the quest they give. One i noted was specialization removal. I specialized in Evocation by mistake, it was first implemented (before they put the names of the specialization fields on the gm training screen)<br>Seem i may be able to correct the situation when they move it to real servers. And BTW this place is in Lavastorm across from the Sol A and B entrances. <br>Although i will miss my low cost Retributions
