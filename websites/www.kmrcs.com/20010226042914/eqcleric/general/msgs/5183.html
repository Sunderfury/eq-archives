But even with 200+ WIS, I still get resisted some on mobs that are blue to me. So there is obviously a roll for this, but I think it is much better for you if high WIS. I sometimes have all 3 stuns loaded and holy might will be resisted but force hits for full damage. Again, just another example of random roll affecting it.<p>AND for all those interested in having fun - stuns are a great way to spice up the fighting. In a good group I rarely have to sit and med ALL the time so when I am full mana or close I stand and melee and stun. It's great fun stunning casters so that they die in seconds. It's also great fun timing your holy might or force so that you get the final hit and the "You have slain" message :) Last night our group was rolling with real laughter when I got the "you have slain" message 5 times in a row on lizards in Cazic.
