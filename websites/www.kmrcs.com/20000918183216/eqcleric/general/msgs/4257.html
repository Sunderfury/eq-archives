True complete heal is not used in alot of situations because of its casting time and nature. I personally dont use it unless the tank has 2000+ hps. Then, in most cases you can safetly begin casting at 50% health (or 60% if hes getting really pounded). If the last mob is fixing to go down ill not heal the tank at all till after combat. Also theres nothing more horrible than casting a CH and your tank dieing right as it hits him.<br>As a basic formuala for standard situations if it takes 2 superiors to heal up a tank you should use CH instead. Usually CH is restrited to barb, ogre, and troll warriors. I have used it on some high level paladins and SKs however.<p>: Well in tougher battles (the only ones that count) complete heal is not a good thing to use if you don't have one or two backup healers. When you start casting that complete heal (it takes alot of time) on the main tank who needs it. If some caster gets jumped and needs an emergency heal - You are totally helpless to rescue him. And casters can drop FAST at higher levels, believe me.<p>: Most of the time seperior heal will have to do. Until they do something about the casting time on complete heal (i personally think it should be faster to cast each level, but it's not right?)<p>
