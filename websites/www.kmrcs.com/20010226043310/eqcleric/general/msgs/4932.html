You should realise that Rayne does not remove every and any post which has a different opinion.<br>As long as your post is well reasoned and polite it stays,it is only the ones brimming with profanity which get removed,and there i agree with Rayne.Even though my opinion does not matter since it is his board.<p>Basically as long as you say it politly and well you can state any opinion you like,just don't swear.<br>
