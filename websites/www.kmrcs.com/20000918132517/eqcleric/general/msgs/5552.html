Well I'm certainly not going after them full force but just plan to look for the items whenever I have "free" time and no one else is on.  Also, I seem to run through Kithicor alot lately and will just stop by the spots and check on them when I'm in the area.  If I'm really bored I'll just sit and wait.<p>I know they are not the BEST armor out there but will probably just like to get what I can for that "status" look.  Karana knows I'm not one for doing quests but might be time to get my butt in gear and actually start learning more history about this land of ours.<p>If you have any other info on the other quest just let me know.  Never know when you might be in an area and you can always just stop by and take a quick look for a quest item :) <p>PS, what's this about a water pillar in upper guk?
