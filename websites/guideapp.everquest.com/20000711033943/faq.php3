<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>Please re-read the message carefully. It says that you'll receive an e-mail only if accepted. Normally, this e-mail will be sent out 1-2 weeks after the application has been graded and passed.<BR><BR><BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>How can I find out what my score was, the application site doesn't say?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>The application has two status messages: one that your application has yet to be graded, and the other that it has been graded and you'll be contacted if accepted.  We cannot give out individual scores, and you'll know if you passed if you receive an email invitation to join the program.<BR><BR><BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>I've changed my email address since I sent in my application, what can I do?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>If your application is either ungraded or was graded less than two weeks ago, send an email to the Application Administrator at the address below.<BR><BR><BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>I filled out the application and I've been checking back every few days for it to be graded. I would always get the message stating it hadn't been graded, until one day I tried and it took me to a page to fill out a brand new application... what gives?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>Periodically we delete any applications which have been graded, but failed to earn a passing score. This is to allow those individuals to reapply in a timely fashion.<BR><BR><BR></TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><B>Q:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>I'm trying to reapply, and the site tells me that I've already submitted an application. Why won't it let me reapply?</TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="top"><B>A:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>There is a waiting period of one month after you submit an application. After one month has passed since you last applied, you will be able to fill out the application again.</TD></TR>
