<hr>

<p>Welcome to my EverQuest site, devoted to the astoundingly enchanting world of Norrath,
developed by Sony Interactive Studios America. Their game, <a
href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_new">EverQuest</a>, promises to revolutionize the
field of online gaming. Seeped in the fantasy traditions of tableside gaming such as <a
href="http://www.tsrinc.com" target="_new">Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, <a
href="http://www.ironcrown.com" target="_new">Rolemaster</a>, and <a
href="http://www.sjgames.com" target="_new">GURPS Fantasy</a>, as well as the literary
traditions of such novelists as J. R. R. Tolkien, Margaret Weiss &amp; Tracy Hickman, and
R. A. Salvatore, EverQuest offers a true outlet for anyone who has ever envisioned an Elf,
proudly standing on a precipice with his lordly locks blowing in the wind, or of an Orc,
gnashing his jagged, tooth-filled maw while he cleaves downward viciously with his axe. </p>

<p>Add to this richly imaginative fantasy setting the technological aspect: 3Dfx compliant
using the latest Direct 3D technology, first person perspective ala Quake or Doom,
polygonal characters who can be personalized, rich sounds, and 1000 or so people online
per server, with the commitment to advanced code that promises to reduce lag. Anyone who
has every played <a href="http://www.ultimaonline.com" target="_new">Ultima Online</a> can
definitely appreciate the last comment regarding lag... </p>

  <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Naming Convention</font><font size="3">. According to a <a
    href="http://eqvault.questgate.net/com/eqdevboard/messages/332.html" target="_new">recent
    post</a> by Brad McQuaid, the producer of the game,the player must choose a name that is
    within the &quot;high fantasy genre.&quot; That means none of those foolish &quot;c00L
    d00D&quot; idiots who ruin both Diablo and Ultima Online with their unimaginative
    childsplay. Forgive my tirade, but EverQuest is NOT to be a graphical chatroom. Keep the
    casing and lack of roleplaying to the teen webchats, please.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4">3Dfx and Direct 3D</font><font size="3">. One cannot
    emphasize enough the wonder of this technology. My wife's gift this past holiday season,
    the 3Dfx card in my machine eagerly awaits EverQuest's stimuli. This devotion to brilliant
    graphics will emphasize the stunning landscapes as your Troll gazes down a cliffside at a
    group of marching Gnomes, or else bring to vivid life the water splashing around your Dark
    Elven warrior as he dives into underwater caverns. Brad McQuaid even recently verified
    that the new Voodoo 2 chipset will work with EQ! With all that, though, there is still the
    <em>choice of a variety of viewpoints</em>, from first person, to many topside views, for
    tactical maneuvers.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Variety in Gaming</font><font size="3">. With 12 races
    and 14 classes, there should be no end to the hours of gameplay possible. Hopefully, if
    one does not opt for the &quot;tank mage&quot; thinking of Ultima Online, each of the
    combinations of race and profession allowable will be explored by the players. As a
    balancing issue, not all races can be all classes, which is not such a bad thing; I would
    cringe at the idea of a brutally strong Troll being able to cast the most damaging Wizard
    spells! The range includes the popular Dark Elf, with the characteristic blue-black skin
    and white hair of Drizzt Du'orden, as well as the more lordly High Elf, such as Legolas;
    there proves to be variety in both culture and racial choices in Norrath.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4">To PK or not to PK</font><font size="3">. That is the
    question. The creators of EverQuest actually listened to the complaints of Ultima Online
    players, who, after months of building up a beloved character, gets ambushed by a gang of
    teenage thugs (PK's, or &quot;player killers&quot;), all chanting &quot;F**k you
    d00d&quot; or some other obscenity. Finally, a game comes along that permits those who
    want to wargame to wargame, and those who just want to roleplay to roleplay. During
    character creation, one can opt whether or not to have one's &quot;PK switch&quot; turned
    on, allowing inter-player combat, or turned off, not permitting one to be harmed by
    another player. Certain actions one takes can allow the switch to become activated,
    though, such as aiding a PK friend or the like, so don't think of it as an invulnerability
    switch! (Credit to Designer Dragon of UO: he did make an eloquent explanation of why he
    doesn't believe a &quot;PK switch&quot; was the correct road for UO, but I would at least
    prefer the option).</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4">3Dfx</font><font size="4">. </font><font size="3">Did I
    mention this already? :)</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Ogres and Trolls as Player Races</font><font size="3">.
    One of my favorite characters in a Rolemaster campaign was an Ogre played by my brother,
    who, when we were backed in a corner and accused by crooked town guards of assaulting an
    insane snitch with whom we were only previously conversing, promptly picked up the small
    man and said &quot;that's not assault! THIS is assault!&quot; and brained the guy against
    the wall. Ah, the good ol' days.... </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Over 40 unique skills</font><font size="3"> should allow
    for plenty of variety and individualization, including innate racial abilities. I wonder
    if Dark Elves will get &quot;Faerie Fire?&quot; :)</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4">A unique magic system</font><font size="3">. Admittedly,
    details of this system have not yet been released, but it will provide a basis for the
    magical classes, which include the Cleric, who can heal and channel the power of his/her
    deity; the Paladin, a combination of Warrior and Cleric; the Necromancer, who can animate
    the dead and steal lifeforce from opponents; the Shadow Knight, a combination of Warrior
    and Necromancer; Magician, the summoners and conjurers of Norrath; Wizard, who tap the
    flow of magic directly, allowing for powerfully destructive spells; Enchanters, who can
    both magically augment and enchant items, as well as charm people; and Druids, who tap the
    natural world's inherent power. Will the system use mana, spellbooks, spell
    components/reagents? We don't know yet, but there will be &quot;hundreds&quot; of spells.</font></li>
