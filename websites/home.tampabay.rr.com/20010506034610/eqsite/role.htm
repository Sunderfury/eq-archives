<p><font size="5">Roleplaying vs. Internet norms</font></p>

<hr>

<p>With a game like EverQuest, it is very important to remember that it is a High Fantasy
Roleplaying game. This is not an online graphical chat; the normal internet decorum does
not apply. The words you type are the words you say, and how many High Elves in Middle
Earth, for example, would say &quot;brb&quot; or &quot;kewl?&quot;</p>

<p>The game has several methods of portraying action, including the emote ability. Instead
of :), use one of two options: preface your emoted text with a colon (:) or with /em,
e.g., /em smiles devilishly.&nbsp; And, the &quot;social&quot; buttons can be customized
by right-clicking them and assigning emotes; these commonly used, buttonized emotes can be
hotkeyed by YOU! *hehe, inside joke :P*<br>
<br>
Other great tools for expressing yourself through your character are the various actions
that the game designers have incorporated, including:<br>
/cry<br>
/cheer<br>
/wave<br>
/rude or /gesture</p>

<p>Hopefully they will create actions for these also:<br>
/panic<br>
/rofl<br>
/smile<br>
<br>

<hr>

<p>When you create a character, you are doing more than choosing a face and calculating
your stats. Your character is alive in the world of Norrath; make him or her live and
breathe! If you are only going to be a powerhungry Wizard, then play him or her that way,
such as with a desperate look or an insane laugh.</p>

<p>Ideally, your character should <font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>start with a concept </strong></em></font>(although
it can be fun to pick one on a whim during character creation). As you make your new
character concept, imagine what events in the character's life caused him to reach the
goal of being trained in his profession. Was her mother killed by Orcs, thus causing the
young Wood Elf to train as a Ranger to better protect her homeland? Did your family's
social niche put pressure on you to become a particular profession, such as a noble house
in the Dark Elven society being more geared toward Wizardry?&nbsp; As you get to know
Norrath better, you will come to learn of the various factions and power struggles that
lie at the heart of the game; use these existing paradigms to your advantage while
creating a new character concept.</p>

<p>Once the basic history, in a general sense, develops, you should have a more clear
understanding of <font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>what kind of goals</strong></em></font>
your character seeks. Is she a wanderer, without a home, content to have no lasting place?
Is the recovery of an important artifact his consuming passion, since his grandfather died
while trying to locate the same object? Is he content with debauchery and ill-gotten
wealth, and if so, why? Does he follow a code of conduct or is he amoral?&nbsp; Is your
Troll seeking revenge because the Greenbloods ate his mother?</p>

<p>It might be fun to decide <font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>what kind of quirks</strong></em></font>
your character displays, making him or her more unique. Does he cough often, due to a low
Stamina and thus a more difficult ability to fight disease? Does she smile and wink at
strangers flirtatiously? Does your halfling feel the need to stand on barstools at taverns
to have that &quot;eye to eye&quot; feeling with other patrons?&nbsp; Or does your
halfling feel the need to &quot;jump cutely?&quot;</p>

<p>Some gamers, myself included, like to <font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>draw a sketch
of the character</strong></em></font>, bringing more into focus the physical extension of
themselves in another world. Of course, items of clothing you add to your inventory will
fluctuate, but a commonly worn set of clothes or a typically sought look can be conveyed
if you have enough patience.</p>

<p>If you find it helpful, you could <font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>write a background
story</strong></em></font>, which would help you nail down the most important and
life-changing events in your character's life. Is your Dwarf afraid of boats because of a
racial stereotype, or did his brave Uncle Rowan Strongaxe drown after being capsized by
cowardly assassins? It is very enriching for both yourself <em>and</em> the gamers around
you if you can refer to the causes of your phobia against dark places, for example, or if
you have &quot;real&quot; reasons to distrust anyone of the Rogue profession.&nbsp; Did
the Orcs of Crushbone slay your half-elven mistress while on her way to the Lesser
Faydark?</p>

<p>Remember to <font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>stay in character</strong></em></font>.
Don't just start acting completely differently unless you have legitimate reason, such as
losing some of your morals due to a disillusioned feeling after witnessing many violent
crimes. This is especially important to the classes which must abide by a code of conduct
(presumably), such as the Paladin and the Cleric, who can lose favor and (possibly) lose
powers if their god is displeased.&nbsp; Remember that people around you will be easily
inspired to roleplay and create an in-game persona if they overhear your conversations in
character.</p>

<p><font size="5">Name thyself</font></p>

<hr>

<p>One of the most important parts of bringing your character to life is the name, one of
the first impressions anyone who wants to get to know you will deal with. A suitable
fantasy name has already been insisted upon by the game designers, as reflected by the
Name Filter during character creation and the ability of Guides to change any
inappropriate names. Naming is not difficult, as many sources of fantasy literature and
mythology can provide word roots and examples to emulate. <br>
<br>
Another great web-based tool is a fantasy name generator, which can come in handy if you
are in a pinch or having a mental block. Some good resources:

    (onomastikon)</a></li>
</ul>

    Earth Game's Name Generator</a>.&nbsp; Another excellent name generator for fantasy
    gaming.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pleae don't plagiarize, though. I have seen dozens of Dark Elves whose names were a
derivative of&nbsp; Drizzt... ugh! YOU can be as creative as any author, just give it a
try!</p>
