<p>The planet on which you live, grow, struggle, and possibly die is known as Norrath.
There are rumors of possible lands beyond or below the sea, and even of extra dimensional
space, but these notions are largely discounted by rational folk. (*Two words: <em>Expansion
Packs!</em>*) These are the five known continents of Norrath which make up the known
hemisphere.&nbsp; Currently, on the continents of Odus, Antonica, and Faydwer are
available for adventuring, but so are the Planes of Hate, Fear, and Air... </p>

<p>The mainland of<font color="#FF0000"><em><strong> Antonica</strong></em></font> was the
original land in which Humans proved themselves. The harsh climate of the Northlands are
home to the Barbarians, and some of the oldest settlements, such as Freeport and Qeynos,
were created by Men. It is not exclusively the province of humanity; Ogres, Dark Elves,
Trolls, and Halflings are also inhabitants of this continent.</p>

<p>The island of <font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Odus</strong></em></font> was settled
by the Erudites, searching for their own path, lands, and destinies. It is still the
domain of the Erudites, or High Men.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Faydwer</strong></em></font> is home to the High
Elves, Woodland Elves, Dwarves, and the Gnomish folk. It is a veritable province of
demihumans. </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Kunark </strong></em></font>is a land not to be
trusted. It is unsettled, dangerous, and the source of many legends.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Velious </strong></em></font>is likewise uninhabited
by mannish races, being a frigid, icy lair supposedly home to dragons and their ilk.</p>
