<p><font size="5">Races of Norrath</font></p>

<hr>

<p>There has been limited information regarding the races and the particulars of their
culture, but here is what we know: there are 12 player races, and there are also NPC races
with which you can interact, such as Orcs and Gnolls. You can be either male or female,
but not all races can be all classes! Traditionally, after all, Halflings have been less
proficient in the magical arts, as have Trolls... 

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000">Humans</font>. </font><font size="3">This is the
    normal, average of all the races, by which other races are compared. They will undoubtedly
    not get innate special abilities, but will have a wide variety of classes available.
    &nbsp; Additionally, they do not have the experience penalties that many other races
    share.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Barbarians</font><font size="3">. This race is an
    offshoot of the normal humans, a much more hardy and physical variety, as is to be
    expected from their wintery home of Halas. They are less cultured than the average human,
    and more warlike. The rugged cold of the Northlands makes for a strong people, with hearts
    inspired to the Justice of the Tribunal. </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000">Erudites</font> (High Men).</font><font size="3">
    This variant of humanity values their intellect over their brawn, and have attained great
    status with magical ability. Founded by their leader, Erud, they originally settled the
    island of Odus, and pride themselves on their social and mental abilties.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Woodland Elves</font><font size="3">.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    Feir'Dal. These elves are forest dwellers, with their home of Kelethin high in the trees,
    and have more pointed features than humans, including pointed ears. Their intellect
    matches that of a High Man, and their speed and nimble reflexes are superior to those of
    men. Their charms and comeliness are greater as well, but their physical strength and
    prowess is not as great as an average man.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000">High Elves</font><font size="3">. This is the noble
    variant of the elves, the most lordly, although the Dark Elves would challenge their
    &quot;royalty.&quot; As a more intellectual race of elves, they are thinner, paler, and
    more attractive than their woodland cousins. They can be found on their continent of
    Faydwer, in the palatial, marble city of Felwithe.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000">Dark Elves</font>. </font><font size="3">The
    Teir'Dal. This race is the master of the undercaverns, where they can see perfectly well
    in normal darkness. Their race is devoted to evil gods, and they plot their vile schemes
    from their home city of Neriak. Their hair is stark white, while their skin is bluish
    black.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Half-Elves</font><font size="3">. This is the union of a
    Human and an Elf, having some of the characteristics of both parents. Their features are
    slightly pointed, but less than a true Elf's.&nbsp; Their home city of origin is chosen at
    character creation by the choice of deity, which would seemingly indicate which of their
    parents they were raised with, at least on a cultural level (e.g., Freeport or Qeynos for
    the humans, Felwithe or Kelethin for the Elves).</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Dwarves</font><font size="3">. An extremely hardy and
    also short race, the dwarf prides himself on his beard or moustache. They are also quite
    agile, and skilled.&nbsp; Their stoic and proud city of Kaladim is a sight to behold, and
    their sharp axes and keen vision is the first greeting a visitor to the continent of
    Faydwer encounters. </font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000">Trolls</font>. </font><font size="3">This race
    averages around 8 feet in height, making small entrances and most beds out of the
    question! Their size is equalled in their strength, but their green skin is often smelly
    and unwashed. They are not the most hygeinic race on Norrath, nor are they extremely
    bright.&nbsp; Their stunted version of the common tongue is practically a sublanguage in
    itself, and the violent nature of this race is reflected by the fact that cannibalism is
    both accepted and at times encouraged.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Ogres</font><font size="3">. This is arguably the
    strongest race on Norrath, and equal to the Trolls in endurance. Their height averages 10
    feet, and their weight averages 400 pounds! They are, unfortunately, extremely stupid, and
    it is a cause for celebration if they remember to cook their food... Rallos Zek is
    credited with the creation of this powerful race.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000">Halflings</font>. </font><font size="3">They are a
    rather new race, like Humans, but are shorter than men. They are quick, agile, and stocky,
    being first encountered in their home of Rivervale. They love a good meal and good
    conversation, and their nimble natures have given them a natural advantage in their
    adventuring careers.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Gnomes</font><font size="3">. This race spends most of
    its time underground in their home city of Ak'Anon, where they have intricate homes. They
    are much like the Dwarves, but their skin is more of a brown hue, and their heads are
    sparsely covered with white hair.&nbsp; The most unique nature of these crafty,
    intelligent peoples is their affinity for their clockwork items, which are both their
    servants and creations.</font></li>
</ul>
