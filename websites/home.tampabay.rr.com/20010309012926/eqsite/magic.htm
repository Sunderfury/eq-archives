<hr>

<p>Many other sites focus on lists of spells and other spoilers regarding EQ's magic
system, which has never been my intention.&nbsp; You will learn plenty on your own; that
is one of the greatest aspects of the game.</p>

<p>There are four schools of magic, which the evil Miragul studied incognito before
becoming a lich. There are reagents for the more powerful spells, and the costs of
spellcraft are proportional to the level achieved. 

<ul>
  <li><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Necromancy</strong></em></font> </font><font
    size="3">the art of dealing with the dead. Speaking with spirits, stealing life from
    healthy opponents, and the animation and command of undead armies can be found within this
    school. It is studied by the Necromancer and the Shadow Knight.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Wizardry</strong></em></font><font size="3">
    the art of raw magical power. It is the domain of those who wish instantaneous travel, the
    ability to scry over long distances, and can produce the most lethal and spectacular
    magical effects. This art has no rival in evoking directly damaging magic.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Sorcery</strong></em></font><font size="3">.
    This is the art of summoning, bringing both servants and items to the caster to do his
    bidding. The strength of will necessary to command this form of magic ensures that its
    practitioners have the aptitude to even bring forth the living entities of the natural
    world known as the Elementals.</font></li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Enchantment</strong></em></font><font
    size="3">. This is both the art of charming and enchanting other beings, as well as the
    art of magically enhancing items and weapons. With this art, one could charm a person into
    fighting for the caster, or one could add a dweomer to the aura of a broadsword, granting
    it a better chance of hitting. </font></li>
</ul>

<p>There is arguably another school of magic, that of the magic granted through prayer and
dutiful worship of a Deity. Clerics and Paladins eximplify this variety of magic.<br>
