<hr>

<p align="center">Pale waxing light streaming through to illuminate the symbols,<br>
Reminding me I&#146;ve spent another night awake in my chambers<br>
Secretly coveting the words of the Goddess Erollisi Marr<br>
While balancing my duty to my creator, my patron Tunare.</p>

<p align="center">Silently striding past marble pillars, over marbled floors<br>
To replace the tome of Erollisi before the morning rites<br>
While the other initiates break the slumber of night,<br>
Back now, protected by Tunare&#146;s double-handed swords.</p>

<p align="center">The searing pride wells during the training,<br>
Mock combats and meditative prayer, focusing,<br>
But still the memory evokes, following me along,<br>
Her spry, sylvan smile as she breathes life to her song.</p>

<p align="center">Suppressing a smile as I concentrate<br>
Yet still I am haunted by that lovely face<br>
Those eyes that captured my duty-bound heart<br>
Spinning the melodies of Kelethin&#146;s art.</p>

<p align="center">Days pass onwards, studious tutelage<br>
Absorbing the wisdom of Tynkale&#146;s words,<br>
Balancing lunges with heavy worn swords,<br>
Meditating for wisdom, serene rites of passage.</p>

<p align="center">Running the missions, proving my worth,<br>
Tempering my mettle with love-stricken words,<br>
Dropping the gauntlet on our Orcish foes,<br>
Whose torturous fangs add to our woes.</p>

<p align="center">Trying to honor Lord Jael&#146;s commands,<br>
While pushing back the vision of Orcish cruelty,<br>
The rended flesh of proud Elven fealty,<br>
Displayed horridly near Orc-claimed lands.</p>

<p align="center">The path of Tunare&#146;s chosen winds onward,<br>
Swearing my oaths through prayer and action<br>
While sharing my growth, my satisfaction<br>
With the lovely bard, my sensuous ward.</p>
