<hr>

<p align="center"><em>The Beta Test Applications was available Friday the 13th of March
until October 28th, 1998.</em></p>

<p align="left"><big>Currently (October 28th):</big></p>

<p align="left">The beta test application has been removed, because, as 989 Studios put
it, they have received enough applications.&nbsp; As of October 28th, they are about to
email everyone who &quot;correctly&quot; filled out their beta application with
information regarding Phase 4, which will begin in early December and will require a small
fee.&nbsp; It will NOT be subject to the Non-Disclosure Agreement.&nbsp; They are also
about to begin Phase 3, which will start in early November, with the NDA, for about 5,000
lucky participants.</p>

<p align="center"><em>WHAT WAS: <a href="http://www.everquest.com/beta_form1.htm">http://www.everquest.com/beta_form1.htm</a></em></p>

<p><big>Previously:</big></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_top">official EQ Site</a> states that
in &quot;early March&quot; the application for beta testing will be available from their
site. In a generous move, they will allow <em>ANYONE</em> who fills out an application
form to participate in at least the final portion of the Closed Beta, before the open beta
begins.</p>

<p>They will be conducting the testing process in stages, and plan to allow more
&quot;external testers&quot; with each new stage. They are going to be very picky at
first, and I for one don't expect to be involved until the later portions. They are
looking for previous beta testing experience, MUD (multi- user dungeon) experience, and
other online and traditional gaming experience.</p>
