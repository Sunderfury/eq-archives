<p>Yes, I know this site is very ancient and dusty.&nbsp; I have breathed some new life
into it, and have decided to put up a faster mirror site.&nbsp; And I am AMAZED that the
big day is finally here.&nbsp; So many things have changed in my Real Life (tm); I am
happy to be with Debbie (Aeriana), as we game side-by-side, and I am happy to be a guild
member of the StormWolves and the F'luers DuMal.&nbsp; So many things in the last days of
the beta test made me say &quot;my God!&quot; as I gazed at the happenings in awe.&nbsp; I
brought down 3 inkies before I was murdered by cowardly skeletons and elementals while
battling the Innoruuk and his horde.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing you all in-game.

<p>The beta application is no longer available.&nbsp; 989 Studios has received enough
applicants.&nbsp; GOOD NEWS:&nbsp; Everyone who filled out the beta app.
&quot;correctly&quot; will get an email in the next few days about Phase 4, which will
start in early December, without the Non-Disclosure Agreement.&nbsp; Phase 3 is about to
begin, in early November, with the NDA still applicable to the lucky 5,000 participants.</p>

<p>There has been <em>so</em> much good news re: EQ... :)&nbsp; For starters, there was
the tremendously successful E3 showing, and now you can read the exemplary editorial at <a

&nbsp; *whew that's a mouthful*&nbsp; heh... There's been some controversy re: EQ vs. AC,
but then again, if you're looking for AC info, you're in the wrong place.&nbsp; </p>

<p><font size="3">Well,&nbsp; once again I've been lax in my updates.&nbsp; Sorry. &nbsp;
On a good note, though, <a href="http://www.eqx.simplenet.com" target="_top">EverQuest
Express</a> has published a story of mine entitled &quot;A Long Day,&quot; in issue
#22.&nbsp; Check it out!&nbsp; Brad has hinted in a very unofficial way in a recent chat
on #everquest that the beta may have already started. &nbsp; I know that the EQ staff is
doing internal testing, so let's just hope that we will all be in soon!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Sorry for the lack of updates. I had been working with IPASpro, as you
can see by his site <a href="http://www.ipaspro.com" target="_new">http://www.ipaspro.com</a>,and
then I started a new job at the university, and now I have bronchitis and sinusitis, ugh.
Anyway, there has been A LOT of great new stuff... just go to the newly redesigned <a
href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_new">EverQuest</a> site, with a great new layout
and tons of more info. I will be updating my pages as I get a chance. New deities, skill
listings, 26 new screenshots, and much more. <br>
<br>
The applications for the first part of the closed beta are finished, too, as of the 10th
of April.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As we all know, the Beta Apps will be on Friday the 13th, right? Sorta.
There is a way to jump the gun ;) On this Thursday, March 12th, there will be an early
Beta signup at the <a href="http://www.games.net" target="_new">Games.net</a> site.
Apparently, Sony will gurarantee that 250 of the applicants at the Games.net site will be
accepted. Don't worry about overlap if you apply via the normal route, though, because a <a
href="http://eqvault.questgate.net/com/eqdevboard/messages/773.html" target="_new">recent
post</a> by Brad McQuaid states they will be filtering out duplicate applications. </font></p>

<p>Also, the early apps will be available on Thursday from another site, <a
href="http://www.3dfx.ops" target="_new">3dfx.ops</a>!</p>

<p><font size="3">The new &quot;Top Ten&quot; is posted at the <a
href="http://eqvault.questgate.net/features/top10.htm" target="_new">EQ Vault</a>, dealing
with the rejected classes and races :)~ Funny stuff, plus I submitted both Number Ones on
each list! </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Beta Test Applications will be available on Friday the 13th of March
at the <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_new">Official EQ Site!</a> Remember,
the staff will be picky at first, but will allow everyone who fills out an application to
at the minimum take part in the final portion of the closed beta. Thanks Jerry, for
pointing that out!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The monthly chat with the EQ Team went over decently, apparently. Among
the topics illuminated by Mr. McQuaid are that aerial combat will not be a part of the
game, houses and boats owned by players witll be <em>extremely</em> rare, Ogres will be
able to body slam foes and smash down doors, the worship of your deity will influence
gameplay, and there is some seriously modern code being used to reduce lag. On the subject
of lag, there was another mention of the number of players per server being limited to
around 1000, thus reducing lag even further!</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The monthly chat is IRC based, and takes place on Efnet, in channel
#Everquest. I believe that there is also a newer #EQ channel, as well as an IRC based game
inspired by EQ! </font></p>
