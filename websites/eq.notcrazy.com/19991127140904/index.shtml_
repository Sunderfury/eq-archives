Mana Calculator

Okay, this is the last post for the moment, its 2:00pm, time to go get myself a turkey breakfast.
<P><blockquote><font color="#ECD278" size="-1">
This is a simple mana calculator which lets you calculate your mana, be it on an INT or WIS base calculation, without having to do anything special. The calculator will also display mana for every level from 1 to 50, and depending if your character is a pure caster, or a hybrid class, you will get the appropriate results.

<p>Ok...please visite my site at <a href="http://www.vianet.on.ca/pages/sf/index.htm" target="_new">http://www.vianet.on.ca/pages/sf/index.htm</a> You will see that in the left navigation pane, I've just added a files section. Inside the files section, my mana calc is ready for download :) Thank you so much.

Brad on Server Overcrowding

Brad "Whats' Wrong With Granola?" McQuaid responded to a rather <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/eq-expansion/Forum1/HTML/001101.html" target="_new">lengthy post</a> regarding the overcrowding of servers and zones, to which he replied the following:

<P><blockquote><font color="#ECD278" size="-1">
I think there are two ways to look at crowding as it relates to the Expansion.
<p>First, I imagine, there will be a rush to Kunark, whether it be mid to higher level characters, or Iksar newbies. We are doing several things to try to be ready for this, the big one being that the Iksar home city has four exits, each leading to a different outdoor zone, each with newbie areas.

<p>But the really good news is that after the newness and rush to Kunark calms a bit, we're left with a world 25%+ bigger. Once people spread out, I think the crowding some people complain about will be addressed in a big way.

Quellious: Multiple Events

</B></I></font><BR>

<font size="-3" color="#F5FFFA" face="verdana">Friday,  November 26 14:0:3 PST -- <a href="mailto:arrmihardies@notcrazy.com">Arr MiHardies</a></font><P>		

<font size="2" face="verdana">

This is a long post, looks to be a successful event.
<P><blockquote><font color="#ECD278" size="-1">
When: Saturday, December 4th, 1999, 1:00 pm eastern standard time, lasting three or more hours. 
<br>Where: East Commonlands - near zone to West Freeport. 
<br>How Do I Get There?: You can enter the zone either through West Freeport, West Commonlands, North Ro, or Nektulos Forest.
<br>Sponsored by: Dragon's Bane Guild on the Quellious Server 

<p>Planned events will be multizonal and will include: 
<br>*Free buffs and binds for all! 
<br>*Free food and beverages for all! 

<p>To celebrate the arrival of the Christmastide season, Dragon's Bane Guild will be hosting several merry events to bring cheer and bounty to all. These will include: 

<p>Newbie Giveways 
<br>Dragon's Bane members will be circulating with gifts for newbies, levels 8 and under. Prizes given away included Bronze and Blackened Armour, Fine Steel Weapons, Magic Jewelry and lots of other stuff! 

<p>Greater Faydark Trivia 
<br>This event will be going on during the entire festival. It is open to all classes and races. At different times during the festival, questions about Greater Faydark and it's surrounding areas, will be asked and the first person to answer will win a prize for answering that particular question. Questions will cover things such as names of shop owners, different locals in Greater Faydark, etc. 15 to 20 trivia questions will be asked during the festival, so there will be plenty of chances for you to win a prize. 

<p>Find the Dragon 
<br>One of the members of Dragon's Bane will be hiding in East Commons or any of the neighboring zones (West Commons, North Ro, West Freeport, Nektulos Forest). Whoever is lucky enough to find this person wins! The prize for winning this event is 200pp! 

<p>Rafflebane! 
<br>During the course of the festival we will occasionally draw a random name out of the people in the zone and award the name we draw with a random item. Names will be drawn from a pool of people that can use the item. 

<p>Dragon's Bane Salute to Nature 
<br>A prize to whomever can turn in the most foraged food at the end of the evening, when contest is announced complete. All foraged food becomes prize material for another competition. 

<p>Newbie Quests 
<br>Quests to assist newbies and get them started off on thier adventuring lives on the right foot. These quests will reward players with needed equipment for the players' level (ie, armour, weapons, Jewellry, and other items). Special Quests for each level group (1-4, 5-7, 9-12) will include items that newbies crave. 

<p>Spirit of the Dragon Olympics 
<br>2 groups must compete, a member of each group races from the Shop with the Cleric Trainer in East Commons to the Obelisk with rangers in East Commons, baton wielded. Each must pass the weapon to a team-mate who races back to the other Shop. Group members must remain at entrances when not racing. Prizes awarded to members of the winning team! 

<p>Dragon Camp Invasion 
<br>It's time for the camps of Dervish Cutthroats and Orcs to be shown the wrath of the mighty dragons! After the start time of this event is initiated, a full set of banded armour will be awarded to the players that bring back the most specified items to Ettore. What the specified items will be will be announced at the Festival. 

<p>Catch the Pickpocket 
<br>A nasty rogue plans to pickpocket an unsuspecting victim, which leads to a battle ending in murder! This will take place during the festival! If you can track the murderer down to his hiding place and /tell the Dragon's Bane representative with his /loc coordinates, we can bring this rogue to justice! Whoever gives the tip off gets 50 plat for their efforts... just watch for murder to take place. 

<p>DRAGON SLAVE AUCTION - Final Event 
<BR>Following the preceeding events, at about 4PM EST we will conduct Dragon's Bane player Slave Auction. Take home a high level slave at the end of the day! 

<p>That's right, we'll be auctioning off higher level players to lower level players. You must be under 20 to bid for your higher level slave! Need a personal cleric, tour guide, information source, whatever they want to use them for within reason. They will probably not attack a Sand Giant for you. There will be a mulitude of players of various levels availible for "Auction." Could you use a 35th level druid for two hours? The winner of each player will buy the right to have him/her as their "Servant" for 2 hours, (real time). 

<p>Come one, come all and celebrate the beginning of the holiday season with the Dragon's Bane Guild! More information can be obtained at <a href="http://www.davalkyries.com/db/eq.html" target="_new">http://www.davalkyries.com/db/eq.html</a> (Check under Events).

Solusek Ro: Aviaks Retaliation

</B></I></font><BR>

I just love how characters can run almost exactly, but not quite, fast enough to escape their pursurers.
<P><blockquote><font color="#ECD278" size="-1">
As on the Karanas server, on the Solusek server two aviaks, an AviakAssassin and an Assassin Tauk were sighted in South Karana.. At word of this, Scarab, mustering over 20 members, rushed to aid in the slaughter, as humans were being attacked by the birds... when Tauk was questioned, he simply said "All non-feathers must die!" and proceeded to stab at my backside

<br>Courtesy of Cloudx, Knight of Scarab

<p>The birds were lightning quick, and were nearly faster than bards running at full blast (nearly, bwahaha)... they backstabbed for nearly 150 with one (Tauk was carrying a spear.. and he vanished... *sigh*) and possibly poisoned...

<p>After several attempts to gather this aviak, he finally stood and fought.. supported by a massive showing of Scarab and others they were downed by a band of friends.

<p>This assassin carried a few trinkets, and dropped three things:
<br>A Serrated Bone Dirk (Congrats Atlus)
<br>An Enchanted Fine Steel Rapier (Congrats Kitsu)
<br>And a Swirlspine Belt (Congrats Cloudx!)

Brad on spawn times and Kithicor

</B></I></font><BR>

<font size="-3" color="#F5FFFA" face="verdana">Thursday,  November 25 22:38:21 PST -- <a href="mailto:catalyst@notcrazy.com">Catalyst</a></font><P>		

<font size="2" face="verdana">

Brad "I know where my towel is at!" McQuaid made two posts on the news group alt.games.everquest today. One about the changes to Kithicor, and the other about the tweaks they have made to zones, and spawning times, as well as what some of the EQ team is working on now. Brad's remarks are in Bold:
<P><blockquote><font color="#ECD278" size="-1">
And I have to agree with the people who are complaining about it, the change is nonsense.<P>

 I went through a few times immediately after the change, actually, and didn't see ANYTHING, but I believe it was because the zone was actually crowded with high level folks at the time (I never did a who to find out, I'm just assuming). However, this time, to play it safe, I decided to head through in broad daylight. Didn't matter. Almost through, and two zombie troopers and a dreaded wolf assault me. Little 20th level me.<P>

 I BARELY made it to the zone alive, and I nearly died from the troopers DOT spells on the other side.<P>

 Bad design decision for several reasons:<P>

 Kithicor is a funnel. The way to get more people into it was NOT by making a bunch of uber mobs for people to hunt, but placing interesting quests and locales in it (ala the tiger quest). It's a funnel for practically EVERY halfling that wants to go ANYWHERE (as the Gorge was a death trap and a half) other than Misty Thicket, as well as mid level folks (like myself) who want to go from High Hold to Freeport, or mid levels who want to go from Freeport to Qeynos (or High Hold). It's a transit point, and until recently, a very well used one.<P>

 The MOBs in their currently make the Hill Giants and Griffins of the East Commonlands (which I never had a problem with, personally) seem like a cakewalk...because you could see them. In Kithicor, due to the mist, by the time you see a MOB, you're in it's aggro range.<P>

 I heard someone mention that a Guide had spoken with them about it and had agreed that it was overdone, and that something was being done about it...here's hoping that's true.<P>

<B>We're going to make it only dangerous like that at night.</B><P>

<hr width="65%" align="center"><P>

What is the deal with this?<P>

 Everfrost, formerly the best place to hit level 18 now runs out of mobs at level 14.  This appears to be a clear example of Verant nerfing spawn rates to prolong the time taken to level.  This is so shortsighted as to be flabberghasting.<P>

 Hey, McQuaid, the HORSE HAS BOLTED.  There is no point shutting the stable door now, all the Powerlevellers have hit 50 and either given up already or started a new character (and in the case of the latter why nerf their level progression when they demonstrate they will play on but with a different class).<P>

 The only people that this is *really* hurting are new players.  Wouldn't you *hate* to be starting your first character today with nerfed spawns and no twinking gear to make up for that (by hitting harder mobs)<P>

<B>We haven't touched spawn rates there, and we are not across the board messing with spawn rates -- there's no reason to.  I can only speculate that perhaps there are more players in the region now, killing more things, making it appear there is less to kill.<P>
 
The only areas that come to mind that we changed recently were Kithicor and the area outside of Paw, and Paw itself.  The team is working on populating and tuning the Plane of Sky now, not engaging in a secret conspiracy to reduce spawning rates.<P>
 
In fact, I can't recall since launch any negative change to the general spawning rate of a zone.  Sure, we've lowered the spawning rate of specific NPCs (usually named ones, ones involved with quests and such), but not to an entire zone.<P>
 
There is also, btw, no general conspiracy to slow the powergamers down.  When they or anyone else find an aspect of the game that allows progression at a significantly higher rate than was planned, then yes we definitely try to address that.  When they or anyone else finds a method of defeating a region or NPC or set of NPCs that is contrary to how difficult that process was intended to be, yes we definitely try to address that.  But, contrary to what some believe, we are not 'terrified' at the general rate at which powergamers (or anyone else) progress in EQ and we rarely if ever make sweeping, global changes to the game to slow them down, thereby negatively and unfairly penalizing the average or casual gamer.<P>
 
Lowering the spawn rates of entire zones would be a sweeping change. Addressing specific tactics and/or aspects of the game clearly not balanced with the rest, like cherry picking NPCs with impunity, kiting, unresistable lifetaps, etc., are changes that unfortunately are sometimes necessary to keep advancement rates fairly constant across the board.  Balance is the key word here.<P>
 
The game as a whole has only become easier since release.  Positive changes we have made, for example halving the experience loss death penalty, combined with the increased knowledge players have, the help other players get from higher level players, and the deflation that has naturally occurred in the economy which makes more powerful items more obtainable to lower level players, only make the game easier.<P>
 
In summary, we are very happy with the general rate at which players are advancing (most players are around levels 20-25, right where we expected them to be) and only when we see a specific aspect of advancing (amidst the myriad of ways and places you can advance in this game) that is out of sync with the majority do we take action.<P>

Fennin Ro: Bazaar

</B></I></font><BR>

<font size="-3" color="#F5FFFA" face="verdana">Thursday,  November 25 11:55:49 PST -- <a href="mailto:catalyst@notcrazy.com">Catalyst</a></font><P>		

<font size="2" face="verdana">

This from Clron Stormwielder, sounds like an interesting Bazaar/Raffle/Treasure hunt:
<P><blockquote><font color="#ECD278" size="-1">
Hello fellow citizens of Norrath.<P>

My name is Clron Stormwielder, myself and Thynfiula are the managers for the new weekly Fennin Ro Bazaar as some might already know. The following pieces of information are now 100% certain and will happen at the first Bazaar this Saturday at the East Commons/North Ro Cave, East Commons side.<P>

The Bazaar will be held EVERY Saturday, like the ones on many other severs, and may start and end at any time, however, the official beginning of the Bazaar is 10a.m. EST and ending is 3P.M. EST.<P>

HOWEVER, special Bazaars will have there own time and will be announced. The Thanksgiving Bazaar will go from 10 a.m. EST till 5:30 P.M. EST. But people may stay as long as they like.<P>

Two special events will be held:<P>

1: A raffle will occur, tickets are 8pp per ticket and the picking is totally random. The raffle is as follows: Grand Prize Winner: Receives 40% of the raffle money. (no sodality members may win this)<P>

Second Prize Winners: 10% of the money will go to a certain amount of people depending on how much is collected and how much each winner will receive.(sodality may win this, but I assure everyone this is NOT rigged.) The remaining 50% of the money will go towards the special Christmas Bazaar, and money from the Christmas and the Thanksgiving Bazaar will go towards a gigantic Millennium Bazaar.<P>

2: A treasure hunt:<P>

At 12 noon on Saturday (the day of the Bazaar) people may enter the treasure hunt. Each class must pay a reasonable amount of money for there level. Each level section will be required to get different items, but we ask people of higher levels to not help out some of the newbies in there hunt as it would be extremely easy for many. At 12 noon you may enter the Treasure Hunt, and unless notified, we will stop taking entries at about 12:15-12:30. After all entries are in the required items will be announced. PLEASE NOTE: Only myself and Thynfiula know the items and NO ONE ELSE does and it will stay that way until all entries are in. At 5:00p.m. We are asking ALL participants to come back to the cave. at 5:15p.m. ALL participants MUST be back at the East Commons unless otherwise notified. PLEASE NOTE: this will only be done if a particular level range has not yet completed the treasure hunt. At 5:20 all participants will be ask how many items they have gotten, and the winners will be announced. <P>

IF there is more then one winner they will receive an equal amount of money (rounding down if necessary). The winner will get 75% of the total money earned. The person/people who come in second place will receive 5% of the money earned. And the remainder will go towards funding other activates.<P>

There may also be other this implemented in the Bazaar, and on Friday all information on the Bazaar will be released.<P>

(PLEASE NOTE: All time is based in Eastern Standard Time) If you have ANY questions about he Bazaar I will be happy to answer them BUT DO NOT ask me what the treasure hunt items are! <P>

(Fennin Ro Bazaar Director)

Thanksgiving edition of Dear Mynx

</B></I></font><BR>

<font size="-3" color="#F5FFFA" face="verdana">Thursday,  November 25 11:51:54 PST -- <a href="mailto:catalyst@notcrazy.com">Catalyst</a></font><P>		

<font size="2" face="verdana">

A brand spankin' <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/mynx/mynxnov2599.shtm">new issue of Dear Mynx</a> has been posted just in time for Thanksgiving. Today Mynx deals with 'Performance Killers', average size of your wild turkey, the whole Age thing, and quite a bit more. Head on over to the page and read all about it:
<P><blockquote><font color="#ECD278" size="-1">
I'm a 19 year old college student, and the a couple weeks ago I met a girl at a party who was really cool.  I seemed to hit it off very well with her, and we talked for awhile.  When she left to go do something, one of my friends who knew her walked over to me and broke the news.<P>

"She's 14."<P>

Well, we all had a good laugh at my expense and I went on with my life, but the next week she came out with us again and we hit it off once again.  I really like the fact that she hasn't been influenced by the whole 'party girl' scene that most of the girls my age are into now.  My question is: in your humble opinion, do you think it's all right for me to see a 14 year old??  It seems really weird to me, but I just can't get over how well we seem to go together.  I am very confused.
