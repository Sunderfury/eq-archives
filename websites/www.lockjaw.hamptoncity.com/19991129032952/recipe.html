		<P ALIGN="left">The purpose of this page is to provide a database of
		  known recipies that DO NOT work. By eliminating duplication of effort, one can
		  reasonably assume that in time the recipe will be found. Only recipies that DO
		  NOT work will be posted here. Extra rows are provided so that this list can be
		  printed offline and filled in as you are actually trying out recipies.</P> 
		<P ALIGN="left">If you have other information or recipies that you have
		  tried PLEASE email them to me at the address below, together we CAN solve this
		  mystery!</P> 
		<P ALIGN="left">Thank You</P>

		<P ALIGN="left">UPDATE - Rooke, a Dwarven Cleric sent in an email
		  suggesting that metal twine is probably not good for fishing poles, but I'm not
		  familiar with the different types of string in the game. Any and all
		  information about any kind of string that exists in the game would help a
		  LOT.</P> 
		<P ALIGN="left">NOTE - Multiple XXX's in a square indicate multiple
		  occurances of the item in the recipe.<BR> NOTE - I want to make sure anyone who
		  contributes gets full credit for their work, so if you have contributed to this
		  list, please email me so I can put it up here.</P> 
		<P ALIGN="left">8/14/99 - Added more failed recipes. <BR> 8/15/99 - Added
		  LOTS more failed recipes from the EQ_tinkering one-list.<BR> 8/15/99 - Lots of
		  good tinkering information, including the tinkering one list, can be found at
		  that this web site:<BR> <A HREF="http://www.eqportal.com/Tinkering/">Tinkering
		  Trade Site </A><BR> 8/17/99 - Added LOTS more failed attempts (Have list of
		  contributors, but will update that tommorow)</P> 
		<P ALIGN="left">&nbsp; </P> 
		<P ALIGN="left">Analysis 8/14/99 - A lot of work has been done with a
		  fishing pole in the recipie, my intuitive feeling is that the recipie is
		  something along the lines of 1ROD, 2 SHAFTS, GREASE and some sort of string.
		  Maybe metal twine, maybe fletching twine, its even been suggested that spider
		  silk and other things could be used as twine.<BR> </P> 
		<P ALIGN="left">Analysis 8/17/99 - Lots more recipes in. I think we can
		  conclude that a fishing pole is not part of the recipe, my inner suspicions
		  that it is along the lines of multiple shafts, some kind of string and maybe
		  grease. I would recommend anyone just getting started with the pole project to
		  explore multiple shaft combos, with twine that you get from fletcher merchants
		  and raw bamboo from regular merchants. If you think about it, a pole would be a
		  series of shafts, each with slightly smaller diameters that would fit inside
		  one another.</P> 
		<P ALIGN="left">9/2/99 - Database is now available in excel format,
		  <A HREF="download/recipe.xls">click here to download it</A>. It is saved in
		  windows 95 excel format, a fairly old format, so it should be compatible with
		  most versions of excel. Here is a <A HREF="download/recipe.txt">text tab
		  deliminated</A> file if the excel file doesn't work. <B><FONT
		  COLOR="#660033">*NOTE* You may have to shift-click on the link to download

		<P ALIGN="left">9/5/99 - Here is a <A HREF="download/recipe.zip">zipped
		  file</A> that contains both the excel format and text tab deliminated format of
		  the files. It should download normally</P> 
		<P ALIGN="left">9/6/99 - Added more recipes and updated the excel
		  files.</P>
		<P ALIGN="left">10/10/99 Thanks to anonymous of Cazic Thule, and friend,
		  whoever you are, you are the nicest coolest person ever! Anyways, thanks to
		  this person the third book of Gimbelston is online, and there is no longer any
		  need to have this database online. The recipie for the collapsable pole is 3
		  poles and 1 gnomish bolts. Trivial at skill 50.</P>
		<P ALIGN="left">Once again, MAJOR thanks to all those who emailed me, who
		  looked and poked about and who never gave up! You all are the best!<B><FONT
