              on this weekend. With it being St. Patrick's day weekend, we're 
              a bit short of the classes needed to do some serious raiding (Fucking 
              clerics, POSERS! All of you.) We hit up the two biggest gimps of 
              VP last night, Silverpuss and Dykegoz for some quick and easy loot.<br>

              That mother fucking cock whore dumb fuck Dykegoz dropped two of

              You see, I'm that much cooler now that I just cussed over twenty 
              times in one paragraph. For those of you who DON'T understand, and 
              continue to post in the name of god on EQVault and the EQForums, 
              this is entertainment. If you don't like it, peace the fuck out 
              because you're wasting my bandwith. And even though Mr. T did hack 
              us, I'm going to leave his update because I'm too lazy to rewrite 
              that. No real screen shots from today other than myself giving Nene 
              a hard time about getting her epic. <font color="#FF0000">Congratulations

              20,000+ hits a week. MADNESS! Post something on the board too with 
              what you'd like to see on the page, what would make Triton's site 
              even MORE enjoyable than it is now? Want more screen shots? More

              believe that Triton as a guild is nothing more than a bunch of immature 
              thirteen year old kids running around getting off on the fact that 
              we know how to swear. The first post can be found on Whineplay at

              </a>Here I'm being degraded as the thirteen year old boy I truly 
              am. The second is from a Christian fellow on the EQVault message 
              board, the post can be found <a href="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=9929607&start=9930726">here</a>. 
              I'm going to take this moment to sum up how we as a guild feel about 
              the judgmental and presumptuous attitude shown by these ignorant 
              heathens. If you DON'T find the humor in our web site, then don't 
              fucking READ it. Further, if you don't like it but find yourself 
              still reading it, then you my friend are a victim of the code. In 
              conclusion I have this to say to the politically correct, sexist, 
              racist homophobes.</font></b></p>

              on to our update for the day. With the Planes being upgraded, we 
              pulled a 5545X plan. Disregard the raid schedule and go tear the 
              shit out of hate. We haven't had this much fun in a long time. The 
              second floor of hate is the way hate should have been designed from 
              the beginning, urban combat. The mobs are a complete bitch to pull, 
              many will not move. The solution is to literally walk through hate 
              with your raiding party going house to house and taking out everything. 
              So a round of applause for whichever designer is responsible for 
              this zone.</font></b></p>

              sure did learn the true meaning of hate, giving three runs at the 
              mother fucker. We had him to 0% health, as in no red life left. 
              However, his regeneration was just too much for the small amount 
              of remaining people left. I won't get in to details but the new

              We picked up some damn nice loot off the second floor. Unfortunately 
              Triton members ninja loot the shit faster than I can take pictures 
              of it, so I'm forced to use outside screen shots again! Thx you 
              loot hungry mofos, go back to Russia. Honorhawk and Summers both 
              picked up a Darkmetal Falchion which is one hand slashing <i><font color="#FF0000">23

              boots and vambraces of Righteous. No fucking idea on the stats on

              Now for your challenge I promised everyone. Your mission, should 
              you choose to accept, is to make a character on Povar and piss off 
              a Triton member so much that they tell you to FUCK OFF AND DIE,

              mis amigos! Qu&eacute; una semana de fucking. Err oops still speaking 
              spanish. Well 5 nights of non stop partying, over 500 beers consumed, 
              and a friend with Herpes from fucking a Mexican whore, I am back 
              my friends. Let's just take a moment to envy the fucking blast I 
              had while you chumps were at home playing EQ, Suckas. Get out of

              <br>
              My first night back in business started with Krellyk issuing out 
              a warrent for the immediate death of Gonorrhea for twenty two charges 
              of Dragocular Manslaughter (Whatever the FUCK that is.) We gathered 
              at our usual fight spot, note NOT FUCKING KARNORS for all you fucking 
              bitch as EQVault flamers. Within 30 minutes the bitch was pulled 
              and the fight began. Never in my life have I seen such pure ownage 
              of a mob. We took Gornaire down with<font color="#FF0000"> 0</font> 
              deaths, that's right, <font color="#FF0000">0</font> deaths. Pure 
              fucking ownage. She dropped *EASIER* than Root does to his knees 
              when Zaar asks for his monthly blowjob. (Where the fuck have you 
              been Root?) Gornaire had this to say about her beat down.<br>

              Triton Elite Anti-Terrorist Strike Team, bringing the end of a rigorous 
              three month Triton Command investigation. The investigation began 
              when Triton recieved news that Zlandicar had filed restraining orders 
              against key triton officers, citing the accused were planning an 
              assult on the well being of himself. Triton immedialty filed an 
              appeal on grounds of loot deprevation. The 2nd appeals court granted 
              a temporary pause on the restraining orders, allowing for Triton 
              to mobilize and knock the fuck out of this bitch.</FONT></B></P>
