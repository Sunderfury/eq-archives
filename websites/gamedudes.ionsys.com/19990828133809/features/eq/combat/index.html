<blockquote>
<p>Combat in Everquest</p>
<p>While there are many things to do in EQ, you will spend far
more time fighting than anything else. So, its a good idea to know what the
heck youre doing. Dying is not fun; it costs you experience, and sometimes a
great deal of time trying to recover your corpse. </p>
<p>This section is devoted to two things. </p>
1.Keeping death to a minimum
<br>
2.Learning what, when, and how to fight
</p>
<p>Well start with the absolute basics, and work up. </p>
<p><b>The <i>Consider</i>Key</b></p>

<p>The first, and extremely important rule, is the command
/con, or <i>consider</i>. You use consider
by targetting your enemy, and pressing the key you have set to the consider
command (the default is c). What youre doing is simply a level comparison
EQ compares the level of the target with your level, and tells you what your
chances are. It also tells you the disposition of the target towards you
whether it likes you, or will attack you on sight. A typical /con response
would be like this: A jungle spiderling looks at you indifferently  looks
like you would have the upper hand</p>

<p>Heres how they break down.</p>

Early in the game, these are what you will see as the second
half of the consider message, the part that does the level comparison.
<br>
Looks like a reasonably safe opponent - This target is quite a
few levels beneath you. It most likely is not worth experience.You wont see anything green until at least
level 5.
<br>
Looks like you would have the upper hand
 - Target is at least 1 level below you, should be no problem to
kill.
<br>
Looks like an even fight  -
Target is the same level you are. Should be do-able, but will be close.
<br>
Looks like quite a gamble
 - Target is 1-2 levels above you. You will most likely lose
this fight if you are fighting solo.
<br>
What would you like your tombstone to say?
 - Target is 3 or more levels above you. Youre dead.
<br>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/uhoh.jpg" WIDTH=450 HEIGHT=338>
<br>
Umm can you say Run?
</center>
<br>
<br>
These messages do change to some degree as you gain levels,
such as three different blue consider responses; upper hand, risky, and
dangerous, to differentiate even more. At higher levels still, it returns to
only one blue /con response looks quite formidable.

<br>

The first half of the /con responses do not change
throughout the game, and break down like this.

<br><br>
Looks at you warmly  this is as good as it gets. The target
loves you.
<br>
Kindly considers you  the target likes you.
<br>
Regards you indifferently  The target neither likes or
dislikes you. It will not attack you unless you attack first.
<br>
Glowers at you dubiously  The target doesnt like you much,
but not to the point where it wants to kill you.
<br>
Scowls at you, ready to attack  The target wants to kick
your ass. Get too close, and youll be fighting.
<br>
Glares threateningly  The ultimate in hate. The target
wants to kill you and spit on your corpse.
<br>
<br>
(quick off-topic note. /con is useful even when youre
deciding which merchant to deal with when buying or selling. The more they like
you, the better prices theyll offer)
<br><br>
So if youre wandering along, and /con something that shows
as xxxx scowls at you, ready to attack  what would you like your tombstone to
say?, its time to head another direction.
<br><br>
Get in the habit of using consider like mad whenever youre
near mobs, /con them to make sure theres nothing out there that can turn you
into mincemeat. Consider is strictly solo-oriented; all its doing is comparing
your level to the targets level. It wont take into consideration if youre in
a group, your equipment, or anything else. Its strictly number vs number.
While a yellow may be too much for an adventurer to handle solo, in a group it
should be no problem whatsoever.



<h3>Simple Combat</h3>



<p>At early levels, combat is pretty straight forward. There
are just a few simple rules to make it go as smoothly as possible.</p>

<p> <b>Make sure any
special attacks and/or spells are easily accessible</b>. For fighter types,
this means making sure kick/slam/bash etc, are macrod so they are quick to
use. For spellcasters, it means making sure the right spells are memorized, and
knowing which icon is for what to be able to click on the right spell quickly.
You can also macro your spells to make them even easier to access. Macroing is
covered in the <i>getting started</i> section.
</p>

<p>#2 <b>Be careful youre
not biting off more than you can chew</b>. Some of the creatures out there help
others of their kind; swinging at one fire beetle with 3 others nearby will
turn into a fight with all 4 of them. Learn which creatures act this way, and
be sure to attack them alone.</p>

<p>#3 <b>Look around you</b>.
If youre fighting in a zone that has mobs in it that are deadly to you, make
sure you look around during combat to avoid surprises. The best way to do this
is by switching to a 3<sup>rd</sup> person view. </p>

<p>#4 <b>Know when to run</b>.
It does no good to turn and run for it when youre one hit away from death.
When a player is very badly injured, they move much slower than usual. Running
away at that point is virtually impossible. If you realize you cant win a
fight, run. Dont wait until its too late. </p>

<p>#5 <b>Time your spells.</b>
One thing any casting class learns pretty quickly is that spells can and will
be interrupted through getting hit by an enemy. The best time to start a cast
is immediately after the mob has taken a swing at you. Usually the spell will
cast before it takes another swing, meaning no chance of interruption.</p>

<p>#6 <b>Use your special
attacks</b>. Kicking, bashing, the monks special attacks, etc, mean the
difference between life and death in many battles. Use these attacks as often
as it will let you. </p>



<p>Follow these rules, and life will be easier. Always
remember; theres no shame in running away. The experience from any one
creature is nothing compared to the time and XP lost by dying. If you know
running is hopeless (long way from a zone, guard, etc), all you can do is stand
and fight. If you cant get away, dont try. </p>



<h3>Group Combat</h3>



<p>Most of the time in EQ is spent grouping with others to kill
bigger and badder mobs. There are a few things to remember in order for a group
to work together well. </p>



<p> <b>Know your role.</b>
This is the biggest cause of groups disbanding in disgust. Everyone wants to
hit the mob as much as they can, and do as much damage as possible.
Understandable? Yes. Bright? No. When a cleric spends all his mana nuking a
target, the fighters might get a bit upset when they die since theres nobody
left to heal them. This doesnt mean that healer types should never cast
offensive spells, they just need to be responsible about it. The first concern
of every member in a group should be looking out for their party. Fighters
should be taunting, keeping the mobs on them, and not on the weaker casters. A
badly damaged player should know when to step back out of the battle and get
some hitpoints back. Casters need to conserve their mana, using their spells
when and where they do the most good. A group of players who know how they can
be the most effective can take on creatures a less responsible group would get
killed by.</p>



<p>#2 <b>Communicate</b>.
There is nothing more frustrating to many players than having a group member
pull a mob when players are still injured, or the casters have low mana.
Before a big battle, make sure everyone is ready, and the casters are at full
mana. Otherwise its suicide. During combat, communication is just as
important. Casters tell the group when out of mana (OOM works well, and easy to
type or macro to a social). Ask for a heal if youre in trouble sometimes in
the heat of battle the healers might not notice as quickly as they should. Warn
the group if youre about to run; nothing is more annoying than having someone
turn and break for it without any warning whatsoever.</p>



<p>#3 <b>Dont Panic</b> If
you freak out, youre probably dead. Stay calm, and trust your group. If you
dont think you can rely on the people
youre partied with, its time to go elsewhere. One of the biggest instances I
see of this is when a low HP caster type (wizard, enchanter, magician,
necromancer) has the mob turn on them and start attacking. The first instinct
seems to be to run around madly, trying to avoid getting hit. In reality all
that does is make it almost impossible for any of the others in the group to
get swings in, and the fighters have almost no chance to taunt the target off
you. Stand still and trust your group the only reason to run around is if
youre going to run for the exit.</p>



<p>Good groups rock, bad groups are everywhere. If you find
players you trust and that you work well with, stick with them. Remember who
knows what theyre doing, and who doesnt. Group with the former, and do your
best to teach the latter. Many of the bad players in EQ are just new and
inexperienced players whove never had anyone point out what theyre doing
wrong. </p>



<h3>The Fun Factor</h3>



<p>In any game as huge as EQ, there are always going to be places
to fight that are easier and safer than others. Its very possible to level all
the way to 50 with very little danger, by always fighting in safe locations
against fairly weak mobs which very often ends up in camping the same location
for 5 levels or more.</p>

<p>However, one thing I have learned is a simple mathematical
equation. </p>

<h3>Danger = fun</h3>

<p>You can play it safe, killing creatures in easy locations (5
feet from a zone edge, right near a guard, etc), and wonder why EQ seems boring
and repetitive. Theres no question that this method will gain you levels
faster, and everyone will play this way at times. The only problem is playing
this way <b>all</b> the time. Yes, dying
sucks. But there is nothing more fun in this game than taking a group up
against a mob that is harder than youve ever fought before and winning. </p>

<p>Explore, check out new areas, take on creatures youve never
seen before. Play with people you like to hang with, and trust your back to.
Dont be afraid to take some chances, but dont be suicidal either, and
Everquest will be a blast. Weve been given a great world to adventure in, but
its up to you to make it fun.</p>
