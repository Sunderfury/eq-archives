<TR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the name 
                implies, Everquest is full of quests. However, as you will 
                experience in your adventures, most of the quests are either very unrewarding or in some  cases even broken. We have decided that our quest section should only include those quests which we have proven to work and  provide a decent reward. These are a few of the best of the static quests Everquest has to offer, and we will make  every attempt to keep it updated with the newly added quests.&nbsp; If you have a quest you found rewarding please feel free to share it with us.

			  <TD><FONT color=#0000ff><b>Glowing Stein Quest: </b> </FONT>
			  An excellent quest for low and high level players alike.  With a reward that, to my knowledge, is the highest INT based hand held item in the game(+10 INT +5 DEX +10HP +10 SV Disease).  The components for the quest can be collected by anyone, however to complete the quest you will need the assistance of a trustworthy level 20ish enchanter.  It is such an easy quest we expect Verant to "tweak"(break) it in the near future.  For now, however, the quest's details are as follows:
			  <br>
			  - The Ogre bartender in Ogguk, Clurg, wants his bartenders compendium and requests its return.<br>
			  - In Freeport bartender Gregor has the bartenders compendium but requests in trade the ingredients for his exotic drinks.  The requested ingredients are:  1. Kiola Nut (purchased on island of Erollisi), 2. Erud's Tonic (Buy Innoruk's Kiss of Death from Hawk's Inn in Erudin, deliver this to Sinnkin Highbrow, top floor of the library)  3. Honey Jum(Give 3 Honeycombs and 5gp to an NPC in "The Herb Jar" store in Rivervale)(Honeycombs are often found on Bixies)  4. Koalindl Fish(lake in Temple of Life in Qeynos, or on Frostbite the pet dog of the fishing camp in WK).
			  - Once the ingredients are fetched, an enchanter should cast benevolence and turn in the items to Gregor, he will reward with a few platinum and the bartenders compendium.<br>
			  - An Enchanter then takes the bartenders compendium to Ogguk and using illusion ogre, benevolence, and aliance gives the compendium to Clurg.  If he deems you "trustworthy" you will be the proud new owner of A Glowing Stein.

			  <TR><TD><FONT color=#0000ff><b>Avenger Battle Axe: </b> </FONT>
After returning the clockwork remains to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him about the Eye of Stormguard. He will give you a letter to give to the Jail clerk near the bank of High Pass keep.  Of course the prisoner has escaped but she does give you part of the eye of stormguard, as well as info that "Bronin" has the other part, the "Emerald Shard".  Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes found in Rivervale and sometimes near the southern tower in Misty Thicket.  When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he says he will give it to you if you do a small favor.  Apparently a bounty hunter by the name of Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body, he will give you the emerald.  Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket.  He appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)!  He hops around between the Orc camp and the wall.  You may have to talk to Bronin to get him to spawn.  If you defeat him, you get a frolock
leg (lore item), a few gold, and the following faction adjustments:  Frogloks of Kurnak gets Worse, Sarnak gets worse, Swamp Giants of Kurnak gets better, and Iskar gets better.  When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells you that he put the emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes, and gives you a key to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold.  The key is labeled H.K.106. Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and the following faction adjustments:  Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of River Vale gets worse.  When you turn in the key in highpass bank, you get the emerald shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience, and the following adjustments: Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson McCabe all get better.   Bronin also says "There is a [second Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will need it..."  Upon further questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the Gem of Tunare, and is
being held by a guild in Kelethin.  In Kelethin, go to the Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about the Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The only one who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting "at the lake near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to Dagnor's Cauldron and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his brother is a thief (and only his half brother btw) and that he has gone to Qeynos, probably to work for the thieves guild there.  Faldor Hendrys is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he can be found walking out the front gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills zone sometimes. You need to kill him to get the gem.   Combine the parts and you get the eye of stormguard, which gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection.   If you give it to Beno, he gives you a long speach about how wonderful a warrior you are and says he is giving you a "warrior's true weapon designed by the ancient 	
stormguard hero, Jendl Mizebrite."  He then will give you the Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice warrior only 2HS weapon.  It is likely that you need to have a very high faction with him to get the axe. (Submitted by Sheba, Erondil and Bertran Headbasher)

                <TD><FONT color=#0000ff><b>Playing Mailman:</b> </FONT>   This is a quest which covers most of Norrath.  You take on the role of a "mailman" and deliver either letters or mail pouches for the League of Antonican Bards.  The quest returns very little in the way of money (1gp to 9gp) but is an excellent way to quickly raise your bard factions.<br>

				 <FONT color=#0000ff><b>The Soulfire:</b> </FONT> (The X)
					<br><b>Step 1.</b> Go to Kalatrina Plossen (while you are under lvl 9) and ask her how to help the truthbearer. She gives you a note which you must take to Guard Alayle in the Militia House in West Freeport. When you give him the note he is immediately killed by the only guard in North Freeport, Krazen Loosh (The guy from the bank..remember him?) Before he dies he shoves a tattered flier in your hand.
					<br><b>Step 2.</b> Go to Kalatrina Plossen and give her the note...she tells you to talk to the head of the coalition of Freeport Tradesfolk which is also in North Freeport...that lady directs you to the owner of the forge...a little dwarf named Groflah Steadirt. 
					<br><b>Step 3.</b> After you watch Alayle die for the second time =) Go to Groflah's Forge in North Freeport and hand him your new tattered flier. He will get all nervous and tell you to meet him at the Seafarer's Roost in East Freeport...the bar at the docks. 
					<br><b>Step 4.</b> You will have to wait a long time for him to pop, but he pops to your left if your facing the bar. In the meantime...wait for a beggar named Tykar Renklin to pop right next to the bar. When he does...and here is the trick...HAIL HIM REPEATEDLY...this will keep in the zone long enougth to be useful. While you keep hailing him buy a Drom's Champagne from the bartender...it is a lore item so you have to do this one at a time. If you keep hailing him he should stick around long enough for you to give him 4 of these drinks. When you hand him the fourth...he gives you a blanket and tell you to give it to the only prisoner in the jails under the Arena. 
					<br><b>Step 5.</b> After Tykar pops, Groflah usually pops soon. When he is there...give him back the tattered flier. Once you do, he will give you the necessary information about the person who had the sword...the currently jailed (not dead like he says) Ariska Zimel!! He will also fill in the information on your flier. 
					<br><b>Step 6.</b> Go out and get a fire beetle eye and some rat ears...combine them in an oven to make edible goo, then combine some snake scales a water flask and a bottle in a brew barrel and you should get some bog juice (both may take several tries of you have no skill like I did). Take the blanket you just got and the juice and goo to the arena and go to the prisoner. Give the all three at once and he will give you a key called HK 105. 
					<br><b>Step 7.</b> He tells you to take it to the Cee-Lerk in Anteria's pass. Anteria is old elven for Antonica, and the only pass in Antonica is Highhold Pass. The Cee-Lerk is his distorted way of saying "clerk." Basically, give the HK 105 key to Bank Clerk Jaylin and she will give you a note. 
					<br><b>Step 8.</b> The note directs you to a man named Brother Hayle who happens to be a fellow knight of Marr. He is currently adventuring in the Dungeon of Splitpaw in the Karanas. (Easy Place at my lvl =) When you give him the note he tells you that you need to prove yourself by getting three items yourself. He demands the hilt of an unholy sword, a brilliant sword of faith and the testimony of truth from a paladin who lost favor with Mithaniel Marr and lost his powers. 
					<br><b>Step 9.</b> The first thing you need is the sword hilt. This is found on a Shadowknight named Xioctil in the Castle Mistmoore. He is not-super rare, but you need to keep the mobs there clear so he will spawn. He drops the hilt every time. 
					<br><b>Step 10.</b> The last 2 items are on the king of evil himself...Sir Lucan D'Lere (Captain of the miltia on Freeport) Every time you kill sir Lucan you get some plate boots which are plus 9 strength and a testament proving he used to be a paladin. Give this piece of paper to the person in the Knights of Truth Hall as proof of Lucan's Death and receive a Brilliant Sword of Faith for your heroics!
					<br><b>Step 12.</b> Once you have the Sword, Testament, Old Note and Hilt....go back to splitpaw and give them all at once to brother Hayle. He will then give you the Soulfire. The Soulfire is 45, 23 2H slash with plus 7 str and plus 7 wis. It has 5 charges of complete.
					<br><br>Please note: To get the Testament of Marr, simply go to the East Commonlands and give Altunic Jarin a cloth shirt (med). This will make a guy named Squire Narls POP. Kill him and take his head and give it to Altunic. Altunic will give you a coin. Then, go talk to the paladin who stands on the grass of the Knights of Truth area of Freeport. Ask him about the quest again and tell him what Altunic told you to say. He will then tell you to kill some spiders or something...basically go to the store and buy some newbie items and return them to him. Once you do that he will tell you its time to take the ultimate test...killing an enemy of Marr. A guard will pop in the sewer entrance behind the Paladin guild. He is like lvl 5 and extremely easy to kill. Grease him and take his helmet over to the same paladin and give it to him. He will give you another coin. Give him back both coins and he will give you the necessary testament for the soulfire quest.

				<FONT color=#0000ff><b>Lyunga's Gem Collection:</b> </FONT> (Trallak and Uggluk)  
				<br>In the Innothule swamp, you talk to Lyunga, a wandering NPC troll female that can usually be found near the entrance to Guk.  After level 10 or so she will tell you that she collects gems. By the upper teens, she will tell you about her gem collection and that she wants more.  Ask her what gems and she will tell you that she wants a ruby. In return for the ruby, she gives one of several items.  Ones I know of are the Brutechopper axe, the Midnight Mallet and Ivander's hoop.  The criteria for what you get seems unclear and could just be random.

				<FONT color=#0000ff><b>Trumpy Irontoe(Bloodforge Hammer):</b> </FONT>
				<br>Upon completion of a smaller previous quest in Kaladim Byzar Bloodforge asks if you'd be willing to take a little trip. If you say you will, he tells you about Trumpy Irontoe.  He says he doesn't know where he is, but that he had been engaged to his sister and ran off on her.  He wants his head for this affront to the family honor and promises to make you an honorary member of the Bloodforge Brigade for returning the head.  Trumpy hangs out at the Fish's Ale in Qeynos.  Your reward for this quest is usually a bloodforge hammer, a very nice 2HB magical weapon.  The secret to killing Trumpy is you have to get him away from Barstomper.  In order to do this you ask him in the bar about Sragg.  He then gets all puffy and walks out.  If you follow him he will get quite a ways from the bar.  You can then safely attack and kill him. No guards or anyone will interfere with the battle, but be warned he will run away so a good root spell or snare is a good idea.  Do not chase him either he will come back if you let him and enventually he will run back by barstomper and then you have a much bigger fight on your hands.  You must have a good faction in order to be able to get the hammer.  If you hail him first he will tell you about some beads.  If you ask him about the beads you will know if you have a good faction.  He may say that your shifty eyes tell him you are not good and in that case you do not.  If you do then you can give him the head and he will give you the bloodforge hammer.

				<FONT color=#0000ff><b>Observer Staff:</b> </FONT>
				<br>At the observatory past the windmills in the Steamfonts a female gnome name Brona Frugrin is a telescope lens crafter and she believes that if you can get the lense of the beholder named Borxx, who is located somewhere in Runnyeye, and return it to her, she can create a telescope unlike any other.  Borxx is a L30  Evil Eye-type monster.  Bringing back his loot... a lense, will yield an awesome 2h blunt weapon called the Observer's Staff.   It also carries charges with the L8 Enchanter spell "Sentinel"  which will warn you of approaching hostiles which is very useful while meditating. (Submitted by Tothis and Wicca)

				<FONT color=#0000ff><b>Crafted Armor:</b> </FONT>
				<br>The centaur vendor in South Karana has a brother.  They both now are willing to make armor like we have never seen before, or so they claim.  They can make a complete set of armor as follows:  Gauntlets: Aviak Charm (off Avocet) and 2 Star Rubies;  Boots: Frost Totem (Ice Goblin Patriarch in Permafrost), and 2 Sapphires;  Helm: Fire Totem (Fire Goblin High Cleric, Solusek), 2 Rubies; Vambrace: Eye of a Griffon, 2 Fire Emeralds;  Bracers: 3 Evil Eye Optic Nerves and a Sapphire;  Greaves: Dark Circlet from the necromancer in Najena, 2 Star Rubies;  Pauldrons: all three parts to the Rune of the Dwarves (Evil Eyes in Runnyeye) and a Fire Emerald;  Breastplates: Werewolf Talons(Gypsies) from Mistmoore and 3 Rubies.  For the stats on this armor check out the Magical Armor Sets section.  With the recent patch most of the "rare" gems are now purchaseable, thus makeing the acquisition of these items available to lower level, but rich, players.

				<FONT color=#0000ff><b>Electrum Bladed Wakizashi:</b> </FONT>
				<br>Lord Grimlot in South Karana tells you about his poor, misguided beloved Arlena, who has run away from him to Mistmoore castle.  Being the sentimental type, he wants you to track down the lass, kill her and return her lute of the gypsy to him.  When you return it to Grimrot, you will receive two items:  a blackened blade hilt (LORE) and a note, and more info on how to complete the quest.  Take the note to the NPC Dekam N'Tazi near SK guild in Neriak, and you will get a LORE item, blackened iron mold, a container with 2 slots in it plus a combine button. He will also explains you need some metal to forge the blade. We found only enchanted electrum bar works. Put the enchanted electrum bar + hilt into the mold and hit combine to make the wakizashi, remember the blade is NO DROP so only the user should combine the items.

				<FONT color=#0000ff><b>Jeweled Skull:</b> </FONT>
				<br>Yiz Pon in Western Karana will ask you to deliver a note to his brother in Freeeport named Hyrill Pon.  Yiz is running from Splitpaw and some beast is after him. Very soon after you first talk to him a Splitpaw assassin (lvl 16) will appear. Kill him and you can loot a hollow skull container (two slots) from the assassin. Apparantly, Yiz stole this skull in Splitpaw, but then he gave it to assassin to stop hunting him.  However, the assassin is still was trying to kill him. Take the note from Yiz to his brother Hyrill Pon in Freeport (West Freeport).  He will tell you that his brother was searching for some powerful skull which should add great powers to a wizard. You now have to find two ruby eyes for the skull (two slots), put them into the hollow skull and hit combine.  The problem is finding the ruby eyes.  The first eye is found on Lyunga in Innothule Swamp.  Unfortunately, she has to be killed and looted, which means a fight with a level 32'ish spellcaster, as well as (most likely) major faction hits in Grobb. The eye itself is a 'Large Ruby' that gives a whopping +1 int when worn.  The second eye (which has been confirmed as such with Identify) is called a 'Ruby Pendant' and loads on a shaman named Kurrpok who spawns in Paw.  This 'eye' also gives a +1 int bonus.  Put them in the skull and combine and you get yourself a jewelled skull, which is a pretty nice magic item.  ( +5 int, +20 Hp, +20 mana, -5 Cold protection)  (Submitted by Rendor and Allamar)
