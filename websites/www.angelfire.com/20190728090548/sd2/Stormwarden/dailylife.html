<P> Hello all, Nanny here.  Just announcing that the officers are going to shape up.  This does not mean more TPs and REZes but in fact we will be doing more events, fun things and the likes.  We will be working on the site more often and having much more work done all around.  We look forward to doing a better job.

<P><font color="yellow"> <U>Sep 19th, 2001</U></font><BR>
<P>Well much has happened and is happening now with the Stormie community. Although some of our higher level players have left for more powerful guilds we ourselves still have many great and high level players. Soon we will be in good position to start raiding some of the more difficult zones, such as Tofs, kael, Velks Lab etc. This is of course good news for many of us.
<P>Einlaan has completed yet another 2 parts of his Temple or Ro Cleric Quests - give him a big Grats next time you see him on line.Einlaan is fast becomming a resourceful and reliable cleric for us. Doing quests is something i encourage every Stormie to pursue. Cheers and Congratualtions my fellow cleric.
<P>Several druids have began their Epic Weapon Quests. Although many of the Epics are long and somewhat frustrating tasks, i want you all to know that we are here for you any time you need a hand. Help a druid get his/her epic and they will help you in return. GL to all those whove started this quest.
<P>Many of you are aware that we are fast becomming allies with the Remanants. I encourage and ask that if you see that <Remanant> tag, stop a moment to say hello, trade buffs, swap stories, or hunt together. These are our new brothers and sisters in arms against the hords of evil that waylay our beloved Norrath.
<P>We have two raids comming up, 21st = CC with the Remanants, and the 29th a multi guild raid on MM. Pls read up on these events via the message board, Event page, or ask about it online. Also please try to attend if your of the appropriate level, make arrangements with our many druids (Kelthis, Buffa or Thundermare) for ports should you need it well in advance of the posted times. Get there early or even the night before and camp at the location if possible. It will make things go much smoother and faster. There is nothing more frustrating than being in the middle of a raid and having to stop fighting 20 mobs, risking the fate of dozen of guildmates and friends just to port some lazy player who could not bother to get his/her port the day before.
<P>Thats it for now folks - log in and lets see some Gold XP.

<P><font color="yellow"><U>July 22nd: GUK RAID FOLLOW UP</U></font><BR>
The following is a field report from the teams who fought in upper guk, after will be a brief report from the lower GUK teams.<BR>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<P>UPPER GUK battle report:<BR>
-------------------------------
<P> 
The Upper Guk team lead by myself, Thundermare Cloudstride, went fairly decent for the majority of the time. We waited for all to arrive, and proceeded to the Summoner and Priest spawn area, which is a bit deep into Upper Guk. I was hoping that after camping this spawn numerous times, we would collect an Amethyst Bracelet (5AC, 3 wis, 15HP) off the priest or possibly a Brazier off the Summoner (the Brazier allows you to summon a fire elemental of approximately 16th lvl regardless of class). 
<P> 
The two groups were as follows: <a href="pics/GUK_raid2.jpg">Team One - Thundermare (leader), Thyloc, Iluminata, Anarkyx, Kingheavyj; Team Two -Tricon (leader), Gortticus, Divoran, Ilania, and Regorr.</a>

<P>
We were able to make it up to a safe area to buff and rest right before approaching the room. After buffing, we were ready and charged the area. Unfortunately I had killed the most frogloks in my life compared to the others in my group so naturally, everything aggroed on me. I thought *I'm dead* as my health bar faded before my eyes. However, my group was able to heal me quickly and draw everything away. Iluminata tried mezzing everything, but there was so much confusion, that it did little or no good. However, 6 vs 10 is not fair, and their corpses quickly piled near our feet. We slayed them all within about two minutes. 
<P>
This was our first battle, and I was actually rather surprised we were able to dispatch of them so quickly. After the battle, we quickly med (thanks to Iluminata's breeze spells) and were ready again for another battle. I, unfortunately, had not researched the spawn time of the room, so I had no idea when they would pop. It happened to be after about 10 minutes that the room spawned again. We slayed them, with ease, in a short amount of time. The loot on the Priest was to be sneezed at except for the rod it carried which our chanter quickly picked up for a future quest of hers. After looting, Iluminata quickly placed herself on one of the four poles surrounding the room claiming it her throne and making us her slaves (now I wouldn't have minded that if she only had her high elf illusion on...heheh).
<P> 
While we were resting, a 44 level druid named Kandavane, on his way to Lower Guk, passed by and questioned what we were all doing here. After replying we were having a raid, he buffed most of us with his high level skin spell and bid us farewell. 
<P> 
Our next few battles went fairly well and we had the area camped fairly well. But we had other places that we had planned to camp. So after medding, we quickly went off to camp the Nokta Shaman who drops the Globe of Shadows (a quest item needed by our good friend Tricon. Alas, we should have stayed for we knew not what lied ahead.
<P> 
We decided not to invis ourselves and instead fight our way to the next camp sight. The cons were generally blue, even, and the rare yellow as we passed through. We quickly dispatched of each foe, but no thanks to our tanks who proceeded to attack everything Iluminata mezzed (she was rather angry with our group's performance near the end of the raid).
<P> 
Finally, after a few battles and meds in between, we reached the spawn area of the Nokta Shaman. We had to destroy it's placeholder first, however. After quickly dispatching of them, we proceeded to rest and med. While healing our wounds and cleaning up the bodies from the floor, a player named Raamus approached us. We greeted him and gave him buffs. He thanked us and went on his way.....
<P> 
No more than a minute later did our friend come back....with friends. Behind him were about 4 froggies. They were all black to me, but I thought with ten players on our side, we wouldn't have a problem. I was wrong. As soon as Raamus came, the frogs immediately aggroed on our poor enchanter and she was quickly slain...so fast, we never noticed it since we knew not what was going on. After seeing our comrade fall, we quickly went to slay the beasts. Alas, I guess our chanter did some good in our battles because they were very difficult without her. More frogs joined in as they spawned from both adjacent rooms. The battle lasted about 5 minutes, and then it was finally over, the room filled with the stench of blood. 
<P> 
No sooner had we dispatched of all the frogs when the room we were in finally spawned...Nokta included. Our casters were out of mana, including myself, so I decided that instead of medding, I would get my hammer out. Because I had no mana, I was unable to snare any of the frogs, who quickly ran and got their friends. The battle raged on and on. I don't know how, but we managed to be the victor, with no more deaths. 
<P> 
Tricon looted the corpse of the Nokta Shaman only to find a Fine Steel Morning Star there. Alas, our friend would not get his quest item after all. We all decided it was best to move on to the ancient croc room before "Raamus" came back with another train. Aye, all watch out for Raamus...he doesn't think before he does things. I guess some people are like that. 
<P> 
We had to fight our way out of the rooms to the big area with water to reach the ancient croc. A few of our members had left, and we were down to seven. The battles were tougher now than before, as well as slower. But we eventually came out to be the victor. Finally, we approached the water and made our way through the underground water cavern to the room were the ancient croc spawned...only to find it being camped by a 40 mage. Alas, I despise people who farm for items off of rare spawns that people like myself just want to camp to get the item for myself. But I digress, and we decided to move back to the summoner and priest room and find the rare items we wanted.
<P> 
Again, we had to fight our way through to the room. The battles were long, but we prevailed. We were almost to an area close to the room where we could med and rest, and I decided we should dispatch of the few frogs left near the cliff area. Alas, that was a mistake I made which cost many lives. There happened to be more frogs than I thought over that cliff. About 3 of them attacked us at first. But we were just about out of mana, and I could not cast a snare on them all. As a result, we had runners, which brought more to the area where we were fighting. More and more joined the fray, and as we thought we had taken out the last one, another two came to make sure we were disposed of. 
<P> 
The battle raged on and on. Tricon and Ilania lost their lives during the battle at some point. I thought we were surely doomed, but Iluminata, her sweet loveable self, was able to mez all but one as we focused our attacks on a single opponent. With our nukers gone, we had to rely on brute strength and agility to get us out of the mess. Somehow, we finally prevailed and proceeded to a safe area to meditate. 
<P> 
Tricon quickly called out my name, and I proceeded to invis and get him. After looting his corpse, I heard the cries of Ilania. I knew our group needed to call it a night, so I decided we should just invis, drag our corpses to the entrance and leave. Alas, we had received no items that we were hoping for, and had many deaths. On the up side, we did receive a good bit of experience (myself gaining a yellow bubble). With that, and a lack of sleep that night, I camped.
<P> 
NOTE: Before the raid, early people were treated to a wonderful language session by Dennli. It was all rather amusing, and drinks were passed out too. All in all, this was a good raid in general. Though not a whole lot of exp was gained and no rare items were receieved, the important thing was we were together and had lots of fun!

On monday the 2nd a guild meeting was held in SK at the centaur village. Things got off to a slow and rocky start as many members kept on attacking the non-aggressive centaurs. The poor beasts fought bravely and killed a few of our own purely out of self defence. But i dont blamn the centaurs, they were kind enough to allow us to host our event in their remote village and we slaughter their kin. <BR>
Several topics were scheduled for discussion but alas the mob was restless. 
When things finnaly got underway, Dennli made a brief speach about the rapid growth of the guild, but was interupted several times. Abandoning all topics Dennli got to the point of the meeting quickly, his resignation as Guild leader. 
<P>Dennli served as Guild Leader for the past Seven months. He has been there from the humble begginings in GreaterFaydark back in December/January when the guild was formed with Dercarc (aka - Nanarc). Most of the starting members are no longer around but Dennli has stuck with the guild through thick and thin. His dedication and strength has been a driving force behind the survival and growth of the guild as a whole. Many of the guild members were invited personally by him, as he travelled the lands of Norrath shouting his infamous "Stormwarden Guild Now accepting new members."
<P>Think back to those days, of new beggings, of new friendships. For each day is a new begging.
<P><center><I> "I would like to extend a personal thanks to all those who have joined the Guild and made it what it is today. I could not have had the adventures i have had without all of you.<BR>~~Dennli</center>

<P>The Role of Guild Leader has been passed onto Ralerwen, a halfelf ranger, who has proven his worth time and time again to the guild. Ralerwen was chosen for his dedication and understanding of what we stand for. Prase be Stormwarden, and Hail Ralerwen the NEW GUILD LEADER!
<BR>HAIL!
<BR>HAIL!
<BR>HAIL!

Well we had a fairly hecktic time during the Unrest Raid - many ppl below lvl 20 showed up and had a difficult time. As a result many ppl lost a lot of xp. But the Raid was posted for lvl 20+ and everyone knew the risks. For others it was their first time in Unrest and needless to say there is a certain style of play that the zone requires in order to survive. Many did not know of the mobing garden trash and as a result there was alot of running to the zone. Needless to say a green con does not mean its an easy kill when the mob runs and gets 4 or 5 of its friends. Even those tiny unsuspecting Death Beetles would swarm even the most seasoned of fighters and bring him to his grave.
<P>Towards the end of the raid, and after many revives and xp rez's, prizes were giving away at the tunnel entrance to /random winners. Here is a list of the items won:<BR>
<LI>Aelor - Giant Foremans Tunic
<LI>Liania - Drake Hide Leggs
<LI>Bendhuin - Lumberjack cap
<LI>Erial - LegChopper
<LI>Varani - Shiny Brass Shield

<P> Wile the lower levels gruped up and kept mainly to the first floor a few of us who where higher in levels camped the barkeep and had a fun time dealing with super mob pulling and alot of crowd control. Thanks Kelthe for keeping us safe with that mezmorizing touch you have. Our orignial goal was to camp the Ghost in the basement and get everyone jagged bands and perhaps a pair of Dwarven Work Boots but unfortunatly the Ghost was camped by a 51 Pally and we had to be content with the Barkeep.
<P>Thanks everyone who made it to the raid, and congratulations to those who won prizes. Although it was not overly successful for some as others we all had a chaoticly fun time. Keep the raid ideas comming in, you can post em on the msg board.

Its been a whole month since the last update. But now i have some time today and am here to lay it all on ya. We recently lost some good friends and guildmates over differences of gameplay - they will be missed and will remain friends to us all. Those of you involved know who this referrs to.

<P>Ralerwen hosted the first lowbie raid on Befallen and was a huge success for those who attended. Great loots and much xp were gained by all who attended. Im sure there are some stories out there from that day. All i can say is Grats Raler on a job well done and we all look forward to the next one.

<P>Second id like to say also that the Officers Raid on the FV Drachnid Spiders was also a success. Many of the officers attended, and we killed constantly for about 2-3hours. Most of us received a fair amount of xp - except for Tenolil who is many levels above us and unfortunalty did not receive any. But with out his strong arm and amazing pulling abilities the battles would have been much more difficult for the rest of us. Buffya even had the opportunity to port a few ppl in FV and made about 150-200pp from ports. So all you druids out there if you want to make cash fast and easy, head to FV bind there and start porting at inflated prices. After the event at the Spiders we moved onto Rath mtn and got Ralerwen his ivy helm. The whole thing was alot of fun. 

<P>Lastly id like to welcome all of our newest members who have recently joined. In case you have not had the chance to read our <a href="charter.html"> Guild Charter</a> id like to remind all of our principle rules (1) help your fellow guildmates (2) Explore the zones and adventue through questing (3) have fun (4) and above all NO BEGGIN. 
<P>I am constantly amazed by our members willingness to lend a hand should it be needed. This is a great tradition that im sure will be carried on by our newer members. The other day many of us travelled to Rathe Mtn so that Ralerwen (Ranger extroidinare) could complete his Ivy Helm quest. It was fun and id do it again for anyone. If you need help with a quest, item camp, etc, more than likely someone will be there for you.

Another couple among our guild.  Ilania and Nanarc announced their engagement during the Runnyeye guild raid.  Some members celebrated after buying most of the poor barkeeps stock in Rivervale.  The couple hopes to marry soon but things are on hold as Nanarc has to get a new account.

Well the raid last night in Runnyeye was a huge success. We did a lot of damage to the ranks of the Goblins who enhabite the Runnyeye zone, that im sure they will think twice about messing with us again. It took us a bit to get orgainized, there was much chaos and Frenzzied killing at first but eventualy we settled into the King Room. We Fought, drank, joked and gennerally had a good time. Little xp was gained, but we were there to outfit Ralerwen in some new cloths. His old leathers and chain were starting to smell - LOL (/em hold his nose). Ralerwen is now outfitted in a complete set of BI armor as a result of the raid. Thanks to all those who helped out. 
<P>Continuing on the good news we have another engagement to announce: Nanarc and llania are officially engaged. Late last night the two travelled the land together last night and Nanarc proposed. HOORRRAYYY!!!

<P>Guild meeting today - so ill have more updates later

The Race this past weekend went over fairly well. We had two teams participate, for a total of 7 contestants. Add in the 4 Refs and that is a total of 11 - not bad for our first event. Team One had a slow start and could not catch up to Team Two. Team Two was fast off the mark leaving Team One trailing. Team One ran into some difficulty when passing through Kithcor when the night time spawn of undead rose up and took them out of the race just before their Highhold checkpoint. An unfortunate thing to happen.
<P>Team One collected a bag full of Velious weapons and 115pp. You can see Tenolil sporting his new Battle axe - looks great. Team One received assistance on their CR from Dennli and a few others and consolation prizes of Frost weapons, some Sarnack swords (no special stats but looks neat) and the druid received a BEM -Black Enameld Mace.
<P>I want to thank Regorr, Buffya and Xanthium for taking the time to be our Refs. You guys did a great job!!! I know it was boring just hanging out for a couple of hours waiting to hand out items but with out you the Race could not have happened. (/em Cheers and Claps - Hurray!)  
<P>After the race was over many of the players from Team One stayed in Highhold to seek vengance on the Gnolls and Orcs that inhabit the zone. Dennli and Lenadil headed out to camp the Evil Eyes in the Gorge for the PPB drop (Polished Bone Bracers +3wiz+3int). After about an hour Dennli managed to get two and is now seeking an untwinked Cleric to whom he can pass down his +15mana+15HP bracers too, so if you be a young cleric send me a tell.
<P>Dennli was supposed to log out and do some RL work, but had the opportunity to show Tenolil to Kunark, Lake of Ill Omen and Frontier Mountain. Once there Gween, a lvl 30 druid, was invited into the guild and all three headed to FM to hunt Giants. I mean Giant hunting versus RL, common...LOL. So the stormwarden guild made its presence known in FM and many a Giant were slain. However on one bad pull Gween was stepped on by a giant and everyone ran to zone, except for Dennli who ran in circles kiting a giant. It was the Funniest thing you'll ever see a dwarf do.

<P>Have a good hunting story, or wanna tell us of your adventures... email them in and we can post your "happenings" on the page.

Well we have some new members in the Guild from the Qeynos Hills area. We began the Guild in Gfay and its nice to see us expancing our guild to other zones.
Having said that I ran from FreePort to assisst some of our newer members gain a level -(cough)(chough)PL(Cough). We hunted the nasty Gnolls in the Black Burrow Lair- one of my personal
favorite low level dungeons. Our camp us at the snake pit and Halo, Ambyr and Mummer slayed many many many gnolls. The bodies were all over the place, even Halo's and Mummer's. 
Ambyr was the only who survived.
<P>Everyone gained xp and Ambyr gained a level.WooT WooT.
<P>I am currently in Kunark in Lake Of Ill Omen - so i will be unable to do invites into the Guild this week. Should you have someone who wishes to join the guild take their name
and we will get to the invites this weekend. 
<P>Happy Leveling for now. Lets see more last names out there (/em Smiles).

The situation with Xismatil has been resolved. I confronted him late last night in Crushbone and we discussed what happend. Kelthie and Xismatil have made a truce. At the same time Xismatil asked to rejoin the Guild and I personnaly felt that at this time his membership was simply not wanted or needed. If any Officer or member is approaced by Xismatil for membership- politely tell him not at this time. I ask that we all just forget about this ugly incident. But again i urge you to be wary of beggers.</P> 
<P>The Guild Policy of NO BEGGIN means that we ignore those who beg - you know the type, "gimmie plat", "gimmie your weapons", "hey man got a spare Yak i can have." These are the types of beggers we refuse, ignore and tell to jump into the pit. We do however wish to offer a helping hand to someone if they need some buffs for a CR, or assistance in obtaining an item, or guide them somewhere. </P>
<P>Everyone is leveling nicely, and starting to spread out accross Norrath. This is good. Need people to start working on a trade skill - the guild needs jewlers and at least a few brewers = ). Give it a thought and see if you would consider taking up a trade skill.
<P>The response im getting from the event posted has been good. So far Buffya, Xanthium, myself(Dennli) are Ref's, we still need another 3 possibly 4 for the task. Xanthium has the Bards Guild location in FP, all the other spots are still up for grabs. Once we have our Ref's chosen the event can be set in motion. Just send me a tell, email or post on the msg bord if you wish to be a ref. This is a good opportunity to show yourself as a Guild Officer candidate (wink)(wink).

<TD><align="Top">Late this night i was called over to invite someone into the guild -  Xismatil. Shortly after he started beggin for plat so he could buy a robe. When his cry for free plat went unanswered he temped one of our members with promises of better equipment. He convinced our friend to give his 
own robe and head gear in exchange for better items. However Xismatil then logged and never returned. ;(<BR>
<P>A collection was started and we managed to raise 220plat and some change, which we will use to buy a newer better robe and headgear to replace the one lost.
<P>Let this incident be a stern reminder of our Number one Rule - We have NO respect for beggers, and will never beg. personally id rather run through lavastorm naked without spells, than beg. <BR></TD></TD></align></Table>

Derkarc and Seddowen are still ready to pound their computers to pieces.  They like to spend time on EQ in short five minute sprints.
Also levels are raising quickly in the guild  Congrats to Olympia on 17, and possibly whatever she's to now.</P>

<P>Time runs short guys, the first raid in comming up soon.  Would everyone please vote on which zone to raid - let your voice be heard.  Currently BB and CB are in the lead.  CrushBone would be a good place.  It keeps everyone close to a city and close to help.  It also allows people to get bind easy to.  There are many people in Greater Faydark that are willing to give binds.</P>

Chambawamba has been lost to our guild.  They felt that 
the guild should only look out for the guild and that everyone else can...
  Well we won't use her words.  I'd just like to remind anyone that may 
share their view that you were all not in the Stormwarden.  Stormwarden 
took everyone in, it hardley mattered who you were.  And as it states in
 the charter, we are to be kind to others outside the guild.  We then have
 more allies.</P>
