Faction goes down with Broken Skull Clan and, I think, Greenbloods.

<A NAME=eyes>
Fire Beetle Eyes:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>In Grobb, talk to Basher Nindan or something similar. His name doesn't matter, he doesn't move around. Right before the tunnel to Innothule Swamp is Basher Razbaz. Go past him, away from the tunnel and Priest of Discord, and there is a small river. Swim along it, and on the right will be a cage with a Froglok prisoner and a Basher or two. Follow this area's tunnel to the back, where the correct Basher is. If hailed, he tells you to bring him 3 Fire Beetle eyes, and he will give you "shinies".  You get a minor gem or jewel for returning the items, and occasionally a minor magic item (such as a Brass Earring).  You also get a positive faction hit with Da Bashers and a negative faction hit with the Broken Skull Clan. (Submitted by Slekk)

You also get positive faction with Da Bashers and negative faction with the Broken Skull Clan.   You can do it as much as you want. He must be really hungry.  (Submitted by KingOgg)

Fungus Dung Pie:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>Hergror is hungry, and he wants a Fungus Dung Pie (yech). He says to go to tell Carver Cagrek "Hergror wants his Fungus Dung Pie".  He is the troll on the dias in front of the Shaman's Guild near the bank.  When you talk to Cagrek, he complains that Hergror is always hungry and that he needs 4 Fungus Spores to make a pie, but not to hit them too hard or you ruin them.  You can get the spores off of the Fungus Ancient in Upper Guk.  If you complete this and give Hergror the pie, he will award you with some patchwork, leather or raw-hide armor.

In fact, he really wants three such tunics PLUS 2 gold.  He says he will open the coffers of nightkeep and pay you a reward.  This is the shadowkinght guild in Oggok.

HEHE meat:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>This is the quest to get the Grobb Cleaver.  It starts in Grobb (of course).  Talk to Carver, by the Shaman's guild, and he will tell you he wants 3 pieces of a meat called "HEHE meat" and the recipe to make it.  You can purchase the meat in Oggok from Dooga the Ogre Chef----TROLLS ARE KOS TO CHEF DOOGA---.  (She has a seperate quest to deliver froglock legs).   He will send you to deliver a Grub Locker of Dwarf Pickles to his Troll friend in the Ocean of Tears, Nerbilik.  Nerbilik is fishing on the Siren rocks.  Be careful, since I have been told the guards may kill you even though they con indifferent.  Give him the locker and you will receive approximately 1 plat, increased faction with DaBashers and decreased faction with BrokenSkull Clan, and some xp.  However, he will refuse to give you the recipe he has, so you need to kill him and loot it from his corpse.  Then take the recipe and 3 HEHE meats back to Carver and he will give you a Grobb Cleaver for you efforts.  (Submitted by Ashrum)

<A NAME=love>
Hulkulk's Love: </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> Be forewarned that this quest will lower your faction with the dark bargainers.  In the Night Keep, talk to Hukulk.  He mentions [Helm of Hukulk], and upon asking him about the helm, he refers to a Lynuga who broke his heart.  Hukulk asks that you go to Neriak to see who Lynuga meets with, possibly kill them, and return the head of her lover and the Bracers of Love that he gave to her.  In return, Hukulk will give you an extra Helm of Hukulk.  I am told you need to give him both the bracers and the head (presumably of Lumpkin) to get the helm.  Lynuga can be occasionally found floating in the water near the entrance to Guk. She won't mention anything about the [Happy Love Bracers] but if you  ask her about them, she will tell you she gave the ugly things to her boyfriend, Guard Lumpkin, in Neriak and that the relationship was over.  Lumpkin will tell you that Ratraz now has the bracers.  Ratraz is a bouncer in the Maiden's Fury in Neriak.  You have to kill Ratraz. If he runs while your fighting him, and you're a troll or ogre, be aware that you may have to duck while chasing him through some of the lower arches in Neriak, so you will have to reclick your autoattack. I haven't had anyone jump in on that battle yet and I've let him run pretty far before. From him you will get the happy love bracers (AC 1 bracers, I'd use them just for the name alone if they weren't so lousy), his head, and a warclub. Watch out!  You do NOT want to give his head to Hululk! Lumpkin was the one who stole Lyguna from Hulkulk, not Ratraz! Either put his head in a seperate container or destroy it.  The warclub is a decent non-magic blunt weapon that you can sell for quite a few plat. Ratraz is about 19th level.   Now you need to get Lumpkin's head. This is more of a trick. He is found in the Foreign Quarter of Neriak. He runs around a couple of the back rooms.  Attack him when he is as deep in these rooms as he gets! He is also about 19th and tries to run when hurt enough. If he gets far enough a high level shadow knight jumps in and you're basically doomed.  From him you get his head and a rusty halberd.  Take his head and the Happy Love Bracer's back to Hululk to get your prize, the Helm of Hukulk AC5 +3 strength +3 agility, wearable by evil races only helmet and some money (even up to some plat!) , experience, and Faction.  Note about factions. You will take faction hits from Neriak Outer Guard for killing both Lumpkin & Ratraz. All I know is half the merchants in the foreign quarter will no longer sell to me, it may be from doing this quest or it may be from killing the visiting priestess in Nejena.  Be warned.  Also if your standing is too low with shadowknights (or perhaps if you are not a troll shadowknight), you will get nothing for turning in the quest items to Hulkulk. (Submitted by Igjarjuk and ).

  After asking about the quest, the first skel will spawn at the bar (behind the Warrior guild) target him and say "will you come home to the closet"<P>
 he will ask for Grobb Oven Mittens. If you ask Carver Cravek about the mittens he will tell you he wants 3 Froglok meat and 10gp. Give them to him and you will get the mittens (AC4 +5vsFire). Give them to the skel and he will agree to go back to the closet. He will also tell you that Basher Nanum (not sure of name, but the same one that give Fire Beetle eye quest) has seen his friend "The Butcher" and that you should ask him "wheres the skelten".<P>
 Go the the Basher and ask "where is the skeleton" and the 2nd skel will spawn near Carver Cravek.
Ask the second skel "will you come back to the closet". He will tell you that he will only come if you get him a Ogre Baking Apron. You get this from Chef Dooga in Ogguk, of course Trolls are KOS by her, so you will have to get a friend to ask/get it for you. To get the apron you have to "prove that you are a baker" by giving her 3 Pickled Froglok Meats (froglok meat+vinegar+jug of sauce) and 10gp.<P>
When you give the 3 Pickled Froglok to Chef Dooga she gives you the Ogre Baking Apron (Tunic:AC6 +5vsFire). Give it to the second skeleton and he agrees to go back to the closet. <P>He will tell you to ask Basher Sklama about his friend "The Captain". Sklama is the basher closest to the newbie area just to the left of the Grobb entrance.<P> Ask Sklama "where is the captain" and he will tell you that "he is on a little island in dis swamp."<P>

The third skel is in the middle of the swamp, you have to spend some time looking for him. He will say that he lost his ship and is willing to buy a new ship.<P>

You can buy the ship in a bottle from Clurg.. Trolls are KOS in the area because of Chef Dooga, so beware<P>
btw: the ship in a bottle is NO DROP
