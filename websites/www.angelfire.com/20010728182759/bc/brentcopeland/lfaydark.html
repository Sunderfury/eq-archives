Bandit Sisters:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>This starts in Felwithe with the High Elf Paladin Guildmaster.  He will ask you  if you are "ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare"  Say "I am ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare" and he will ask if you are new to this or experienced (something to that degree).  If you say you are inexperienced,  he tells you about a fallen member of his order in Kelethin.   (If you say you are experienced, he gives you the jojongua's pelt quest).   You then need to talk to the drunk named Tandan Nybright in Kelethin and listen to his tale.  His sad story centers around his four daughters in Lesser Faydark who have joined the dervish cutthrouat and are giving his family a bad name.  Being a good father and paladin, he asks you to murder each of his daughters, retrieve their pearl necklaces and return them to him all at once.  Beware.  These bandits are pretty tough and will not willingly part with their jewelry (approximately level 10 to 13).  You will get experience, faction and an item when you return all four necklaces.

<A NAME=gearheart>
Gearheart:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>:   Baxok Curhunter will ask you if you will serve the crown, and once you are about 5th level he will give you a quest to hunt down a stolen clockwork named Gearheart who has been taken by the fae in Lesser Faydark.  Gearheart is found at  the faerie city.   He is in  his mid teens (probably around  level 15). When you kill gearheart, you get a faction loss (faerie), some change and a 'blackbox XIVD' which, when given to Baxok Curhunter, gives you some change, a couple of faction changes, and an item, possibly a round shield.  The quest is worth a platinum or two.  (Submitted by Wael and Toraque) </font></B>
