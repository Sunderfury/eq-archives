Well we had a fairly hecktic time during the Unrest Raid - many ppl below lvl 20 showed up and had a difficult time. As a result many ppl lost a lot of xp. But the Raid was posted for lvl 20+ and everyone knew the risks. For others it was their first time in Unrest and needless to say there is a certain style of play that the zone requires in order to survive. Many did not know of the mobing garden trash and as a result there was alot of running to the zone. Needless to say a green con does not mean its an easy kill when the mob runs and gets 4 or 5 of its friends. Even those tiny unsuspecting Death Beetles would swarm even the most seasoned of fighters and bring him to his grave.
<P>Towards the end of the raid, and after many revives and xp rez's, prizes were giving away at the tunnel entrance to /random winners. Here is a list of the items won:<BR>
<LI>Aelor - Giant Foremans Tunic
<LI>Liania - Drake Hide Leggs
<LI>Bendhuin - Lumberjack cap
<LI>Erial - LegChopper
<LI>Varani - Shiny Brass Shield

<P> Wile the lower levels gruped up and kept mainly to the first floor a few of us who where higher in levels camped the barkeep and had a fun time dealing with super mob pulling and alot of crowd control. Thanks Kelthe for keeping us safe with that mezmorizing touch you have. Our orignial goal was to camp the Ghost in the basement and get everyone jagged bands and perhaps a pair of Dwarven Work Boots but unfortunatly the Ghost was camped by a 51 Pally and we had to be content with the Barkeep.
<P>Thanks everyone who made it to the raid, and congratulations to those who won prizes. Although it was not overly successful for some as others we all had a chaoticly fun time. Keep the raid ideas comming in, you can post em on the msg board.

Its been a whole month since the last update. But now i have some time today and am here to lay it all on ya. We recently lost some good friends and guildmates over differences of gameplay - they will be missed and will remain friends to us all. Those of you involved know who this referrs to.

<P>Ralerwen hosted the first lowbie raid on Befallen and was a huge success for those who attended. Great loots and much xp were gained by all who attended. Im sure there are some stories out there from that day. All i can say is Grats Raler on a job well done and we all look forward to the next one.

<P>Second id like to say also that the Officers Raid on the FV Drachnid Spiders was also a success. Many of the officers attended, and we killed constantly for about 2-3hours. Most of us received a fair amount of xp - except for Tenolil who is many levels above us and unfortunalty did not receive any. But with out his strong arm and amazing pulling abilities the battles would have been much more difficult for the rest of us. Buffya even had the opportunity to port a few ppl in FV and made about 150-200pp from ports. So all you druids out there if you want to make cash fast and easy, head to FV bind there and start porting at inflated prices. After the event at the Spiders we moved onto Rath mtn and got Ralerwen his ivy helm. The whole thing was alot of fun. 

<P>Lastly id like to welcome all of our newest members who have recently joined. In case you have not had the chance to read our <a href="charter.html"> Guild Charter</a> id like to remind all of our principle rules (1) help your fellow guildmates (2) Explore the zones and adventue through questing (3) have fun (4) and above all NO BEGGIN. 
<P>I am constantly amazed by our members willingness to lend a hand should it be needed. This is a great tradition that im sure will be carried on by our newer members. The other day many of us travelled to Rathe Mtn so that Ralerwen (Ranger extroidinare) could complete his Ivy Helm quest. It was fun and id do it again for anyone. If you need help with a quest, item camp, etc, more than likely someone will be there for you.

Another couple among our guild.  Ilania and Nanarc announced their engagement during the Runnyeye guild raid.  Some members celebrated after buying most of the poor barkeeps stock in Rivervale.  The couple hopes to marry soon but things are on hold as Nanarc has to get a new account.
</P>

<P><U>April 22nd</U><BR>
Well the raid last night in Runnyeye was a huge success. We did a lot of damage to the ranks of the Goblins who enhabite the Runnyeye zone, that im sure they will think twice about messing with us again. It took us a bit to get orgainized, there was much chaos and Frenzzied killing at first but eventualy we settled into the King Room. We Fought, drank, joked and gennerally had a good time. Little xp was gained, but we were there to outfit Ralerwen in some new cloths. His old leathers and chain were starting to smell - LOL (/em hold his nose). Ralerwen is now outfitted in a complete set of BI armor as a result of the raid. Thanks to all those who helped out. 
<P>Continuing on the good news we have another engagement to announce: Nanarc and llania are officially engaged. Late last night the two travelled the land together last night and Nanarc proposed. HOORRRAYYY!!!

<P>Guild meeting today - so ill have more updates later 

<P><U><B>April 17th</U><BR>

The Race this past weekend went over fairly well. We had two teams participate, for a total of 7 contestants. Add in the 4 Refs and that is a total of 11 - not bad for our first event. Team One had a slow start and could not catch up to Team Two. Team Two was fast off the mark leaving Team One trailing. Team One ran into some difficulty when passing through Kithcor when the night time spawn of undead rose up and took them out of the race just before their Highhold checkpoint. An unfortunate thing to happen.
<P>Team One collected a bag full of Velious weapons and 115pp. You can see Tenolil sporting his new Battle axe - looks great. Team One received assistance on their CR from Dennli and a few others and consolation prizes of Frost weapons, some Sarnack swords (no special stats but looks neat) and the druid received a BEM -Black Enameld Mace.
<P>I want to thank Regorr, Buffya and Xanthium for taking the time to be our Refs. You guys did a great job!!! I know it was boring just hanging out for a couple of hours waiting to hand out items but with out you the Race could not have happened. (/em Cheers and Claps - Hurray!)  
<P>After the race was over many of the players from Team One stayed in Highhold to seek vengance on the Gnolls and Orcs that inhabit the zone. Dennli and Lenadil headed out to camp the Evil Eyes in the Gorge for the PPB drop (Polished Bone Bracers +3wiz+3int). After about an hour Dennli managed to get two and is now seeking an untwinked Cleric to whom he can pass down his +15mana+15HP bracers too, so if you be a young cleric send me a tell.
<P>Dennli was supposed to log out and do some RL work, but had the opportunity to show Tenolil to Kunark, Lake of Ill Omen and Frontier Mountain. Once there Gween, a lvl 30 druid, was invited into the guild and all three headed to FM to hunt Giants. I mean Giant hunting versus RL, common...LOL. So the stormwarden guild made its presence known in FM and many a Giant were slain. However on one bad pull Gween was stepped on by a giant and everyone ran to zone, except for Dennli who ran in circles kiting a giant. It was the Funniest thing you'll ever see a dwarf do.

<P>Have a good hunting story, or wanna tell us of your adventures... email them in and we can post your "happenings" on the page.
<P><U>Mar 05, 2001</U><BR>
A happy be-lated birthday to Tenolil, who hit 20 years on March 2nd.  (Sorry for the delay on the post here man)
</P>

<P><U>Feb 28, 2001</U><BR>
I'd like everyone to give Tankya a big congrats.  His Birthday was today.  So if you see him  wish him a happy one.

Well we have some new members in the Guild from the Qeynos Hills area. We began the Guild in Gfay and its nice to see us expancing our guild to other zones.
Having said that I ran from FreePort to assisst some of our newer members gain a level -(cough)(chough)PL(Cough). We hunted the nasty Gnolls in the Black Burrow Lair- one of my personal
favorite low level dungeons. Our camp us at the snake pit and Halo, Ambyr and Mummer slayed many many many gnolls. The bodies were all over the place, even Halo's and Mummer's. 
Ambyr was the only who survived.
<P>Everyone gained xp and Ambyr gained a level.WooT WooT.
<P>I am currently in Kunark in Lake Of Ill Omen - so i will be unable to do invites into the Guild this week. Should you have someone who wishes to join the guild take their name
and we will get to the invites this weekend. 
<P>Happy Leveling for now. Lets see more last names out there (/em Smiles).  


<P><U>Feb 23, 2001</U><BR>
The situation with Xismatil has been resolved. I confronted him late last night in Crushbone and we discussed what happend. Kelthie and Xismatil have made a truce. At the same time Xismatil asked to rejoin the Guild and I personnaly felt that at this time his membership was simply not wanted or needed. If any Officer or member is approaced by Xismatil for membership- politely tell him not at this time. I ask that we all just forget about this ugly incident. But again i urge you to be wary of beggers.</P> 
<P>The Guild Policy of NO BEGGIN means that we ignore those who beg - you know the type, "gimmie plat", "gimmie your weapons", "hey man got a spare Yak i can have." These are the types of beggers we refuse, ignore and tell to jump into the pit. We do however wish to offer a helping hand to someone if they need some buffs for a CR, or assistance in obtaining an item, or guide them somewhere. </P>
<P>Everyone is leveling nicely, and starting to spread out accross Norrath. This is good. Need people to start working on a trade skill - the guild needs jewlers and at least a few brewers = ). Give it a thought and see if you would consider taking up a trade skill.
<P>The response im getting from the event posted has been good. So far Buffya, Xanthium, myself(Dennli) are Ref's, we still need another 3 possibly 4 for the task. Xanthium has the Bards Guild location in FP, all the other spots are still up for grabs. Once we have our Ref's chosen the event can be set in motion. Just send me a tell, email or post on the msg bord if you wish to be a ref. This is a good opportunity to show yourself as a Guild Officer candidate (wink)(wink).

<TD><align="Top">Late this night i was called over to invite someone into the guild -  Xismatil. Shortly after he started beggin for plat so he could buy a robe. When his cry for free plat went unanswered he temped one of our members with promises of better equipment. He convinced our friend to give his 
own robe and head gear in exchange for better items. However Xismatil then logged and never returned. ;(<BR>
<P>A collection was started and we managed to raise 220plat and some change, which we will use to buy a newer better robe and headgear to replace the one lost.
<P>Let this incident be a stern reminder of our Number one Rule - We have NO respect for beggers, and will never beg. personally id rather run through lavastorm naked without spells, than beg. <BR></TD></TD></align></Table>

Derkarc and Seddowen are still ready to pound their computers to pieces.  They like to spend time on EQ in short five minute sprints.
Also levels are raising quickly in the guild  Congrats to Olympia on 17, and possibly whatever she's to now.</P>

<P>Time runs short guys, the first raid in comming up soon.  Would everyone please vote on which zone to raid - let your voice be heard.  Currently BB and CB are in the lead.  CrushBone would be a good place.  It keeps everyone close to a city and close to help.  It also allows people to get bind easy to.  There are many people in Greater Faydark that are willing to give binds.</P>

<P><U>January 15, 2001</U><BR>
Chambawamba has been lost to our guild.  They felt that 
the guild should only look out for the guild and that everyone else can...
  Well we won't use her words.  I'd just like to remind anyone that may 
share their view that you were all not in the Stormwarden.  Stormwarden 
took everyone in, it hardley mattered who you were.  And as it states in
 the charter, we are to be kind to others outside the guild.  We then have
 more allies.</P>


<P><U>January 10, 2001</U><BR>
Mimomi logged out early due to a sickness early wednesday night.  Also Derkarc lost his Frozen Long Sword (dmg7 dly26) although on the other hand he gained a Stien of Mogguk and 50pp.  He now is looking for a weapon close to those old stats.  He current holds claws that have (dmg 7 dly30).</P>
