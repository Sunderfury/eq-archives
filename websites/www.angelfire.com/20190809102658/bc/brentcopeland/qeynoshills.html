<A NAME=cheslin>Cheslin's Illusion Cards:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>

Follow the guard Cheslin around and pick up his illusion cards for some experience and gold.  You will probably have to keep him from getting killed by the wandering creatures in order to get all his cards, since he is a total wimp who can get beat up by a rat (or at least a bear).  The cards he drops are Chrono Cyclone, Diamond Vale, Ebon Lotus, and Library of Erudin.  You must give him all 4 cards to get anything. (Or alternately, there is a collector in Freeport seeking 14 rare Illusion cards, including the four Cheslin drops - see Freeport quests).  After giving back Guard Cheslin his four illusion cards, he'll give you experience and a bit of cash.  He will also give you a note to his father in South Qeynos named Chesgard (He's near the Order of Thunder). After you give him the note, he'll thank you and you'll get a larger amount of experience and a nice item.

<A NAME=gnasher> Gnasher's Head:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
This quest starts in Surefall Glade.  Talk to Larsk Juton who has some sort of feud with a gnoll named Gnasher.  Too lazy to do it himself I guess, he wants you to kill his enemy for him.  This gnoll occasionally appears in Qeynos Hills and is around level 10 or so.  Kill him and bring his head back to Lars and you will get some cash.  Sometimes when you kill Gnasher Furrgutt, he is carrying a note from the bartender at Fish's Ale which you can turn in to the authorities. First, give the note to Larsk Juton (the same person you give Gnasher's head to).  Note that you cannot shortcut this by giving the note to Captain Tillian directly. He will give you some experience and a faction adjustment, and advise you to take the note to Captain Tillian in the Arena in Qeynos (the same one you give Gnoll Fangs to). Captain Tillian will give you more experience, more faction adjustments, and a Medal of Merit (a Lore Item which gives you +5 Charisma) for your good deeds. He will then summon the Executioner, who will proceed to Fish's Ale to carry out the sentence of death pronounced on the unwise bartender.   Follow the executioner and watch the fun.  Another note.  If you are carrying gnoll fangs for Captain Tillian, give them to him and go collect the blackburrow stout first, since the executioner will kill your stout connection and he won't respawn for a while.

<A NAME=slayer> The Gnoll Slayer:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Marton Sayor in the cottage in Qeynos Hills is concerned about the safety of his infant son.  He says he will give you the gnoll slayer long sword if you help him.  Marton mentions a named gnoll named Lord Elgnub who speaks common tongue, and has threatened his family.  I'm not sure where to go with this or how nice a sword you get (if any) for completing the quest.

<A NAME=crook>Jaggedpine Crook Staff:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
This quest starts in SureFall Glades.  This quest will not work with too high of a character.  Talk with Corum Finisc, just outside the Jaggedpine of SureFall Glades. After some keywords, he will mention [crook].  This is a Jaggedpine crook staff that is broken in pieces in Qeynos Hills.  Only Gnoll Hunters have the parts.  The gnoll hunters are very rare and getting the staff pieces is difficult.  However, once you have both, go back to Corum Finisc and he will assemble them for you.

<A NAME=millers> The Millers:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
The Miller siblings, Baobob and Chandra, will make bearhide and wolfhide armor for you if you provide them with the proper pelt and some gold.  Just talk to them and follow their instructions.  Baobob makes the wolfhide armor (Belt, boots and cape) and Chandra makes bearhide armor.   Chandra Millers' prices for bearhide armor are as follows:  Bear Hide Belt - 5 GP and Low quality Bear pelt;  Bear Hide Boots - 15 GP and Medium quality bear pelt;  Bear Hide Cape - 21 GP and High quality bear pelt.  This also raises faction with Karana Residents, Guards of Qeynos, Priests of Life and Knights of Thunder.  Be aware that you need to have a high faction with the Karana Residents to get anything made other than a belt.

<A NAME=rat>Rat Ear Pie:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Rephas is a crazed hermit who lives near the lake in the Qeynos Hills, with a penchant for rat ears. If you give him regular rat ears he will grill them for you, and you get a lore item 'Grilled Rat Ears' which are also edible.  Give that back to him and you get a minor item and some faction and experience.  If you give him 3 giant rat ears he will give you a recipe for Rat Ear Pie which does not require a clump of dough (Giant Rat Ears + Baking Spirits + Cup of Four in a mixing bowl, then bake result in an oven). This rat ear pie can then be used in the Paw of Oppola quest.  (Submitted by Malqanar)

<A NAME=initiation>Steel Warrior Initiation:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Go to Brin Stolunger in Warriors Guild S. Qeynos, tell him you are a [young steel warrior]. He will give you a ten slot arena sack and tell you to collect 5 bat wings and 5 snake scales and combine them inside to create a full sack.  When you give it back to him, you get a few copper, xp, faction and a note that you are to take to Axe Broadsmith in Qeynos Hills. (He's in the hut by the pond)  When you give him the note, he will tell you to kill the [strange skeleton] across the pond.  When you kill it, bring it's skull to him as proof, and you'll get more coppers, xp, faction and a letter of recommendation to take back to Brin Stolunger.  When you return to Qeynos and give the letter to Brin, you get MORE coins, xp, faction, and another note.  This one you take downstairs to the animal pits below the arena, and give it to Grahan Rothkar who tells you it's time for your Final Test. He will give you a key to open one of the animal pens so you can enter and fight a young lion. When you kill the young lion, bring it's pelt and meat to Grahan and you'll get MORE copper, xp, faction and  TADA... Strongbear Bracers.  They're magical, AC 1, Agil +1, warrior only, any race.   And he welcomes you to the Steel Warriors!  (Submitted by Mistabus).

<A NAME=talym>Talym Shoontar's Head:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
You must remove the head of the master poacher Talym Shoontar from his shoulders and return it to your guild. This quest can be started either when the guy you turn in the regular poachers head to mentions him (after turning in a poachers head), or directly started by talking to Hagar Sureshot in Surefall Glade. Talym appears in Qeynos Hills, somewhere between the cottage, the road marker, and the Guard Tower. He appears sometime around midnight, although not apparently every day (at least he hasn't appeared at times I have been waiting for him). However, he is about lvl 15, and is roughly on par with Dorn B'Dynn, the scourge of the Northern Desert of Ro.   Plus, if you attack him in Qeynos Hills, the guards will attack you.  For a safer way to kill him, Shoontar also occasionally appears in Fish Tavern's back room, where you turn in the moonstones for gnoll stouts.  This may only happen after the executioner appears following the gnasher's head quest.  Another person spotted Shoontar in Freeport at the docks, so he obviously gets around.  You get money, experience and an item.  (Submitted by Vorador)

<A NAME=taxes>Taxes:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
(All Classes)  Somewhere in South Queynos you will find on the 2nd floor of a building a man with a bad cough.  After talking to him for a bit, he will tell you that he is a tax collecter and needs you to make his runs for him.  He will give you a box, in which to place and combine the taxes, and a scroll with the names of the people.  To get the taxes from the, simply hail them and say "Please pay your taxes."  Doing this will give you a very small lowering of faction with Qeynos merchants.  Upon going to Mira Sayer, In Qeynos Hills, and asking her to pay, she will begin to cry.  When you ask her why she is crying, she will tell you a halfling named Flynn something or other stole her tax money.  He is in Crow's Pub in Qeynos.  Go to him, hail him, and ask him if he stole Mira's tax money.  He will affirm this, and tell you to say "I am a gnoll loving weakling and am not worthy to comb your feet" <grin>  After doing so, he will shout it, and the entire zone will here what an idiot you are.  He'll give you the money, combine it, and give it to the tax man.  You'll get a couple silver, a silver stud, and a Brass Ring.  A tip for those of you who need an extra way to hold items.  If you keep the tax collection box, you will have a 10 slot box to hold items, and you can get this as low as level 1.  Not bad.

<A NAME=varzoom>Varzoom the Undying:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Varsoon of Qeynos Aquaducts and Qeynos Hills is a high level necromancer, and the target of many high-level players.  Immediately after you kill Varsoon, a Varsoon Zombie will spawn in Qeynos Hills, who will run in a straight line for the nearest de-spawning site (so the zombie stays in the zone for less than a minute).  The zombie is called Varsoon the Undying.  I am not sure what happens if you manage to kill the zombie as well.  (Submitted by CloudKraken)
