<A NAME=assassin> The Assassin:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
This quest is sometimes given to you after you complete the Nitrates quest in Surefall Glades.  Return to surefall and give the note to Gerael for status and few coins.  Gerael  returns the note to you and asks you to give it to Captain Tillim in Qeynos. He asks you to also to warn the target (Gash Flockwaller) that [They are Trying to kill him].   Go to Qeynos and give the note to Captain Tillim.  You are rewarded with some faction and told that Gash stays in the Lion's head INN. Going to the Lion's head inn.  Gash Flockwaller should be in a back room during the day. Talking to him and repeating the key phrase as [they are trying to kill you] gives you a clue about the unkempt druids - that they carry [black wood chips].  Somewhere in this the Assassin will attack - his name is Raffel Minnmorn.   At this point the quest may be broken.  One time I beat the assassin with Gash's assistance - as a result the body dissappeared and I couldn't loot it; the second time I got a ranger/druid mob together and we splatted him, but since I hadn't gotten the wood chip comment yet all that I got from him was a rusty dagger.  Raffel con's black to a 10th level ranger, but he has a slew of druid spells and shouldn't be solo'd unless  you are pretty strong or lucky.  So the ending is still unclear.

<A NAME=bayle>The Bayle List:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
A paladin in the Temple of Thunder is investigating corruption among the guards of Qeynos. He asks you to go to Surefall Glade, find Frenway Marthank in the Druids' Guildtree, and ask him for "The Bayle List."  However, when you do, Frenway is in a state of depression.  His son -- who happened to be carrying the very list you're looking for -- was killed and devoured by the great grizzly bear Mammoth, who lives deep in the caves of Surefall Glade.  As a Druid, Frenway is forbidden to harm the bears of the Glade, but he wants vengeance.  If you can find and slay Mammoth, you will get the list, and Frenway will reward you if you return with Mammoth's hide.  However, there are more than a few people in Surefall Glade who will strike you down for attacking the bears, so be very careful.  (Submitted by Shendar)

<A NAME=cloak> Cloak of the Jaggedpine:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
After you turn in Gnasher's head to Larsk Juton, he will sometimes say that he requires your services to [assist in the extermination of the gnoll brewers].  If you say the magic words, he elaborates.  He tells you to go to Blackburrow to kill the gnoll brewers, and bring back any Blackburrow Casks.  "Upon your third cask I shall reward you the [Cloak of Jaggedpine].  The casks are found on the Gnoll Master Brewers and "A gnoll brewer" which are a rare spawn at the end of the bottom bridge by the barrels in Blackburrow.  The reward is the Cloak of Jaggedpine . He hints that one should hold on to it, because "you may never know when we may alter the enchantments placed upon the cloak."  (Submitted by Uvien and Murdoc Dasilva)

<A NAME=gnasher> Gnasher's Head:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
This quest starts in Surefall Glade.  Talk to Larsk Juton who has some sort of feud with a gnoll named Gnasher.  Too lazy to do it himself I guess, he wants you to kill his enemy for him.  This gnoll occasionally appears in Qeynos Hills and is around level 10 or so.  Kill him and bring his head back to Lars and you will get some cash.  Sometimes when you kill Gnasher Furrgutt, he is carrying a note from the bartender at Fish's Ale which you can turn in to the authorities. First, give the note to Larsk Juton (the same person you give Gnasher's head to).  Note that you cannot shortcut this by giving the note to Captain Tillian directly. He will give you some experience and a faction adjustment, and advise you to take the note to Captain Tillian in the Arena in Qeynos (the same one you give Gnoll Fangs to). Captain Tillian will give you more experience, more faction adjustments, and a Medal of Merit (a Lore Item which gives you +5 Charisma) for your good deeds. He will then summon the Executioner, who will proceed to Fish's Ale to carry out the sentence of death pronounced on the unwise bartender.   Follow the executioner and watch the fun.  Another note.  If you are carrying gnoll fangs for Captain Tillian, give them to him and go collect the blackburrow stout  first, since the executioner will kill your stout connection and he won't respawn for a while.

<A NAME=crook>Jaggedpine Crook Staff:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
This quest starts in SureFall Glades.  This quest will not work with too high of a character.  Talk with Corum Finisc, just outside the Jaggedpine of SureFall Glades. After some keywords, he will mention [crook].  This is a Jaggedpine crook staff that is broken in pieces in Qeynos Hills.  Only Gnoll Hunters have the parts.  The gnoll hunters are very rare and getting the staff pieces is difficult.  However, once you have both, go back to Corum Finisc and he will assemble them for you.

One of the men in the JaggedPine Treefolk shop wants you to take a claim check to Nesiff's Wooden Weapons in Qeynos and pick up an icon for him.  Do this chore and he will give you some money and experience.

<A NAME=nitrates> The Nitrates:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Gerael Woodone has a flask he wants delivered to Linaya Sowlin in West Karana.  Doing so results in some faction and a few coppers.  At this point she also asks for your protection from the [unkempt druids] and tells you of a [note].  However, an NPC by the name of Draze Slashyn shows up and immediately threatens Linaya after you deliver the Flask. If you beat him you get Status, Money, a Rusty Axe and the Note Linaya just mentioned. Linaya will ask you to take the note back to Gerael in surefall (see the Assassins Quest).

<A NAME=poacher>Poacher's Head:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Talk to the first ranger you see when you go into the ranger guild house.  It turns out that there is some poacher hunting the animals of SureFall Glade and he wants you to end this dastardly deed and poach the poacher instead.  Bring his head back as proof that the animals are now safe and you will get experience, faction and miney or an item.  Note for the Erudites out there that any poacher head seems to work here.

<A NAME=talym>Talym Shoontar's Head:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
You must remove the head of the master poacher Talym Shoontar from his shoulders and return it to your guild. This quest can be started either when the guy you turn in the regular poachers head to mentions him (after turning in a poachers head), or directly started by talking to Hagar Sureshot in Surefall Glade. Talym appears in Qeynos Hills, somewhere between the cottage, the road marker, and the Guard Tower. He appears sometime around midnight, although not apparently every day (at least he hasn't appeared at times I have been waiting for him). However, he is about lvl 15, and is roughly on par with Dorn B'Dynn, the scourge of the Northern Desert of Ro.   Plus, if you attack him in Qeynos Hills, the guards will attack you.  For a safer way to kill him, Shoontar also occasionally appears in Fish Tavern's back room, where you turn in the moonstones for gnoll stouts.  This may only happen after the executioner appears following the gnasher's head quest.  Another person spotted Shoontar in Freeport at the docks, so he obviously gets around.  You get money, experience and an item.  (Submitted by Vorador)
