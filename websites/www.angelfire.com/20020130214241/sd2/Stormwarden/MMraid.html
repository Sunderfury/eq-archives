<P><B><U>Communication Rules:</B></U>
<BR>1) NO OOC chat. – reserved for Group leaders
<BR>2) NO shout chat – reserved for Raid Leaders / Guild leaders
<BR>3) Keeping these channels clear for Raid organizers is very important. Group leaders MUST be able to see their commands easily. We cannot afford to have messages lost in a sea of babble. Lets keep those lines open – your lives depend on it
<BR>4) Members pls speak through your group leaders. Tells and other chat lines will probably be lost or ignored as we will be busy setting up and moving some 30-40 ppl into position.
