 Well we all know faction for de clerics is horrible in this game but I have a solution to cure most of it.<br>
<br>
The following are faction tricks<br>
<br>
Elves<br>
-ClericsofTunare<br>
-SoldiersofTunare<br>
-EmeraldWarriors<br>
-KingTherisThex<br>
<br>
To do this you must get a share wolf form from a level 39+ druid and maybe a bard faction song. Give Pandos Flintside (while in wolf form) in Freeport 4 sets of 4 muffins at a time and it will raise your faction. An important side effect of this is if you do this quest ALOT it will bottom out your crushbone orc faction (ie you only loose faction with crushbone and not with Indigo brotherhood faction when you kill a crushbone orc)<br>
<br>
Elven Merchants<br>
-FelwitheMerchants<br>
-MerchantsofKelethin<br>
 <br>
The prerequisite to this is doing the pandos quest to bottom out your crushbone orc faction. Goto crushbone and free the elven slaves (only takes about 3 or 4 of them to get up to dubious) the keys are 18 and 19 i beleive. Also note this will probably drop your indigo brotherhood faction to indifferent but thats no biggie<br>
<br>
Fayduer Guards<br>
-Gemchoppers<br>
-Stormguard<br>
-EmeraldWarriors<br>
<br>
To get this is requires alot of time spent on the riptide goblin rocks in oot (its near that troll for the grob cleaver. It will probably take a few hundred to get the guards up to dubious.<br>
<br>
Neriak Factions<br>
-DarkBargainers<br>
-DreadGuardInner<br>
-DreadGuardOuter<br>
<br>
Give red wine to lokar tobiath in neriak 3rd gate library. 4 sets of 4 will do<br>
<br>
<br>
Commonlands faction<br>
<br>
-CommonsResidents<br>
<br>
This is relatively straightforwards kill deathfist orcs. Doing so will help your faction with the merchants. Doing it enough times will make you non kos to the merchants there as well as the knights of truth in freeport.<br>
<br>
Freeport &amp; Qeynos Factions<br>
-CoalitionofTradefolk<br>
-CoalitionofTradefolkIII<br>
-FreeportMilitia<br>
-CarsonMcabe<br>
-CorruptQeynos Guards<br>
<br>
To do this there is a letter delivery in the freeport tunnels. Near the rogues guild you ask the dwarf &quot;What message&quot; he will give you a note to give to an npc by the brownloe bakery in west freeport. Also ask the female dark elf about a message delivery to speed up the process. The messages go to 2 npcs in west freeport. When you deliver each of the messages you will not get the faction however each of them will give you a message to give back to original npc. When you return these messages you will gain the faction<br>
