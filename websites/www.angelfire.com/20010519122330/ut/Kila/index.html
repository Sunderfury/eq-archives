Kila was born in a town she doesnt remember by parents who tried but were still only an assasin and a thief.

<CENTER><FONT FACE="American-Uncial-Normal" SIZE="5" COLOR="#FFCC33">She grew up in Britain wrestling the ideals her parents set for her against the skills they taught her through example. Born from this struggle came a fluidity of thought. A Duality of Spirit. A conscience that dips into the dark and the light.

<CENTER><FONT FACE="American-Uncial-Normal" SIZE="5" COLOR="#FFCC33">She got to  test these loyalties in the town she picked to spend her young adulthood in. Trinsic. A mixed town. Soft and nuturing at times, but mostly harsh and unforgiving and even crude.

She was starting to depend too heavily on the skills she learned as a child, not stealing exactly, but chancing upon unscroupulous situations and taking full advantage of them. In this way she survived the days and nights in Trinsic.

<CENTER><FONT FACE="American-Uncial-Normal" SIZE="5" COLOR="#FFCC33">One day she chanced upon a pack horse on a visit to Britain. Not needing a pack horse as much as money for food, Kila attempted to sell the companionable beast. After many unsuccessful trips to various stabling houses, she spied a moongate opening up. Full of frusteration and her usual abandon she took a deep breath, held it, and rushed into the gate before it closed.

<CENTER><FONT FACE="American-Uncial-Normal" SIZE="5" COLOR="#FFCC33"> After the tingling subsided and the pony neighed  nervousely down her neck, she realized that  her eyes were squeezed shut. Kila opened them onto the streets of a foreign town. Vesper she was later told. It was here that her life changed forever.

In Vespar Kila met Getafix. Getafix took a hand to help her sell the pony. It was Getafix who introduced her to the others in The Black Tower Guild. And, a week later, Kila became a member of this guild. And they became her family.
