<A NAME=cargo> Cargo Clockwork: </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Jarah Reskar in the Gem Choppers Hall will tell you that the Cargo Clockwork goes from Ak Anon to the windmills every five days at 8 am.  A group of 3 highwaymen (it is rumored that one is Bugglegup) have been attacking it.  A reward is offered for the bandits' heads.  Zondo Hyzill in Steamfont is standing next to the Cargo Clockwork.

<A NAME=telescope>Telescope:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
At the observatory past the windmills in the Steamfonts a female gnome name Brona Frugrin is a telescope lens crafter and she believes that if you can get the retina of the beholder named Borxx, who may be found in either Runnyeye or Beholder at certain times, and return it to her, she can create a telescope unlike any other.  Borxx is a L30  Evil Eye-type monster.  Bringing back his loot, the evil eye lens, will yield an awesome 2h blunt weapon called the Staff of the Observers that has Attack 12, Attack Delay 39,  +5 INT, +5 WIS, +30 Mana.   It also casts the L8 Enchanter spell "Sentinel"  which will warn you of approaching hostiles which is very useful while meditating. (Submitted by Tothis, Wicca and Aoiryuu)

<A NAME=lenses>Telescope Lenses:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Tobon Starpyre, the Wizard Guildmaster, wants you to collect four spare telescope lenses from four observatories around the Steamfonts. He gives you a rolled up note with the names of the four Royal Observers, three of which are located in the Steamfont Mountains while the last is located in Lesser Faydark.  These are supposedly the four lense locations  1) The gnome royal observer just outside zone line in Lesser Faydark will give  you one if you ask.  2) The gnome royal observer in one of the observatories in Steamfont will also give you one if you ask  3) The gnome royal observer in another observatory tells you it was stolen by a Dark Elf female, Zenita DRin.  She is in Freeport in the secret tunnels beneath an inn by the docks. You can get the lense two ways.  Kill her - she is approximatley level 15 and hard to kill.  Or you can play cards with her (if you have an OK faction with her) by continuously trading her a bottle of something you can purchase upstairs for a draw of a card until you manage to draw a King.  (This one is confirmed)  4) The final royal observer in Steamfont tells you his brother, Bidl Frugrin, went to Kelethin to do some observations with the spare telescope lens.  He says he has likely found the local tavern and has gotten drunk, wandering the forest by day, and hanging out in the tavern by night.  At night, he can be found in the tavern next to Trueshot Bows in Kelethin and happily gives you the telescope lens. Take the lenses to Tobon Starpyre and give all four to him at once.  He will give you a level 8 spell (Fire bolt being one) and approx 1 pp.  Faction changes include +Eldritch Collective, -DarkReflection, -TheDead, +GemChoppers, +KingAkanon.
