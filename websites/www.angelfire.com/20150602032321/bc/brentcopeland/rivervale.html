<A NAME=bind>The Bind</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> Llscent Tagglefoot by the druids guild is in a bind.  He will say he needs somone to deliver a case of jumjum juice to Xanuusus a treant in the Northern Karanas Plains. Say "I will take the Jumjum Juice" and you will be provided with a case. Getting to Treant is a long walk.  Go to North Karana and follow the water to the right.  When you hit the mountains follow them and you will run right into him.  I have been told you no longer have to levitate to give him the jum jum juice.  Also, apparantly Xanuusus is not smart enough or just doesn't care to distinguish between the jum jum you get from Llscent and that you find from looting bixies.  Who's going to argue with a Treant?  So any case of jum jum juice will work.  Factions go up with StormReapers, MayorGubbin, and MerchantsofRiverVale, and went down with the UnkemptDruids.  You will also get some minor coin and a minor item.  Considering that bixies are very low level creatures and drop jum jum quite frequently, this may be a good way for low level characters to make some money (Assuming you survive the trek through N Karana).

<A NAME=stout>Blackburrow Stout</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>Hail Rueppy Kutpurse and she asks if you want something to drink. Ask her what she wants to drink and she says how about beer.  After you give her a beer, she says it's good, but not as good as blackburrow stout.  (But what is?)  Ask here about blackburrow stout and she responds that you can smuggle it.  If you then ask her about smuggling and she will ask you if you want a job.  Should you choose to accept, you have to go to the ruins on the other side of the great wall, find Gungrich, and tell him that Dark Rivers Flow East.  The ruins are the undead hill on the other side of the wall in Misty Thicket.  When you say this to Gunrich, he gives you a case of blackburrow stout.  Take the case back to Rueppy Kutpurse and she gives you some small change and experience.  (Submitted by Hazado)

<A NAME=shank>The Bloody Shank</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>:  Be warned that this quest can really mess with your faction with the deep pockets.  Visit the Captain standing out on a balcony in Highhold Keep. Hail him and answer his questions.  It seems a petty rogue escaped the dungeon in Highhold Keep but left behind crucial evidence. The rogue's bloody shank was sticking out of a guards back! The Captain gives you the shank to take to the rogue to let the rogue know why you are there to kill him. The rogue's name is Bronin Higginsbot and he hangs around the Deeppockets in Rivervale.  He may sometimes be found around the southernmost tower in Rivervale.  Killing him lowers faction with Deeppockets,  Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Trade Folk and Carson McCabe and raises it with Merchants of Rivervale. Return his head for decent money and experience.  You will raise faction with Highpass Guards, Carson McCabe, Merchants of Highpass, Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport Militia.  There is also a rogue named Shayde Higginsbot on the second floor of the Fool's Gold.  When you hand him the bloody shank he does not give the generic (Thank you.) response. Not sure what happens if you slay him too.  (Submitted by Ebaemnn o' the Rose and Kozmo)

<A NAME=chomper>Chomper</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> A female NPC on the second floor in the rogues guild (Fool's Gold building) wants you to prove yourself as the new dishwasher by finding a missing jewel that is inside of a fish named Chomper.  Chomper is a level 3 small aggressive fish that can be found in the water by the Rivervale docks.  He always spawns with a Large Ruby that you return for some faction, experience, and some silver.

<A NAME=tagil>Deputy Tagil's Debt</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>(Note that the deputy you go to has changed from Deputy Hhilltop)  Speak with Uner Gnarltrunk at Tagglefoot's Farmstead.  He will tell you that clumsy old Deputy Tagil stepped on some veggies and has forgotten to pay for them.   He will then send you to Tagil with note to remind him of his debt.  He is in Misty Thicket.   Give him note when you find him and he will give you payment which you need to take back to Uner for experience.  (Submitted by Ryanne)

<A NAME=fish>The Fishslayers</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> Talk to the Female Marshall in the first hall before the Sheriff and she will send you down to the lake to talk to the shopkeeper there, who I believe is named Fiddy Bobek, about his problem.  He tells you that there are piranha eating all of the fish in the lake.  He wants you to kill the piranha and bring him their teeth as proof.  He also mentions bringing one back to the Marshall to prove he's not crazy.  Well he isn't crazy, and there are indeed piranha in there.  Jump in and start killing piranha (be careful they tend to come in pairs  - and keep an eye on your air meter).  Each tooth gets you between one and two gold pieces -- real good money for a level 7 or 8 player.  They also have fish and scales as loot, so you can conceivably get more than 2 gold per fish.  Plus if you give him 4 at a time, you sometimes get an item.  You can also take the teeth back to the marshall, but that seems to be broken since she says she is giving you a bag to put them in, but you don't get anything in return.  She also is much stingier than Fiddy.  You get the following fation changes for each tooth:  MayorGubbin, merchantsofrivervale, deeppockets, guardiansofthevale all go up,  coalitionoftradesfolkIII goes down. <P>

Talk to Lil, and ask her about  the [Honey Jum Recipe].  She'll direct you to an NPC in Rivervale who owns the Herb Jar. (Just to the right of the Fool's Gold.)  This NPC will tell you  that she does, indeed, make Honey Jum, but not for free!  You must bring her 3 honeycombs and 5 gold.  Honeycombs are frequently found on Bixies and Bixie Drones.  You receive the following faction changes:  Merchants of Rivervale, Guardians of the Vale, Deep Pockets and Mayor Gubbin get better, Coalition of Tradesfolk III gets worse.

<A NAME=diggs>Kevlin Diggs Debt</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> Ace Slighthand, the casino owner on the second floor of the rogues guild wants you to collect payment from a welcher named Kevlin Diggs who is the town armorer.  Kevlin is friend's with the Mayor and has a mean dog named Mangler that guards his stash. In the back bedroom of Kevlin's shop on his bed is where a coin spawns that you have to get.  The hard part is getting past his dog that will attack you.  You can either sneak past the dog, or just run in and get the coin and run out quickly but making sure you DO NOT attack the dog. If you do attack the dog Kevlin and all the deputies will jump in and kill you.  Once you retrieve the coin return it to Ace and you will get some experience, faction, and some copper.

<A NAME=raiders>Leatherfoot Raiders</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> :  After you complete the leatherfoot quest, Marshall Anrey gives you a quest to retrieve a dragoon's dagger from a dark elf dragoon.  There are two Dark Elf Dragoons running around the West Commonlands.  One is called Kizdean Gix,  and I believe he is some kind of warrior class, approx. L20-25  Another is a Necromancer or Shadow Knight named Dragoon Zytl, who is closer to 30.  Killing one of these two sometimes yields a dagger.  You can also get a dagger by killing D'Vinn in Crushbone or any of the various dark elf dragoon guards in Nektulos.  Turn it in to Marshal Anrey and he will reward you with a Leatherfoot Raider Skullcap.  Note that the dagger has recently been updated and is now a very good weapon in its own right.  I imagine very few people would trade a dragoon dagger for this hat.   (Submitted by Aoiryuu)

<A NAME=nillipus>Nillipus the Brownie</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> Reebo Leefsway wants you to teach Nillipus a lesson for stealing Jumjum. You must hunt the evil brownie down and slay him who is approx level 17.  He gives good experience and alot of gold as well as the stolen Jumjum stalks. Return 4 of these stalks (give them 1 at a time) to Reebo to complete the quest.  You may have to kill him several times and really teach him a lesson to acquire 4 stalks (the number may vary depending upon your faction).  Your reward is faction, experience, platinum, and a random magic item.  The item you get varies a lot.  Some of the items you may get are:  Regular Lightstone;  Travelers Pouch (very nice, but small bag);  Earring of Fire Reflection (+5 sv Fire, AC1);  Earring of Magic Reflection (+5 sv Magic, AC1);  Earring of Poison Reflection (+5 sv Poison, AC1);  Earring of Disease Reflection (+5 sv Poison, AC1);  Runners Ring (+2 agility, +2 stamina [not SoW]), Wand of Frost Bolts, Rod of Identification . Keep doing the quest and eventually you might get some really good stuff, like a ring that speeds you up like a SoW or Selo's Accelerando when worn.  For that reason, many people hunt the filching brownie, so expect lots of competition.  He likes to run around the main roundabout in town around Fool's Gold and down the passage by Meeka Diggs.

<A NAME=rebo>Rebo's Carrots</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> Outside Tagglefoot's Farmstead in the garden is Reebo Leafsway.  If you talk to him he will eventually ask you to deliver a crate of carrots to Blinza Toepapal at the Fool's Gold.  Should you choose to be his errand boy/girl, be warned he's not very trustworthy.  The first crate he gives you has rotten carrots, if you take that to Blinza she will give it back and your faction will go down.  You can still take it back for the good carrots, but if you immediately return it to Reebo you will get the good crate which you can then take to Blinza for exp and copper and a lead into another quest (Jillin's Stew)  (Submitted by Ryanne)

<A NAME=head>Shakey the Scarecrow's Head</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> :  At the Tagglefoot farm, hail Shakey the Scarecrow, and one of the Leafsway NPCs will comment that Shakey isn't  himself lately.  There are two quests out of this:  the head and the stuffing.  The druid tells you that they have no  idea what can be done to fix Shakey's head, and asks you to [research] the problem.  There is an NPC on the top floor of the Erudin Library who has a document on the creation of Scarecrows, and she's willing to let you have a  peek for the mere pittance of 2 platinum.  When you give her the 2 pp she gives you a copy of a page torn out of a book and tells you that a female Teir'Dal (dark elf) was the first person to create a scarecrow head.  From the information on the page it sounds like she is trapped in Mistmoore.

<A NAME=stuffing>Shakey the Scarecrow's Stuffing</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> At the Tagglefoot farm, hail Shakey the Scarecrow, and one of the Leafsway NPCs will comment that Shakey isn't  himself lately.  There are two quests out of this:  the head and the stuffing. It seems Shakey's stuffing is rather old, and his pumpkin head is beginning to crack.   To fix his stuffing, you need magical hay.  The Magical Hay that must be harvested can only be found in the Plains of Karana.  If you travel to the corn fields of West Karana and kill some Scarecrows there, you may sometimes get some magic hay for loot.  I have laso been told that Cleet Miller will drop bails of hay as he wanders his field.  Next, you are required to obtain a Flask of the Blessed Oil of Life.  How to obtain this is detailed in The Blessed Oil Quest in W Karana.  Now comes the very hardest part.  You must have the hay cursed by the High Priest of Cazic-Thule named Roror, who lives in the Feerrott.  Hail him and say 'Bless my hay' or 'Curse my hay' he will tell you he wants 66 gold to bless the hay. Give him the 66 gold and hay at the same time, he will give you back a sack of cursed hay.  After the hay is cursed, you must find a forge, such as you would use to make armor, and combine the cursed hay with the blessed oil of life and you will get a sack of writhing hay.  You must have a good blacksmithing skill to so this.  Then give the result to Shakey and you will receive a pretty nice item (Wee Harvester or Belt of the River).  (Submitted by Thoringar). <P>

<A NAME=ring>The Wall Squad Ring</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>This quest involves gaining at a lot of faction points (the exact number is unknown and depends on your starting faction) through whatever method you can use.  You gain the points doing most Rivervale quests including: Giving Runnyeye Warbeads to Sheriff Rogilo (worth 1 point each necklace), giving Deathfist Slashed Belt to Deputy Budo (worth approximately 5 points each belt), killing goblins (worth 1-3 points),  killing Mooto (he is worth around 20 points), or just killing lots and lots of goblins. Once you achieve enough faction points you ask Marshal Ghobber who is located on the bottom floor of the bank, "Am I one with the Wall?" you will receive a Squad Ring (charged with an 80 hp healing spell).  The ring can be recharged by a female cleric in Rivervale, but you need a different faction to get it recharged.  It is also a no drop lore item.  You can, however, complete this quest multiple times. (Submitted by Kozmo)  <P>
