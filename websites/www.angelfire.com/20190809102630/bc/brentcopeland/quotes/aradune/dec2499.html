<FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial">posted 12-24-1999 02:05 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</FONT><HR>(I'm reposting this -- it was originally at the end of a long thread and was a response to another post.  Some players started to respond to it by breaking down their opinions on the various zones, which I think is a great idea and will help us deal with these issues)<P>I will attempt to address this issue by answering your questions:<P>&gt;1) Does Verant think the servers are overcrowded during peak hours?<P>Some servers are over peak population targets (for example, Fenin Ro). Unfortunately, new players continue to start on Fenin for a variety of  reasons. Also, and more importantly, some Zones on all servers are over crowded. To me, this is the more important issue. Why are some Zones less populated? Why do many people prefer the more populated zones, play there, and then complain about over crowded servers? What could we do to attract players to some of the lesser used zones? These are the questions that I think need to be answered, and we'd love some feedback. It is a fact that many zones, even on the more populated servers, are underutilized and have room, while others are more than full. I think we can do some things to help (for example, re-tune dungeons, adjust loot levels/types, etc.) and I think the players can do something<BR>about it too (make an effort to explore/use dungeons and other zones that are less populated, even if they are farther away, or you perceive they have less loot, or they are more challenging).<P>&gt;2) Is the game playable within their original design ideas based upon REAL WORLD server populations, as opposed to pre-release and design-doc server projections during these peak times?<P>The game is extremely playable, even on the more crowded servers, especially IF you make an effort to play in areas that aren't as crowded. I know that's what I and my guild do. Does it take longer? Yes, sometimes. Is it more dangerous? Sure, but we like the challenge. Is the loot not as good? Depends. And again, we (Verant) have been and will continue to tune existing dungeons, especially the underutilized ones, to draw more people to them. (Kerra Ridge is next, btw, after we launch the Plane of Sky. Then we'll launch Paineel, which has newbie areas, and then the Hole, which is a high level dungeon).<P>&gt;3) If a player feels they are wasting time by playing on an overcrowded server, what options do they have? Start over on a new server? Be transferred? Wait for the expansion?<P>We have no intention of allowing general character transfers between servers, and in any case, I don't think that would address the issue people are complaining about at all. I really don't. And even if it were helpful, the problems it would add in my opinion far outweigh the benefits.<P>My answer for a player who feels he or she is wasting time in a crowded area is to MOVE to other zones, wait for us to revamp and re-tune more existing zones, and wait for the Expansion which will increase the size of the world by around a third. Unfortunately, though, if enough players refuse to leave their comfort zone (say, bottom Guk) to head out and explore the Expansion and/or the revamped older zones, the problem won't totally go away.<P>&gt;4) Verant has taken steps to lessen the impact of overcrowding (Paw, Rare NPCs in open areas of zones that use to be un-utilized, bumping up Kithicor's Level, and itemizing/populating Kedge Keep). Does Verant think these moves (among others) has<P>A) Fixed the overcrowding issue (assuming there was one)?<BR>B) Help alleviate overcrowding?<BR>C) Help it a bit, but still hasn't solved the issue?<P>I'd choose B - it's helped, but many players continue to stay in their comfort zones, choosing the path of least resistance, and therefore continue to deal with the crowds. <P>&gt;Basically, I just think the people want to know your straight answer as to whether or not this is the way the game was envisioned and meant to be played in your eyes?<P>No, the vision (as it relates to your question) was that people would spread out more and 'do' a dungeon and then move on, as opposed to repeatedly camping spots they are used to camping. We will continue to address this issue as I've detailed in this posting as well as brainstorm on better designs that will hopefully alleviate some of this issue in the future (yes, that's purposely vague).<P>&gt;Is Verant waiting to see how the Expansion "helps" overcrowding (assuming there is a problem), and thus, REACT to overcrowding issues, or are you going to PRO-ACTIVELY approach overcrowding as a major issue and put into effect sweeping changes to alleviate these concerns?<P>I believe we are both waiting for the Expansion AND pro-actively tweaking zones. We also just launched another server. But as for 'sweeping changes', no, we're not going to make any sweeping changes to EverQuest. While the game has some issues and certainly its share of flaws, on the whole it is both the game we envisioned as well as the most successful online game of all time. Making sweeping changes to a successful game would be foolish at best. That said, you have my commitment that we will continue to address problems such as zone overcrowding (as well as many other problems) both in the EQ of today, the Expansion, and the future beyond.<P>-Brad<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#ff9900" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#003333">
