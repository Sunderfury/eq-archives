I've gone through a collection of EQ related material that i have collected from the web over the past year and present them to you now. You may have seen these already, and if not then prepare to laugh your arse off. There are some really funny and creative stuff here, just goes to show what a little free time and a good sense of humor can create. Enjoy.

I'd like everyone to know that This is the first day that the Comedy page has  
been running.  Anyone who would like to submit their own humorous events send 
them to stormwardensubmits@dragonsworn.com  eventually this page should fill
up and we can all laugh at one joke at least.  Anyway here is the first one.
