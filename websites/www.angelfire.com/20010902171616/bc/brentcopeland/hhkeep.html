<A NAME=shank>
Bloody Shank:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
:  Be warned that this quest can really mess with your faction with the deep pockets.  Visit the Captain standing out on a balcony in Highhold Keep. Hail him and answer his questions.  It seems a petty rogue escaped the dungeon in Highhold Keep but left behind crucial evidence. The rogue's bloody shank was sticking out of a guards back! The Captain gives you the shank to take to the rogue to let the rogue know why you are there to kill him. The rogue's name is Bronin Higginsbot and he hangs around the Deeppockets in Rivervale.  He may sometimes be found around the southernmost tower in Rivervale.  Killing him lowers faction with Deeppockets,  Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Trade Folk and Carson McCabe and raises it with Merchants of Rivervale. Return his head for decent money and experience.  You will raise faction with Highpass Guards, Carson McCabe, Merchants of Highpass, Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport Militia.  There is also a rogue named Shayde Higginsbot on the second floor of the Fool's Gold.  When you hand him the bloody shank he does not give the generic (Thank you.) response. Not sure what happens if you slay him too.  (Submitted by Ebaemnn o' the Rose and Kozmo)

<A NAME=eye>
Eye of Stormhammer:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
This is the quest for the Avenger Battle Axe.  After returning the clockwork remains (Cleaner clockwork quest) to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him about the Eye of Stormguard. He will give you a letter to give to the Jail clerk near the bank of High Pass keep.  Of course the prisoner has escaped but she does give you part of the eye of stormguard, as well as info that "Bronin" has the other part, the "Emerald Shard".  Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes found in Rivervale and sometimes near the southern tower in Misty Thicket.  When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he says he will give it to you if you do a small favor.  Apparently a bounty hunter by the name of Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body, he will give you the emerald.  Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket.  He appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)!  He hops around between the Orc camp and the wall.  You may have to talk to Bronin to get him to spawn.  If you defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore item), a few gold, and the following faction adjustments:  Frogloks of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp Giants of Kurnak and Iskar get better.  When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells you that he put the emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes... and gives you a key to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold.  The key is labeled H.K.106. Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and the following faction adjustments:  Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of River Vale gets worse.  When you turn in the key in highpass bank, you get the emerald shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience, and the following adjustments: Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson McCabe all get better.   Bronin also says "There is a [second Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will need it..."  Upon further questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the Gem of Tunare, and is being held by a guild in Kelethin.  In Kelethin, go to the Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about the Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The only one who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting "at the lake near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to Dagnor's Cauldron and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his brother is a thief (and only his half brother btw...) and that he has gone to Qeynos, probably to work for the thieves guild there.  Faldor Hendrys is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he can be found walking out the front gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills zone sometimes. You need to kill him to get the gem.   Combine the parts and you get the eye of stormguard, which gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection.   If you give it to Beno, he gives you a long speach about how wonderful a warrior you are and says he is giving you a "warrior's true weapon designed by the ancient stormguard hero, Jendl Mizebrite."  He then will give you the Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice warrior only 2HS weapon.  It is likely that you need to have a very high faction with him to get the axe.

Captain Bosec will pay between 1 and 5 gold for each left goblin ear you turn over to him. You also get 4 or 5 faction adjustments (all positive but one), and a small amount of experience. He generally stands close to the entrance of the cellars, near the bank.  (Submitted by Scruf)

<A NAME=lenia>
Princess Lenia:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
(All Classes)  In the basement of High keep is a prisoner named Princess Lenia.  The princess of Felwithe has been taken prisoner by Carson McCabe (ruler of Highhold Keep).   She would like you to help her escape - a reasonable request.  First, visit a Tearon.  He is located near the front of  the Keep.  Pay close attention to the name of his princess.  Next, seek out the REAL Princess.  She is located on the top floor of Highhold Keep, behind an illusionary door.  Hail her and answer her questions.  You are eventually told to provide her with proof as to your reason for freeing her.  You must visit Tearon for this proof.   When you talk to Tearon, tell him you know where his princess is and he'll give you a bracer to give to her. The bracer is Weight 5, with no other stats, and can't be worn.  When you give it to the Princess (as proof), she says thanks, vanishes (for about half a second), and you get XP and the following faction: KingTearisThex (Felwithe King)+, FaydarkChampions+, MayongMistmoore-, RingofScale-, KingAythoxThex- (???...hmm, could this be continuing somewhere?).  She also gives you the bracer, which is now AC 1 but which still can't be worn. When you give the bracer back to Tearon, you get more xp, and this faction: ClericsofTunare+, KingTearisThex+, Anti-Mage+.  He then gives you an amulet to take back to Princess Lenya (who was supposed to have vanished), but all she says when she accepts it is "the quest is in fact broken there."  However, when you give the bracer to the fake Princess, she reveals herself to be a dark elf, and gives the following faction: CarsonMcCabe+, CoalitionofTradesfolk+, HighpassGuards+, MerchantsofHighpass+, RingofScale-, but no XP. She then attacks you, so you have better be careful.  I have been told sometimes she kills herself in this attack and other times she casts a maga spell which can kill you fast.    There is more to this quest, and the rumor is it gets you a pretty nice item, but I don't have any further details.  (Submitted by Baroah and Ebaemnn o' the Rose)

<A NAME=strongbox>
Strongbox:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
The banker in Highpass hold says she will clear out old strongbox accounts if given the key. The key is gained from an npc named Hollis, who is located in East Karana.  He is roughly level.  Attacking him also draws his cronies bandits so I suggest a team approach or a level 25 to 30 individual.   If you kill him, you get a staff segment (a lore item) and a Highkeep Strongbox Key.  When you give her the key she gives you a few gold,a little experience and a faction adjustment plus one more staff segment.  If you then talk to Lady McCabe on the top floor and she said "hmmm, a battle staff? It does not ring a bell."  There is obviously some way to combine the staff segments, but this is all I have so far.  The general consensus is that you need to get something from Carson McCabe to make this work, but nobody has gotten farther than this.

<A NAME=book>
Testament of Vanear</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
If you go talk to Rarnan Lapice on the top floor of the temple of divine light in Erudin, he will tell you to fetch a book from the library. This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest.   The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last checked it out.  When you ask him, he tells you that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.  He tells you to go talk to his sister who is in the Erudin Palace.  Once there, she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.  When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive.  Her brother is at Crows  (It seems he is sick and is in need of some Erud's Tonic.  This is a side quest).  Ask him about The Testament of Vanear.  He says yes he has it and will sell it to me for 2 gold.  If you give him the 2 gold he gives you the book which has to inventory slots and a combine button in it.   He then laughs and tells you that a thief stole pages 30 and 34 and the book is worthless without them.  He also says that the thief sold the pages to someone named Ran.  If you then ask him who Ran is he tells you that Ran Flamespinner is a librarian in Highpass.  If you go to Highpass and ask about The Testament of Vanear he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in Highpass, because he could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a hidden camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dynil Fireshine. Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport).  Beware that any smugglers around him will come to his aid.  Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard, +Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers)After going back to Qeynos, I went back to Moodoro and said I want page 34.   He said ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty smart of me to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I get it because the work is fiction anyway.  He then offers to play a game with you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card is a jester he will give you the page.  Along with the jester, you might also draw the King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight.   [Note - keep the Knights and give them to the dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward].  Once the whole thing is combined you get the Testament of Vanear, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is a no drop lore item, <B>CAN BE USED NOW</B>.  Return the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum.  Of course, if they ever activate the testament it will be worth far more on the open market.  (Submitted by Aadon)
