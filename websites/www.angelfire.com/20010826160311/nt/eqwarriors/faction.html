This section is to help anyone(mostly warriors) find the best way to raise their faction with different cities. Easy enough methods that a warrior can handle it solo.
<P>
I haven't really raised my faction with all the cities so it will be incomplete until I've tried some or someone sends something in to add.
<P>
Experience based on playing an agnostic troll warrior.

<BR>
Most of Firiona Vie is tied to one faction which makes it easy to raise.
<P>
The easiest way to gain this faction is to kill kunark goblins, very low level goblins that die in one swing with a good 2 hand weapon. These can be found in Warsliks Woods and Lake of Ill Omen not far outside Cabilis, Warsliks having a higher concentration of them in one area.
<P>
Be careful not to get too close to the edge of Cabilis or you might find an Iksar trooper ripping you a new one.
<P>
*You will also gain Legion of Cabilis faction killing these goblins, see Cabilis section if you want to be able to bank, etc in Cabilis. There are some points to consider before you slaughter too many goblins*
<P>
When in Firiona Vie stay away from the dock area where the barbarians are(if you're a dark race), these are not on FV faction.

Cabilis is made up of 6 faction groups: <B>Legion of Cabilis</B>(warrior/troopers), <B>Cabilis Residents</B>(merchants/bankers), <B>Crusaders of Greenmist</B>(shadowknights/crusaders), <B>Swift Tails</B>(monks(, <B>Scaled Mystics</B>(shamans), and <B>Brood of Kotiz</B>(necromancers).
<P>
*<B>Important</B>: as soon as you reach dubious to the Iksar troopers you must start the bonechip quest outlined below. This is because certain race/deity combinations start with much lower faction with some of the iksar guilds. The bonechip quest will have a cap to how much faction you can gain and if you do not reach dubious to Crusader Quarg by the time you reach this cap then you may be out of luck, I do not know of any other way to raise that faction easily.
<P>
You can get dubious to Iksar troopers by killing either sarnaks or kunark goblins, however goblins also raise Firiona Vie faction and you might reach dubious to FV at the same time as the troopers which will allow you to bank in FV for the time being.
<P>
Once you reach dubious to Iksar troopers head over to Kurns Tower in Field of Bone or any other spot where you can get a LOT of bonechips (this will take many bags of bonechips). Kurns Tower is the most convenient place because of it's location.
<P>
There is a Trooper Mozo standing just outside the gate of Cabilis in Field of Bone, you hand him 4 stacks of 4 bonechips at a time to raise all but the necromancer faction in cabilis(per stack).
<P>
"But Zarec.. what about those mean red Crusaders wandering about near the trooper? they scare me"
<P>
oh yeah.. that's the tricky part :)   at last check there were only 2 crusaders, they patrol the whole paved section outside cabilis entrance.
<BR>
They start in the opening behind the troopers leading to cabilis and roam along the edge and through buildings then back down the path to their starting location.
<BR>
Approximate timing of their patrol from start to finish is about 9 minutes, they stay in their starting location for 4-6 minutes before going on patrol again. Watch them carefully to get to Trooper Mozo safely and back out. I never died once doing this :)
<BR>
Option 1 is to quickly feed as many stacks of 4 bonechips(remember 4 stacks at a time) to Trooper Mozo in the 4-6 minute window and retreat before the Crusaders go on patrol, however this makes it difficult and the Crusaders might not even leave and return in sync making it even harder.
<P>
Option 2 is to stand behind Trooper Mozo in the corner by that lamp thing right up against the wall.
<BR>
SLOWLY take tiny steps forward until you are able to hand Trooper Mozo the stacks of bonechips(you're not close enough if you're right in the corner behind the lamp).
<BR>
You should be able to give as many stacks as you want from this location WHILE the Crusaders walk past.. this is the method I used.. it was quite unnerving to have some red at level 48 shadowknight go walking past you repeatedly at that distance without turning me into a bloodstain on the ground, but it MUCH easier to give lots of bonechips without interuption.
<BR>
I will get a couple screenshots put here to show where I was standing to hand in bonechips while Crusader faction was still below dubious.
<P>
Note: I did this over a month ago, it should still be the same unless aggro range or pathing of the Crusaders have been changed recently.
<P>
If you are agnostic then bankers, crusaders should turn dubious at the same time. Crusader Quarg in field of bone is a strange one.. I've read that for some race/deity combos even when other Crusaders are already dubious, Crusader Quarg was still threateningly or lower.. he was dubious to me at the same time other crusaders turned dubious however.
<BR>
If you're not agnostic I've heard it takes alot more bonechips to get banker faction up to dubious even after Crusaders turned dubious.
<P>
Once you've got all your factions to dubious or higher through bonechips then you can start working on Iksar necromancer faction. This is fairly easy, all you need to do is kill iksar marauders, manslayers, bandits to raise it. You can easily just avoid the necromancer guild as well(what I do).
<P>
This guide may not work for everyone, I haven't seen any other races inside Cabilis yet but I rarely go there also.
<BR>
If you're higher than dubious to Iksar Troopers(spend alot of time in Sebilis, or killing goblins and sarnaks) then it is probably too late to raise other factions high enough before Legion of Cabilis caps out on bonechips.

Basically just kill a lot of orcs or gnolls on either side of Highpass Hold, you will eventually be able to enter town and Highpass Keep to bank.
