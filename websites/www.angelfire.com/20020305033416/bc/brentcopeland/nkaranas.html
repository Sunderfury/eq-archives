<A NAME=bind> The Bind:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Llscent Tagglefoot by the druids guild is in a bind.  He will say he needs somone to deliver a case of jumjum juice to Xanuusus a treant in the Northern Karanas Plains. Say "I will take the Jumjum Juice" and you will be provided with a case. Getting to Treant is a long walk.  Go to North Karana and follow the water to the right.  When you hit the mountains follow them and you will run right into him.  I have been told you no longer have to levitate to give him the jum jum juice.  Also, apparantly Xanuusus is not smart enough or just doesn't care to distinguish between the jum jum you get from Llscent and that you find from looting bixies.  Who's going to argue with a Treant?  So any case of jum jum juice will work.  Factions go up with StormReapers, MayorGubbin, and MerchantsofRiverVale, and went down with the UnkemptDruids.  You will also get some minor coin and a minor item.  Considering that bixies are very low level creatures and drop jum jum quite frequently, this may be a good way for low level characters to make some money (Assuming you survive the trek through N Karana).

<A NAME=guards> Corrupt Guards:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Capt. Linarius at the top of the bridge tower on the edge of the Northern Plains of Karana wants you do help him root out corruption among the guards.  He will ask you to seek out and find any corrupt guards, to kill them and bring back their guard bracelets to him.  Now there is a guard tower located between the river and the valley which leads to Qeynos Hills on the Northern Plains, it's near the mountains. In this guard tower is a guard named Guard Donlan.  When you talk to Donlan you discover that he is charging people a travel tax of 1 gp to travel on the roads.  Kill him and return his bracelet for experience, faction, some money and a minor item.

Mrysila in the gypsy camp has a quest for good magic users. Give her a lightstone and she will give you either Runes & Research Volume I or Runes & 
Research Volume II.  Be warned that what you get is random and not dependant upon which one you already have.  I got two volume ones for my two lightstones.  For a greater lightstone she will give you the Concordance of Research, which is what you use to combine the ingredients to get the practice runes.  The research materials are (or will soon be) posted on Mithiran Tower. [Thanks Wester Windwolf for helping me on this quest]. (Submitted by Washoo)

This is another of the multiple part quests. When heading into Southern Karana, from Northern Karana mind you, there is a tower just before the bridge. Just outside the tower doors are four very large horn like structures. Standing beside one is a female bard. If you talk to her, and ask if there is anything you can do for her, she relays a sad story of a hermit who stole her flute. Now, head into Southern Karana. Head straight south, making sure to give a wide berth to the Grave Yard of Lord Grimrot. About half way through the zone is a fountain, with Vhalen standing there. Vhalen, who is also the object of the broken Lute quest for bards, has an offer for you. He will complete his latest masterpiece for you. Of course, he needs something for this. Two sheets of a song. Pages 1 and 2 of the Winds of Karana. He tells you of a man who has stolen these pages. A vile man of a Hermit. Sound familiar eh? Now, head southeast till you see a cottage. It has a hexagonal wall of stone surrounding it, so it's not hard to find. Inside the walls is "a hermit." A very unfriendly sort. Here's where the quests takes one of two paths. The door to the hermits house is either locked, or broken and won't open. So it's hard to get to him. If you slide past the door slowly you may be able to see him and target him. Now, if you want to talk to him, you can go behind the house, stand EXACTLY against the chimney that protrudes and banter with him. He's very hard to convince to talk, and the sentence basically has to say something to the effect of "where is the flute" though this isn't the exact wording, (I got it right once out of 6 attempts) Now, if you do talk to him, he has twoquests you can achieve from him (More on these later) in which you kill two people and bring proof to him for the Flute and the Page. Now, as it's hard to get through the door, and thus hard to exchange the items to him, there is ONE other manner to do this quest. Target him, as before, and begin an attack. Spells will draw him out just fine. After he is dead, his body will contain the Flute, Page 1 of the Winds of Karana or just one or the other. At this point, some factions will go up, down and you will no doubt gain some good experience. I estimate him to be around level 19-20. Now, head back into Northern Karana, and hand the flute over to the bard sitting against the pillar. She, as thanks, will give you Page 2 of the winds of Karana, some experience, faction and occasionally a small cash reward.  You are almost complete. Head back into Southern Karana and hand both the pages to Vhalen at the same time. You will gain Faction, a small amount of money, and a Bard song. This song appears to be random. I got the 3rd song, another got the 4th song.  (Submitted by Myen).
