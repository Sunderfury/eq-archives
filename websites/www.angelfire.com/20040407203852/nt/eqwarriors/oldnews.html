Put up a link to the screenshot area. Still needs content however :)
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:zarec@angelfire.com">Send</A> in those pics! (jpg format)
<P>
Angelfire.com has been a little slow lately.. not sure if it's me or angelfire.
<P>
<B><U><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Thursday, September 07, 2000</FONT></U></b>
<P>
Small update to <A HREF="1hslash.html">1H Slash</A> section.
<P>
Added: Jagged Long Sword, Jagged Blade of Mourning
<P>
<U><B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Wednesday, September 06, 2000</FONT></b></U>
<P>
Sorry for the lack of updates but no screenshots have been sent in yet, I wanted to get that section up sooner but don't really have very many interesting screenshots of my own.
<P>
In the meantime I've put together a faction guide... it's incomplete since I haven't tried to gain faction all over the place. There are only a few towns included so far but more will be added later, either by player submission or when I try to gain faction with that town and take down notes :)
<P>
<B><U><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Friday, September 01, 2000</FONT></U></b>
<P>
Twig wasn't nerfed last patch.. looks like next patch *sigh*
<P>
Made a small update to the <A HREF="armor2.htm">Armor</A> section. (added no drop list)
<P>
<B><U><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Tuesday, August 29, 2000</FONT></U></b>
<P>
If you do decide to send in a screenshot please make sure it's in JPG format. 
<P>
Unless you want the text box included or any other part of the screenshot for that matter then say so.. otherwise I will probably just crop out the main view area to put online(saves space :). Name in top right corner, chat area, group names, etc will be removed, or moved into the picture(some blank sky area maybe) unless specified otherwise.
<P>
Of course credit for the screenshot will be added underneath along with any caption sent with the screenshot.
<P>
Looking for humorous shots or other neat ones mainly. ex: that mile long train you swear you didn't start, strange corpse positions, that really close fight, stats to brag about, etc. (see examples below)
<P>
<B><U><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Tuesday, August 29, 2000</FONT></U></b>
<P>
I've been trying to figure out how I'm going to do the quest section and just what to include in it.
<P>
There are already complete spoiler sites you can go to for the full details of a quest so I was thinking of just including the quest starting NPC and location, small hints, and reward + faction increases. (I'm also lazy and did you see the amount of typing required for the Langseax quests? *grin*)
<P>
I will also not post spoiler screenshots without warning.. I like to see things for the first time in game not knowing what to expect.. you know.. adventuring into the unknown kind of thing. Seeing Vox up close in game is more exciting than a small low quality screenshot somewhere. :)   this goes for all other big named monsters.
<P>
There will probably be a seperate section for those kind of screenshots with a big spoiler warning.
<P>
a couple examples of screenshots can be found <A HREF="screenshots/ex.html">here</A>.
<P>
I have no reference book for HTML or much knowledge of it either. I look stuff up on the web when needed, this is why updates are slow going(figuring out how to make something look and function the way I want it to).
<P>
I also notice that most sites don't have frames but instead use tables for page layout or something other than frames.
<BR>
Personally I like frames and this site is designed to look ok at 800x600 resolution and higher using Internet Explorer. If anyone doesn't like the framesetup I use or there is something wrong with it then let me know.
<BR>
(thinking of how I can include non-framed site in the future)
<P>
If anyone has a good link to HTML tag reference, design tips, etc.. please post it on the <A HREF="http://pub22.ezboard.com/beqwarriors">message board</A> or send me an <A HREF="mailto:zarec@angelfire.com">email</A> :)

To anyone getting really laggy transitions to inventory screen from full screen this may help, just play using the default screen setting(640x480 with small window).
<P>
yeah yeah I know it sucks but the transition to inventory doesn't lag this way. I can't wait until they fix this problem.. it's really annoying.
<P>

I've tried deleting opt files, installing all the latest drivers, etc.. nothing works to get EQ stable.. although all my other games are running nicely. Feel free to post your experiences with the latest patch on the <A HREF="http://pub22.ezboard.com/beqwarriors">message board</A> :)

First try at image map for <A HREF="armor3.htm">armor</A> section is now up.. please let me know if that page is messed up.
<P>
What is SHOULD look like is the image with clickable spots on the left and the table on the right so you can access non-visible armor sections.
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:zarec@angelfire.com">Email</A> or post on <A HREF="http://pub22.ezboard.com/beqwarriors">message board</A> any errors on the page.
<P>
<B><U><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Friday, August 18, 2000</FONT></U></b>
<P>
<A HREF="armor.html">Armor section</A> is now up.
<P>
Quest section will probably take awhile.. going to try to find out how I can make it one big list so when you click on "South Karana Quest" in the armor sections for crafted armor it knows where to take you. This way I won't have to make a lot of seperate files for each quest.
<P>
BTW if you don't close the pop up but just leave it in the background while on the page then it shouldn't pop up again. If you keep closing it then each subsection you click on will just make it pop up.
<BR>
Works for me at least.. pops up once.. leave it in back ground and it stays there.
<P>
I don't have netscape to test the page with so if any netscape users out there want to let me know if something is not displaying right then drop me an <A HREF="mailto:zarec@angelfire.com">Email</A> or post on the <A HREF="http://pub22.ezboard.com/beqwarriors">message board</A>.
<P>
<U><B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Thursday, August 17, 2000</FONT></b></U>

Got a new redirect URL address without the 2nd pop up :)
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.eqwarriors.cjb.net/" TARGET="_blank">http://www.eqwarriors.cjb.net/</A> can also be used now even if the angelfire address changes.
<P>
<U><B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Thursday, August 17, 2000</FONT></b></U>
<P>
Finished up armor sections, I just have to put together a menu for it still. I'm also trying to figure out how to do an image map.
<BR>
I'll probably put the armor section up soon with or without the image map thing.
<P>
<U><B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Tuesday, August 15, 2000</FONT></b></U>

Created new <A HREF="http://pub22.ezboard.com/beqwarriors">Message board</A> to replace the old ones. Post lots! :)
<P>
<U><B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Tuesday, August 15, 2000</FONT></b></U>
<P>
I'm still working on the armor sections. Thinking of putting in an image with clickable spots to see the armor available for that section.. just as soon as I figure out how the image map thing works :).
<P>
I will probably put the tables up sooner if I can't get that idea working right. The tables are similar to the weapon tables(see <A HREF="head.htm">here</A> for example)
<P>
Emailed the EZboard help desk to see if they can fix those broken forums, if nothing is done I'll probably end up making another board(if possible).
<P>
Looked around at other web hosts and so far they're all the same(inline ads which screw up frames or pop up). IF I do change addresses I'll put a forwarding URL here or you can use <A HREF="http://go.to/eqwarriors" target="_blank">http://go.to/eqwarriors</A> which will forward you to whatever is the current address for the site at any time. You will get a 2nd pop up for using the go.to address but that only comes up once ;)   so just use <A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/nt/eqwarriors/" target="_blank">http://www.angelfire.com/nt/eqwarriors/</A> normally.
<P>

2h Blunt page added to weapons section.
<P>
I tried changing preferences to get rid of the pop up but it put a banner in the sidebar, counter box, and main window.. that didn't look very good :P  so pop up banner for now unless I can figure out how to get the banner to only show in one box or find another site that's a little more flexible.
<P>
Let me know if something isn't displaying right also. The page was designed with 800x600 resolution in mind.
<P>
<U><B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Friday, August 11, 2000</FONT></b></U>
<P>
What I plan for this page is a place to find info about warriors and equipment for warriors, mostly equipment that a warrior will use(no rusty stuff). I will also add a quest section for warrior items.
<P>
I would like the message board to be the main part of this page but I still need to fix that :)
<P>
I am still an HTML newbie so I will be keeping the page layout simple while easy to read/navigate.
<BR>
Any tips or advice how to work something is welcome.. just drop me an <A HREF="mailto:zarec@angelfire.com">email</A>
<P>
Still have been unable to find a better place for the page(that doesn't have annoying banners appended to my main page). I would rather have a pop up instead of the pages all messed up.. but would also rather not have any pop up at all.
<P>
Not much of a newshound but will try to update the main page every now and then with something if it directly affects warriors
<P>
Updated equipment pages will be uploaded later today.
<P>
<U><B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Friday, August 11, 2000</FONT></b></U>
<P>
heh.. LONG time since I updated :)
<P>
I sort of lost interest in the page when no one sent in much feedback or item submissions. BUT I guess I was expecting too much too soon. I will be gathering much of the armor stats on my own so I can put something together.
<P>
I've been working on the equipment pages and have most of the <A HREF="weapons.html">weapon</A> categories done, armor sections still a ways off but I'll get around to it.
<P>
The equipment sections can probably do without all the little screen captions that take up space(unless you really want them).. I was thinking of putting up a screenshot section instead. Screenshots can be anything from that huge crippling blow you like to brag about, funny shots, close calls, etc. Limited space as always so send them in jpg format.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://server3.ezboard.com/bwarriorsarena">message board</A> using <A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/" target="_blank">EZboard</A> has broken forums(no idea what's wrong with it). I will put a link to a temporary board for now at <A HREF="http://www.gamers.com/" target="_blank">gamers.com</A> until I can get the EZboard one fixed(I like EZboard).
<P>

<P>
Sorry for lack of updates, I haven't been getting much feedback or item submissions at all(like 1-2  a week).
<P>
Site might have to move soon, something about Angelfire requiring ad banners and I'm not sure if I want one put on automatically or anything. I'll look into it more first.
<P>
<U><B>Wednesday, October 20, 1999</b></U>
<P>
Added Piercing weapons that warriors can use to the weapon section.
<P>
Right now I'm looking for data for the armor section, such as weight for small/med/large bronze and small/normal weight of crafted or any other piece of armor you would like to see added. Please send something in to help get the armor section online faster.. it doesn't have to be a picture of the stat box or anything.. just the size/type/AC/weight of the item.
<P>
If anyone would like to submit some warrior quest details or editorials/guides for anything about the warrior class such as race selection pros/cons then feel free to <A HREF="mailto:zarec@angelfire.com">send some email</A>.
<P>
<U><B>Sunday, October 17, 1999</b></U>
<P>
Weapons section updated with all the warrior wieldable slashing weapons I could find(still need pics though). Piercing/blunts/shields/ranged to follow.
<P>
<A HREF="mailto:zarec@angelfire.com">Let me know</A> if there are any inaccuracies with the weapon tables or if I missed anything. I left out the rusty/tarnished/bronze/fine steel because how many people actually use any of those after level 15-20? :)   well maybe fine steel is the exception but still.
<P>
<U><B>Saturday, October 16, 1999</b></U>
<P>
The weapons section has been put up. Not very many weapons listed YET(send in those pics!) but it's a start :)
<P>
Does anyone want the rusty/tarnished/regular/fine steel weapons added as well or should it just focus on the good stuff? <A HREF="mailto:zarec@angelfire.com">Let me know what you think.</A>
<P>
<U><B>Friday, October 15, 1999 08:58 PM</b></U>
<P>
<A HREF="bronze.html">This</A> is what I had in mind for armor sets like bronze/steel/banded.
<P>
Another way I'm trying is sorting equipment by category(ex: head/arms/chest/etc).. here is an example: 
<A HREF="headarmr.html">Head Armor</A>
<P>
 I would like some <A HREF="mailto:zarec@angelfire.com">feedback</A> on which setup is preferred and if I should include everything such as patchwork or leather? (armor warriors can wear only of course.. no robes or Etched Ivy or whatever that ranger stuff is called will be in the tables)
<P>
<U><B>Friday, October 15, 1999</b></U>
<P>
I was thinking about the equipment section layout and tables or lists in categories would probably be better than a ton of screenshots of individual pieces when it comes to armor(banded,bronze,etc). Still not sure how I'm going to add the unique items like azure sleeves or skull shaped barbute.. might be a list with screenshot links or tabled under a different catagory. It will depend on how many items are out there .
<BR>
Items that go in melee/ranged slots I would still like screenshots of.. if you can make it look like this:
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../nt/eqwarriors/images/lotw.jpg" WIDTH="315" HEIGHT="132" ALT="">
<P>
then that would be even better :)
<P>
what I did was just use microsoft paint to cut/paste in bmp format and then converted to jpg(85% quality I think) and most came out to 9-12KB in size only.. any less than 75% and picture quality starts getting bad around text so try 85% first. I only get 4-5mb with angelfire so the pics have to be small as in 15KB or less for equipment shots.
<P>
I'll start with weapons first, so please send in pictures of weapons/shields/bows/anything that fits in ranged slots that warriors can equip.
<P>
<U><B>Wednesday, October 13, 1999</b></U>
<P>
Two things keeping the equipment section from being put up is I haven't recieved any pics yet of armor or weapons, also I need to find a good program to cut/resize the bmp screenshots before I start putting things up.(send in those pics)
<P>
I'm sure alot of you know by now that crafted armor now give stat bonuses after the recent patch, some are nice while others are not too great(+2sv disease and poison?.. like that's useful) but I guess some is better than none.
