In the Innothule swamp, you talk to Lyunga, a wandering NPC troll female that can usually be found near the entrance to Guk.  After level 10 or so she will tell you that she collects gems. By the upper teens, she will tell you about her gem collection and that she wants more.  Ask her what gems and she will tell you that she wants a ruby. In return for the ruby, she gives one of several items.  Ones I know of are the Brutechopper axe, Midnight Mallet and Ivandyr's Hoop.  FYI, giving her champer's ruby from Rivervale will not work.   The criteria for what you get seems unclear and could just be random.  (Submitted by Trallak and Uggluk)

Lork wants you to find his brother Nork's dismembered body from a fat alligator in Innothule Swamp.  Kill the alligator and recover Nork's severed arm.  Take it back to Lork and he will give you a Broken Stein to take to the ogre trainer Uglan in Neriak. CAUTION - Uglan will kill shamen or shadowknights on sight.  Uglan will then ask you to intercept a Blue Orc Runner and get a letter off of him and return it to Lork.  The letter details a conspiracy between the Crushbone Orcs and the dark elves against the ogres.  For a reward, Lork will give you an item, sometimes a Crude Stein.  Then, as pay back, Lork wants you to bring him the hearts of Lord Crushbone and the dark elf ambassador who visits the shaman guild in Oggok.  The dark elf ambassador  is named K'ryn and he is located in komarr's caves (the tunnels).  If you enter the tunnels through the bottom right tunnel, contune through the tunnels until you reach the shaman trainers you should go to the right and there will be six or so ogres who sell the shaman spells.  In that room there is another tunnel which will bring you to a room with about five different passages.  In one of those passages waits the dark elf ambassador.  You need to kill him and get his heart.  (he also often drops a dragoon dagger).  For killing K'ryn, you lose faction with IndigoBrotherhood, but gain with EmeraldWarriors and SteelWarriors.  The Lord Crushbone is the always camped D'Vinn.  You need to kill him as well and get his heart.  Once you have both hearts, return them to Lork and be prepared to receive your big reward from the grateful ogre - Some rawhide armor!  Well at least you should get some dragoon daggers while doing the quest.  Basically, the only reason to do this quest is if you happen to stumble across these two dragoons and kill them and want to get rid of their hearts.  (Submitted by Oglug,Vaprak and Ghork)

This quest is also given by Hulkulk's assistant in the Shadowknight Guild.  You have to get the head of the Spore Guardian.  The Spore Guardian spawns in the Innothule swamp, and it's corpse sometimes has a "Huge Mushroom Head".  Giving the mushroom head to the the correct troll in the SK guild hall will get you a Froglok Skin Mask.  (Submitted by Sluglug and Wauke)
