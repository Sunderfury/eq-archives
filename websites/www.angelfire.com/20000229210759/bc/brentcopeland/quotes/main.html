Great post for monks up.. and fletchers.. Take a look under Abashi's posts.<P>
I'm going to start posting the topic of the actual conversation from now on, and not worry about the actual topic of the thread... This will make it easier for you to find stuff that you care about reading about, and make it much easier to navigate the site.<P>
Everyone have a good weekend..

Put up a few more quotes.. Sheesh.. it's hard to find a few of these.. LOL.. Thinking about arranging them by the "REAL" topic, than by the posters topic.. But i figured it would be easier to find for you guys that way.. Maybe i'll do both...

This is going to be an interesting one.. .It is about the featherweight pouch that went from 8 slots to 6/4(i forget) and was reduced to small objects only... <P>
Abashi seems to think we are wrong about this, but he'll find out what happened soon

Ok, so you probably see the new button over there, "Gems".. Well.. while scanning the message board for some post from the Head Honchos.. I found something that struck me funny, so I pulled it and it has started a new category for the page.. I'll probably only update it when I find something new and funny off the boards... but i will try to limit it to only 1 post a day..

Don't usually do news more than once a day, unless I see something of particular interest... 2 things right now.. for MONKS, and for Paladins:<BR>
The ac question answered per Abashi:<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/bc/brentcopeland/quotes/abashi/dec2199.html" target="_self">HERE</A><P>
And for the monk.. there are a few interesting points from Abashi under a thread that was about questions in general.. <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/bc/brentcopeland/quotes/abashi/jan03006.html" target="_self">HERE</A><P>
If i see something else today, I'll put something here for you.

Well, Abashi has said a few things on the boards so far, and has asked a question on Feign Death and Necros... Looks like they are about to nerf it again.. but this time, most people seem to agree that it is necessary...

Still trying to get everything finished. And still trying to decide whether to look up old messages, or just start from the new messages(which i'm thinking more about). If you have any suggestions, drop me a line.
