<A NAME=erollisi> Bracers of Erollisi:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>


Styria Fearnon will tell you that the pirate captain has stolen the Bracers of Erollisi.  Return them for a faction, experience some gold and a minor item.  The factions which change are as follows:  Faydark's Champions, King Tearisthex, Clerics of Tunare and Soldiers of Tunare get better and Crushbone Orcs gets worse.  Basically the bracers are worth more than the reward.  (Submitted by Doriath)

<A NAME=hehe>HEHE meat:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
This is the quest to get the Grobb Cleaver.  It starts in Grobb (of course).  Talk to Carver, by the Shaman's guild, and he will tell you he wants 3 pieces of a meat called "HEHE meat" and the recipe to make it.  You can purchase the meat in Oggok from Dooga the Ogre Chef.  (He has a seperate quest to deliver froglock legs).   He will send you to deliver a Grub Locker of Dwarf Pickles to his Troll friend in the Ocean of Tears, Nerbilik.  Nerbilik is fishing on the Siren rocks.  Be careful, since I have been told the guards may kill you even though they con indifferent.  Give him the locker and you will receive approximately 1 plat, increased faction with DaBashers and decreased faction with BrokenSkull Clan, and some xp.  However, he will refuse to give you the recipe he has, so you need to kill him and loot it from his corpse.  Then take the recipe and 3 HEHE meats back to Carver and he will give you a Grobb Cleaver for you efforts.  (Submitted by Ashrum)

<A NAME=knight>Knight Cards:    </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
After you kill  the gnomish clockwork "Cleaner VII" which wanders Northern Kaladim and return his remains to Beno Tenarle, he will give you a knight card  which he would like you to return to the smith, Doran Vargnus.  Doran Vargnus is one of the dwarven smiths shipwrecked on the Island of Erollisi.  The island is located in the Ocean of Tears between Kaladim and Freeport.  The dwarves are camped in a small tent on the southeast corner of the island. (LOC: 1280 -9245)  Complete the quest by giving the knight card to Doran.  He gives you an item for the card which ranges from cloth to some pretty nice armor pieces such as blackened and bronze, and even dwarven mail.  Also, Doran is not picky about where you get the Knight card.  You can get knight cards (among others) by playing poker with either Moodoro Finharn in the fish's ale (See the Library Book quest in Qeynos) or with Zenita DRin in Freeport (See the Telescope Lens quest in Steamfont) and he will give you items for these cards as well.

<A NAME=mudtoes> The Mudtoes:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Furtog Ogrebane in Kaladim will tell you that his father killed a whole tribe of ogres (the Mudtoes) except for two that got away.   Then he tells you to go to the docks in BB and find more info on it. You have to go to the Butcherblock port and talk to the girl on the end and she'll tell you to find the two remaining Mudtoes, Boog and Goob, in the Sea of Tears. You will find one named Boog Mudtoe (lev 17) on the island right across from the all girl island of Erollisi. You kill him and get his head and a note that is to his brother.  His brother is on the island with Gornit the Giant.  He is a shaman and casts root a lot, so you have to be careful attacking him.  Take their heads back to Furtog for a decent item and the Trumpy Irontoe quest.  (Submitted by Doomfist)

<A NAME=pirate>Pirate Earrings:   </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Styria Fearnon on Eriollisi will give a quest to return pirate earrings to her for a minor item, a few coins, and faction adjustments.  The pirates are on another island.  When you submit the earrings, you get the following faction adjustments:   faydarks champions, King teristhes, clerics of tunare, and soldiers of tunare go up and crushbone orcs go down.

<A NAME=xyrinn> Sentry Xyrinn:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Somewhere in the Ocean of Tears there is an undead island (rough loc of -604.96, -7343.81).  The island is populated by a few greater skeletons, a couple gargoyles, and four specters.  There you will find stranded a female paladin named Sentry Xyrin.  She mentions that she was part of a [boat disaster] and that she is from the temple of Marr in Freeport.  She will ask you to get her a [Potion of Marr] from Serna Tasknon is the Temple of Marr in Freeport.  With the potion she will be able to regain her strength and take on the undead.  (You can also initiate this quest by first speaking to someone in the Temple of Marr, getting the potion, and from that point on learning of Sentry Xyrinn's location and going to look for her).   You have to get the bottle from the Temple of Marr and then bring the bottle to all the 8 guards in alphabetical order (It does not tell you all the names so you must figure this out yourself).  It seems that if your faction is not high enough you can't get the bottle.  When you give it to the last person (not including Xyrinn) he will tell you that she went to the Sisterhood of Erolisi.  The sisters will tell you she is either dead or stranded on a nearby island.  Then go to the island where she is stranded and give the bottle to her.  She will give it back to you to take back to the temple, after which you will be done.  (Submitted by the Monk Kausee and by IceAssasin)

<A NAME=ages>Tome of Ages:  </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
This looks like another long and involved quest, which may not yet be active.  It starts on the Island of the Isle Goblins across from the Isle of the Sisterhood of Erollisi.  Talk to the Oracle of K'Arnon.  He asks if you seek knowledge or offer something.  Either way, you get to what he seeks: The Tome of Ages written by the Scribes of Dal.  This is a group of dark elves who broke the tomb into seven separate pieces, perhaps to keep it from the oracle.  Asking about the Scribes, he says that if he knew where they were, he would not be asking you to find them.  It seems that you need to find the pieces and combine them to re-form the Tome of Ages.  I only know of one book which you can definitely obtain:  The Book of Turmoil in Neriak, which, when given back to the Oracle of K'Arnon, yields a Glowing Torch (a nice item for enchanters), a bit of exp and the following factions adjustments:  Oracle of K'Arnon goes up, Oracle of Marud goes down.  (I wonder where that Oracle is?).  The other six books are most likely Book of Enlightenment, The Lost Book, Book of Blood, Book of Monuments, Book of Elders and Book of Scale.  However, the message given for using the Keywords of the other 6 books are all basically the same. "I do not seek the <bookname> at this time, but I may have need of it in the future".  Thus, it is likely that you either have to be a very high level to complete the quest or it is not yet complete. (Submitted by Lady Motoko and Aaldin D'Brain)
