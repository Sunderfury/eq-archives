<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FFFF00">As soon as I start a new cleric, I do a few
  things.&nbsp; First I run the the Necro guild, all the way to the top.&nbsp;
  Hail the guy, and say, &quot;I collect beetle eyes&quot;.&nbsp; You get a 10
  slot small item box.&nbsp; This box is for collecting beetle eyes, but I use
  it for a backpack (Most of the stuff you get at that level will fit - besides
  pelts, which I have another use for).&nbsp; Then I go to the Cleric guild and
  turn in my note.&nbsp; Equip my new items (Shirt and 1-hand blunt item).&nbsp;
  Then I train 4 into 1hand blunt, and 1 into Tailoring.&nbsp; Now I am ready to
  venture outside.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#00FFFF">Now I run outside.&nbsp; Most people go to the
  &quot;Newbie Log&quot;.&nbsp; Well, I think it is usually to crowded
  here.&nbsp; I might fight there up to 2nd level, but after that I go to a
  different place.&nbsp; When you get to the newbie log, you will see a canyon off to one side.&nbsp; Go towards the canyon's center, and you should keep
  running up the canyon, and see a path.&nbsp; Cross the path.&nbsp; There
  should be a Hill in front of you.&nbsp; Go over the hill, and Here is where I
  like to fight (I'll put a map up here soon, to make it easier to understand
  where I am talking about.)</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF00FF">Kill anything in this area, except beetles, and spiders
  (They will help each other).&nbsp; Save the pelts if you have spaces.&nbsp;
  And try to loot stackables that will fit in your container.&nbsp; When you
  fill up, run back and sell what you have, and if you have leveled, go to the
  3rd gate.&nbsp; Train all you can in Tailoring.&nbsp; See if you have enough
  for a sewing kit (if so, the kit will double as a 2 space backpack as
  well).&nbsp; If I still have enough money for patterns, I will buy a tunic or
  leggings, and try to make it with the pelts I have gathered.&nbsp; Then I go
  back outside to fight.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#00FF00">If I am 3rd level, I will start trying to take on
  a few beetles or spiders that I have singled out, away from the rest.&nbsp; At
  this point, just take what you can, and as many.&nbsp; Experience will
  come.&nbsp; Keep selling when you need to, and buy as many patterns when you
  go to train, and you should have around a 20 tailoring skill, and almost a
  full suit of patchwork by level 5.&nbsp; At this point, it is a good idea to
  try and save money for your spells the next level.</font></p>
