<B>Welcome to The Warrior's Arena, a page made for the warriors of Norrath(Everquest.. the online game)</B>
<P>

<h3>Please use <A HREF="http://eqwarriors.cjb.net/" target="_blank"><FONT COLOR=#ffff80><b>eqwarriors.cjb.net</B></FONT></a> to access the site, that address should bring you to wherever the site currently is</h3>
<P>
I'm testing a new site because of speed and connectivity issues with angelfire.
<P>
lemme know if you like it :)

I've been having problems accessing this web site, might be my ISP.. or not. If anyone else finds it to be really slow or not loading pages properly, please post on the message board.
<P>
I may move it to another site if it's not just me having problems.
<P>
Not many updates lately because I've been playing too much EQ ;)   damn those post 50 levels take long unless you got certain groups or manage to solo(as a warrior.. yeah right).
<P>
The email address is rather flaky also.. half the time I can't access it. I think I'm going to change that soon as well(current one not well suited for getting screenshots anyways, btw send in those shots already!).

This was found on the Everquest message boards:

"As promised, I brought the issue up at the tuning meeting. 
After some discussion, we agreed that risk vs. reward as it relates to quite a few Kunark high level items is not as intended. 
The solution will be to move items around, making sure the encounter and difficulty reaching the encounter is more in line with the quality/power of the item(s) obtained. 
The solution will NOT be a retroactive upgrade of existing items due to our desire to avoid MUDflation whenever possible.

I hope it doesn't mean they'll move the "no drop" items from Veeshan's Peak to Sebilis and vice versa.
<P>
There's no point going to Veeshan's Peak if you and your guild already got most of the items available there from Sebilis a few months earlier.
<P>
What is this MUDflation? I've never heard this term before..(post explanation on <A HREF="http://pub22.ezboard.com/beqwarriors">message board</A> anyone?)
<P>
The risk vs reward seems fine in Sebilis, I hear the only problem is the overcrowding(on blue servers) which makes the dungeon fairly easy. Perhaps they should make The Hole and Chardok worth going to.(items with same stats but different looks maybe, or just the same items). VP loot is currently equal or worse than other Kunark loot, they're no drop.. what would be wrong with upgrading the items slightly or pull the mask of deception/guise of the deceiver trick again.. new items but slightly different and/or better than before.
<P>
There should be some items no one has got from VP yet, which should be upgraded if they suck as much as the ones currently found considering the risk involved.(although some of the items are nice.. they're just BARELY better than what can be camped by 6 people in Sebilis).

/slight rant off :)
