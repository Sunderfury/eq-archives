<BR>  Hello folks, It's Nanny again.  I'm just here to tell that the officers in the guild need to report to the message board ASAP and go to the officer section.  This mean ALL officers.  We're tightening the reins on the officers folks.  It'll now require some work to be an officer.  So get ready for some more things from us in the coming months.

<P><U><B>Nov 26th, 2001</U></B>
<BR>Well folks, been ages since I've been in this HTML text to update this part of the site.  That's right it's Nanny (Nanarc).  I'm here to let everyone know that we have recently succeded in getting both Dennli and Kethlis their leadership withen the guild.  So Stormwarden is now a tri-umverate.  I personally need to pick up on my share of the work.  So if you see me in game and have some questions then just ask me, give Dennli and Kethlis a bit of a break.  Thanks folks, hope to talk to you soon.



<P><U><B>Aug 24th, 2001</U></B>
<BR>Added about 30 pictures to the site, and did some clean up on the members page. If your not on this list, or see that someone has left the guild - please notifiy me so i can make the neccessary changes. Also pls continue to send in screenshots of your character, stories, information, etc...


<P><U><B>July 19th, 2001</U></B>
<BR>Well i cleaned up the format for the no-frame site. Now you should notice some consistancy within each page. I added in the comedy, and email links, into the main menu selection. I hope these changes make browsing a little easier for those who mainly use the no-frame site. Im keeping the partchment paper look on the no-frame site for now, but if you are tired of that and would like a newer color scheme - similar to what i did with the Frame site - pls let me know in game, email, or on the message board.

<P> <U><B>July 6th, 2001</U></B>
<BR>[NOTE: FOR FRAME USERS MAINLY] You may have noticed a new look to the website. Yup, version 2.3 is now intact, this is the second overall ive made to the site, i hope you like it. Any complaints just email me or post it on the msg board and i will take all suggestions into consideration. I realize that some of the color may be slightly off and i am always willing to tweek it for your comfort. Keep tuned to the site as there are several developing ideas in the works, such as:<BR>
<LI> Member Bio's
<LI> Member pics linked to the members list page
<LI> Revamping of pictures page.

<P>We are also now accepting character art or EQ art that you would like to submit. All submitions can be emailed to Dennli Truehart. If you own a pen and feel like scribbling down a pic, well go out and scan it and send it in. All submitions will be given fair and honorable representation.


<P><U><B>June 18th, 2001</U></B>
<BR>-After 2 hours of editing, i have addeded another 20 pics to the site. Also you will notice that I have added a section heading to the pictures site labelled "Guild Events and Raids". Now we can keep photos of those raids we so often go on. If anyone has pics from Ralerwens Befallen Raid, send em in, i think they'd make a great addition. For now, keep sending in your character pics and other sceen shots.
<BR>-Also updated the members list a tad. Not much to update, but pls note that there are many officer openings still available. Cleric x2, Bard x2, Wizard x2, Rogue x2 ....are just a few. If your interested in becomming an officer here are some quick quildlines. (1)attend events and raids (2)help others if they ask - within reason (3)Must have lvl 20 min (4)Gain votes of your guildmates, your submission of Officer Must be supported by two other guildmates.
<BR>-hopefully ill get to do some web revisions to the overall look within the next few months, time permitting. If anyone has suggestions, send me an email, post your idea on the msg board or send me a tell.


<P><U><B>June 11th, 2001</U></B>
<BR>-During the week we have had a dozen new members join the guild, those names are now added to the members roster. Check it out and send a Wusssap! to your new mates, make em welcome and at home.
<BR>-wrap up notes from the Unrest raid are posted in Daily Life, including winners of event prizes.
<BR>-new pics will be updated later on this week, i appolagize for the long delay in adding your submittions they will be up soon though.
<BR>-if you are still using the old message board, pls stop, the new msg board is up and live. Links to the board can be found though out the web page.

Okay everyone.  I have the <a href="comedy.html">Comedy section</a> up and running.   I'm going to try and add a new joke everyday.  But if I miss a day sorry guys.  Anyway, I'd like to see what people are thinking of the web-site so if you want you can post your thoughts on the message board or send them to Stormsitecomments@dragonsworn.com

<P><B><U>Feburary 26, 2001</U></B> <BR>
The guild leader has requested to have everyone's e-mail address mailed to him as such he can keep everyone updated on current events and other fun things.  So if everyone could e-mail Derkarc/Nanarc at Derkarc@dragonsworn.com he would appreciate it a lot.

<P><B><U>Feburary 21, 2001</U></B> <BR>
The Guild has come into possession of several Veliours and Frost weapons (swords-spear-staffs) and we thought to our selves "What the heck are we gonna do with two bags of weapons?" The answer.....GUILD EVENT.
<P>Yes - for all those of you who have been asking "Are we gonna do anything?" Im pleased to satisfy your cravings for events. Now all you have to do is participate. If you dont partipate, I dont wanna hear anyone complaining or whining, we've had a raid in the past that was well advertised a month in advance and we only had about 7 people show up. So now is your time to GET INVOLVED. Read the details about the event <a href="events.html">here</a>.
<P>No date has been set as of yet - id like your input as to when we should have it. Send in your time/date requests via email or msg bord. Do not send me tells in the game - I'm getting swampped with many many tells as is now. So please use email and the msg bord - thats what its for. 

<P><B><U>Feburary 14, 2001</U></B> <BR>
Well Happy Valentine's day everyone.  Hope I only see you bachleors on tonight.  Your supposed to spend it with your sweeties.  Hehe.  Okay, if any problems inside the guild occur, please e-mail them to Derkarc as his EverQuest is acting up and he is haveing problems logging on.  That's all for now.

<P><B><U>Feburary 5, 2001</U></B> <BR>

<P><B></B><U>January 11, 2001</U><BR>

The Webapge is undergoing many changes.  The member list has been updated again.  It now has two new categories.  
I.Members In Good Standing
II.Members Of The Council
The members in good standing section shows those people that are being considered for a increase in rank.  Also that guild members can count on these people to at least try to help if you are having a problem.

<P><B><U>January 8, 2001</U></B> <BR>
The Message Board was updated.  It now tells how to become an Officer and/or a Council member.  Please follow the instructions there if you want to be an Officer and/or a Council member.

<P><B><U>January 6, 2001</U></B> <BR>
Last night we offically became a guild thanks to Derkarc and the GM  Novicin - and of course all of you. Thanks everyone for being patient I think the formation went fairly smoothly. Many of us got together in CB afterwards for some orc bashing to celebrate, kind of our first unoffical event. Although it did not go well for some of us (i died twice myself- LOL), think of it like this: were new and it takes a bit of getting used to working as a large team. If anyone took some screen shots please send them in as i would love to post them. For now please look over the site and feel free to let me know what you want to see on the webpage, and within the guild. Your input is important to the success and growth of the guild.


<P><B><U>January 3, 2001</U></B><BR>
Our own Message Bord is up and running. check it out - and post your ideas and questions. This is a great way to stay in touch and uptodate with your guildmates and events.

<P><B><U>January 1, 2001</U></B><BR>

I would like to thank you Derkarc for forming the guild that fateful night in Gfay at the PoD. I would also like to thank everyone who joined up with us. We now await the GM's official approval of our Guild and our charter.</P>

<P>The site is slowly being created, not many links work but the email link on the left menu works so send in your character names with a Picture(optional) so we can create a members list.</P></B></font>
