<A NAME=aenia>Aenia and Behroe:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
In North Queynos there's a blue house which holds a daughter and her father.  Only thing is they never leave. Why?  Well first because the father hasn't gotten his shop up yet and more importantly because his daughter, Aenia, is not allowed to leave the house.  This is because he doesn't want her around such rapscallions as those lowly bards, especially one certain one named Behroe Dlexon, who works nights at the docks compiling the watch report.  Well it turns out that Aenia and Behroe are in love and if you go see him he tells his tale of woe.  He is upset because Aenia's father will kill him if he goes near her.  The lovesick fool has written a ballad that he will ask you to sing to her for him.  You need to /say to Aenia the entire sonnet.  Make sure you don't make a typo or it won't work.  Aenia will swoon and gave you a love letter to take back to Behroe (note that Behroe only spawns at night - you might have to start the "watch reports" quest to spawn him).  Take the love letter back to Behroe and he gives you a nice low-level item.  (Usually a Shaw of the Wind Spirit).  For completing the quest you get the following faction:  LeagueofAntonicanBards, KnightsofTruth and GuardsofQeynos get better; RingofScale and MayongMistmoore get worse.

<A NAME=ass>The Assassin:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
This quest is sometimes given to you after you complete the Nitrates quest in Surefall Glades.  Return to surefall and give the note to Gerael for status and few coins.  Gerael  returns the note to you and asks you to give it to Captain Tillim in Qeynos. He asks you to also to warn the target (Gash Flockwaller) that [They are Trying to kill him].   Go to Qeynos and give the note to Captain Tillim.  You are rewarded with some faction and told that Gash stays in the Lion's head INN. Going to the Lion's head inn.  Gash Flockwaller should be in a back room during the day. Talking to him and repeating the key phrase as [they are trying to kill you] gives you a clue about the unkempt druids - that they carry [black wood chips].  Somewhere in this the Assassin will attack - his name is Raffel Minnmorn.   At this point the quest may be broken.  One time I beat the assassin with Gash's assistance - as a result the body dissappeared and I couldn't loot it; the second time I got a ranger/druid mob together and we splatted him, but since I hadn't gotten the wood chip comment yet all that I got from him was a rusty dagger.  Raffel con's black to a 10th level ranger, but he has a slew of druid spells and shouldn't be solo'd unless  you are pretty strong or lucky.  So the ending is still unclear.

<A NAME=bard>Bard Reports:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
Bard Reports: The Bard Guild's needs your help in keeping an eye on the town, if you wish to accept their assignment.  Talk to Juseanus and he will give you two scrolls to deliver.  Take one to the North gate and another to the docks.  You may be given scrolls to return as well.  Each delivery is worth a little bit of experience.  Also, the following factions will improve:  LeagueofAntonicanBards, KnightsofTruth, GuardsofQeynos.  RingofScale and MayongMistmoore go down.  Because you can do this quickly and get a faction hit for each delivery, this is a good way to improve faction.

There's a shop called "The Herb Jar."  If you sit there for a while,the person in the middle of the room behind the podium says to one of her co-workers, "We're out of bat fur again?"  Ask her about bat fur.  I am told that you get little if no reward for this quest other than some faction changes.

<A NAME=bayle>The Bayle List:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
A paladin in the Temple of Thunder is investigating corruption among the guards of Qeynos. He asks you to go to Surefall Glade, find Frenway Marthank in the Druids' Guildtree, and ask him for "The Bayle List."  However, when you do, Frenway is in a state of depression.  His son -- who happened to be carrying the very list you're looking for -- was killed and devoured by the great grizzly bear Mammoth, who lives deep in the caves of Surefall Glade.  As a Druid, Frenway is forbidden to harm the bears of the Glade, but he wants vengeance.  If you can find and slay Mammoth, you will get the list, and Frenway will reward you if you return with Mammoth's hide.  However, there are more than a few people in Surefall Glade who will strike you down for attacking the bears, so be very careful. (Submitted by Shendar)

Hail Gnasher, give him the note, and he will give you a shipment of blackburrow Stout. Take it back to the barkeep, and you get some experience and a free bottle of Stout.

The Wizard's Guild needs blank scroll sheets. Talk to Kazlo and he will ask you to go to Surefall Glade to see if the druids have any blank scroll sheets.  There may be other ways to get them, but Den Magason (wanders around the dock area) will sell you blank scroll sheets for 2 gold a sheet.  You will not get your money back when you turn them in, but you will get some xp, faction and some minor coin.  (Submitted by Doriath and Lysan)

<A NAME=oil>Blessed Oil Quest:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
This starts in Western Karana by talking to Brother Estle, located on the road just as you enter the plains.  Talk to him and he will tell you that he is waiting to get some blessed oil, perhaps to slick down the other monk he is always fighting.  Go to the Temple of Life and talk to one of the priests, who will give you the oil to deliver to the good monk.  Take it back to him for some money, experience, faction with the Priests of Life and occasionally the Prayer bead quest.

Tabure Ahendle, by the arena in Qeynos, is concerned about a map her apprentice had on him when he was shipwrecked while crossing over from Erudin.  It is possible that you will have to perform another quest before she tells you this information.  On the island in Erud's crossing, you can kill zombie sailors who will occasionally drop a blurred map.  Give this to her for some coin, xp and a minor item.

There's an NPC named Lashun Novashine.  He's found either on the runway leading up to the flying saucer, or out wandering around in the newby area.  You'll see him shouting out "Cease this endless conflict ... "  If you give him two skeleton bones, he will give you exp and faction and sometimes cast a healing spell on you.

Two of the guards apparently missed breakfast.  One named Wenbie speaks to you of [Voleen's Bakery] and the other, Guard Lasen, complains that even when it rains, he gets thirsty.  Give a Muffin to Wenbie, and a Flask of Water to Lasen, and you get some small coin, faction, and some XP from each of them.  It is possible that you may get a brass ring (+1 char waist item) if you give Wenbie enough muffins.

<A NAME=bridge>The Bridge:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
In Queynos there is a guy named Hansl Bigroon.  If you talk to him he will talk about making a bridge to Odus.  He needs a list of engineers delivered to Antonius Bayles' messenger.   If you follow him to his house, he usually drops the note.  (His house is the left door of the 2 door house across from the house of the man who gives the tax collectors quest.).  The engineers are one human, one dwarf and one gnome.  The human engineer is located in the arcane science building in Freeport, but I don't know what you need to do to get him to respond (giving him the note doesn't work).   The gnome he said was followed around by some sort of automation (perhaps the one in Steamfont?).  I also don't know who Antonius Bayle's messenger is, who is supposed to get the note.  I have been told of unsuccessful attempts to give the note to Captain Tillian and Gharin.    I am not sure where to go from there, but it sounds intriguing.

One of the bards in the bards guild in Qeynos gives a quest.  He gives you his broken lute named the lisero to take to another npc bard "somewhere in Karana" named  Vhalen Nostrolo.  Vhalen is located in South Karanas near a small pyramid, and when you give him the lute, he gives you a note which you return to the guild for a meager reward. (Submitted by Mikelangelo)

Tell Suuspa Clanim in the Temple of Life in North Qeynos about Brother Trintle attacking Brother Estle and she is shocked and expresses the thought that Trintle must have been swayed by the words of Bertoxxulous. If you kill Brother Trintle in West Karanas you discover that indeed he is now a follower of Bertoxxulous. He has on him Broken Prayer beads, which when given to Suuspa will result in some decent faction hits.  (Submitted by Sanas)

<A NAME=camlend>Camlend's Scythe Quest:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>
The quest is given by Camlend Serbold at Qeynos' Temple of Life. You are supposed to bring him the Opal Scythe (found on Lord Grimrot in SK). The catch is that Lord Grimrot spawns in two versions- a weak one (level 25 or so) without the scythe, and a BIG level 35 with the scythe. Both have harm touch and all the other appropriate SK abilities.  The big version can solo a cyclops quite easily, and has no problems making mincemeat out of anything less than a full 35'ish group.  The reward for turning in the scythe to Camlend is actually far less than the value of the scythe, so it isn't really worth doing.  Note:  some people have claimed this is how you get the oaken scimitar, but many others have disputed that claim, so I wouldn't recommend trying this.

<A NAME=sisters>Clothspinner Sisters:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>You will occasionally see an NPC running around outside the gates whose last name is Clothspinner.  Knowledge of this quest is still developing, but here are the basics.  Talk to her and hear her tale of woe.  She will tell you that she misses her warrior sister, and will give you a letter to deliver to her sister somewhere in the Karanas.  The sister is located in East Karana in a cave.  Deliver the note to her, and she will thank you and give you a monogrammed cloth to take back to her sister.  She will then be rewarded for talking to you by being attacked by a guard and killed.  Bet that makes you feel good.  If you kill the guard and the sister lives, she also gives you a veil to give to the sister.  When you give the original sister the cloth she will send you with a note to the Temple of Life.  If you give her the veil, you get a decent item as well.  There you may or may not be rewarded, depending it seems upon your alignment and religion.

<A NAME=lempeck>Cure for Lempeck Hargrim:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>This is the quest for the Shining Star of Light, a 1HB cleric/paladin weapon.  The quest starts with Astaed Wemore, the same cleric in the Temple of Life who gives the blessed oil quest.  Apparantly Lempic Hargrim is sick and needs a special cure.  He will tell you to go to Rivervale and find Kizzie Mintopp, and tell her that "I am from temple of life".   She will then tell you to find some guy called Honeybugger outside in Misty Thicket and find out how to get honeycombs, because she needs them to make Honey Jum.  Bring her the honeycombs and she makes the Honey Jum for you.   You then need to give it back to the cleric who gave you the quest.  He will make the Jum into a potion for Lempeck Hargrim of West Karana.  Take the Potion to Lempeck, and receive a rusty scyth (Lore item version).  I have been told that if your faction is not high enough with the Prieses of Life (probably at least amiable) he will attack and kill you, so be careful.  Take the scyth back to the Aeston Wemore, and you get the shining star.  Quickest method to complete the quest without all the talking:  1).  Give Kizzie Mintopp 3 honeycombs and 5 gp for the Honey Jum. 2).  Take Honey Jum to Cleric in temple of life (the one who gives the quest) and get Potion in return.  3).  Take Potion to Lempeck Hargrim of West Karana and get LORE ITEM RUSTY SCYTH - NO DROP  in return.  His house is near the river bank, between the fields.  4).  Take Rusty Scyth back to cleric in temple of life for the shining star of light.  You also receive the following faction changes:  Priests of Life, Knights of Thunder, Guards of Qeynos and Antonius Bayle get better, Blood Sabres gets worse.

<A NAME=diseased>Diseased Animals:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>Priestess Caulria in the temple in North Qeynos (the one in leather near the back wall) gives the quest, which requires you to look into the occurrence of rabid wolves in the area.  Rabid wolves and bears are found in the Qeynos Hills. Return a 'diseased wolf pelt' to her for faction bonuses, experience and a 'cure disease' spell that she casts on you to purge you of that annoying PlagueRatDisease and Rabies. There are also rabid grizzly bears in the Hills, and if you return one of the pelts to her, you get a spell scroll in addition to the faction bonuses.  You do not get a cure for this quest, so make sure you keep a diseased wolf pelt to give to her after the bear pelts, as rabies is annoying and takes an age to wear off. Sometimes, fairly rarely, you get a 'fleshy orb' on one of the rabid creatures. Give this to her, you'll get faction bonuses, some cash, and she'll give you back a lore version and ask you to take it to someone in Freeport (Lorme Trethadore or something like that)(Note there is a Lorne Tredore in the academy, but this doesn't seem to be the right person).

The two gents who make bags in North Qeynos.  A bard in the Bard's guild (says he donates to his own cause) in South Qeynos.

Enic must find Frostbite and retrieve the corpse of the fish.  Frostbite can be found at the Barbarian fishing village in the Westren Karanas.   Watch out! Ulrich McMannus is very fond of the mutt and will insta-kill you if he sees you harming Frostbite.  Also, frostbite does not always have a fish on him when you kill him and killing him causes severe faction drops with several barbarian factions.  Deliver the fish corpse and you will get some decent gold and sometimes a nice item as well (Possibly prayer beads).  A note on this.  You can also complete this quest by killing Koalindl fish yourself, taking the severe faction hit, getting killed by the guard, and turning in the fish corpse to Ruklin.  If you're not worried about the faction loss you will take and don't care about dying (i.e. are below level 4), this is a good way to make some money.  (Submitted by Esmeraude)

Too lazy to do it himself I guess, he wants you to kill his enemy for him.  This gnoll occasionally appears in Qeynos Hills and is around level 10 or so.  Kill him and bring his head back to Lars and you will get some cash.  Sometimes when you kill Gnasher Furrgutt, he is carrying a note from the bartender at Fish's Ale which you can turn in to the authorities. First, give the note to Larsk Juton (the same person you give Gnasher's head to).  Note that you canot shortcut this by giving the note to Captain Tillian directly. He will give you some experience and a faction adjustment, and advise you to take the note to Captain Tillian in the Arena in Qeynos (the same one you give Gnoll Fangs to). Captain Tillian will give you more experience, more faction adjustments, and a Medal of Merit (a Lore Item which gives you +5 Charisma) for your good deeds. He will then summon the Executioner, who will proceed to Fish's Ale to carry out the sentence of death pronounced on the unwise bartender.   Follow the executioner and watch the fun.  Another note.  If you are carrying gnoll fangs for Captain Tillian, give them to him and go collect the blackburrow stout  first, since the executioner will kill your stout connection and he won't respawn for a while.

<A NAME=fangs>Gnoll Fangs:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>The factions have now changed on this.  You may have noticed that on occasion you get a gnoll fang after killing a gnoll.  You have probably been throwing them away since merchants disdain buying those dirty gnoll teeth.  But wait!  There is a guard Captain (Captain Tillin) located on the top floor of the arena in Qeynos who seems to have a pathological hatred of gnolls (don't we all).  Take him your collection of fangs and give them to him one at a time for some experience and a moonstone.  Then take your collection of moonstones to Fish's Ale (a pub down by the docks) and go into the back room, you'll find a bartender named Mcneal Jocub.  Give the moonstones to the bartender, and for each stone, you'll recieve a bottle of Blackburrow Stout, experience and more faction adjustments.  The value of a bottle of stout is in the range of 7 sp.  Giving a gnoll tooth to Captain Tillin raises your faction with GuardsofQeynos.  Giving a moonstone to Mcneal Jocub raises your faction with Karana Residents, Guards of Qeynos, Priests of Life, Knights of Thunder.  Thus each gnoll fang is worth some experience, good faction, and just short of a gold.  Well worth the trip to town.  (Submitted by Edmond the Tall of Rivervale)

<A NAME=package>The Package:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>This quest is initiated by talking to Ghil Starn in the Qeynos Thieves' Guild.  Ghil needs you to deliver a package to Den Magason, who is usually at the docks or in Mermaid's Lure.  After giving you the package, he asks that you help Den in anyway possible.  Successfully delivering the package raises faction with Merchants of Qeynos, Antonius Bayle, Coalition of TradeFolk, and Guards of Qeynos.  It lowers Circle of Unseen Hands (strange).  Den gives you the task of collecting some items for him.  He is in need of Snake Scales, High Quality Bear Skin, High Quality Wolf Skin, and some Bat Fur.  When these items are returned, the same factions get hit, and a little gold is received.  He then gives you a note to return to Ghil.  Returning the note improves faction with Circle of Unseen Hands, Corrupt Qeynos Guards, and Kane Bayle.  It lowers Merchants of Qeynos and Guards of Qeynos.  You get some more cash, and a nice set of gloves (AC1, +3 dex).  (Submitted by Turlo Lomon)

<A NAME=painting>The Painting:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>(This quest may be broken)   In Qeynos there is an Erudite Enchanter that roams the docks. Her name is Danaria Hollin and she wants someone to go to Freeport to pick up a painting from Palatos Kynarn.  He is in E. Freeport in a very seedy part of town.  You hail him and tell that Danaria sent you for the painting.  He says you are waisting your time and all he wants is Captain.  Captain is a drink that you buy from the vendor there.  (Captain Jack?)  After giving him 4 he tells you he needs a boat beacon mount.  He tells you to go see the gnomes about getting it.  The Gnomes he refers to are the two brothers Svinal and Lystyn Wyspin who run 'The Emporium' store next to the bank in North Freeport.  The gnomes will tell you basically you will need good skill in Smithing (About 70+) and several items.  Take the Boat Beacon Mount, a Greater Lightstone, a Metal Disk, and a Copper Band and combine them in a forge.  The Metal Disk and Copper Band are sold by the Gnomes.  When combined you get a Boat Beacon (Lore Item) which can go in the 2nd Melee slot to activate it.  It is a Lantern that casts light like a Greater Lightstone.  If you take the beacon back to Palatos, you gain a small amount of exp, faction and some change.   However, he mentions that Lenka Stouthart, who is by the docks in Freeport, has some interest in it.   If you take the beacon to her, she will give you the painting (no drop lore item).   However, returning the painting to Danaria just gets you a thank you, so you obviously need to take it somewhere else (perhaps back to Erudin to the enchanter's guild).  I have no information beyond this point as to whether this leads to anything good.    (Submitted by Lady Chantress)

<A NAME=paw>Paw of Opalla:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>This is the quest for the Paw of Opolla.  In the Fish Ale pub in South Qeynos there is a man named Micc Koter standing at the bar.  His companion (whose name I forget) will occasionally mumble about someone "foolish going after the Paw of Opolla".  When you ask the companion about it, he tells you to mind your own business, but Micc will tell him to behave.  Ask Micc about the Paw of Opolla and he will tell you it is a magical item and it belongs to "some gnoll bitch".  He will offer to tell you where to find it if you buy him a brandy.  I had to buy 2 to get him to talk.  He then says that someone calling himself Caninel went to find it in the Plains of Karana.  Caniel is located in West Karana, along with two named gnolls, along the mountains near the border with North Karana.  When you talk to Caninel, he will demand 3 gems before telling you about the Paw of Opolla (Moonstone, Bloodstone, and a Star Rose Quartz). He will then tell you about how when the humans from Everfrost first met the Blackburrow Gnolls, the Shaman Opolla greeted them warmly and had her hand cut off by Gynok Molter. She placed a curse upon the Molter descendants, the last of which can be found in under Qeynos.  He tells you to ask him about the paw and also about the rings on the paw. When you find him (Vin Molter), he will demand 3 bottles of Khalish and a rat meat pie for the paw. He will deny any knowledge of the rings and say that his father probably sold them, mentioning his father's travels in Odus.  You can get the pie in Qeynos Hills, or you can kill him to get the paw container. This is not the actual item, since it seems it is the rings that activate its magic.  There are four rings that need to be put in the paw container and combined to get the true paw:  platinum, gold, silver and copper.  Look for rings with a +1 xx, -1 char stat.  The platinum ring is definitely on a mummy in befallen named Gynok Moltar.  I have been told that as many as all three of the other rings can be looted from the Kerran priest Mitty on Kerra Island.  I have also been told that the silver ring has been found in the lake in Blackburrow(this has been confirmed).   Others have said they purchased some of the rings from merchants.  To make sure you have the right ring, cast identify on it and see if it is a ring of Opallo. (Submitted by Esmeraude and Herky)

Giving him this will Raise some factions while lowering yer merchants standings and it will open The Tattered Pouch quest. After offering him the 2gp (you can use any combination of money i.e. Gold, Silver and Coppers to make the 2gp) he will tell you about a mysterious pouch he happened to pick up off the street and for an additional 3gp's, he is starving after all, he will give you the pouch. At this point, once again, the same factions raise and lower, and he tells you that Crow is known for being a fencer, and quickly changes that to Crow being familiar with the local goings on and says he knows a good deal about "missing" items. After leaving the filthy bum, high tail it to Crow's bar. Hand him the Tattered pouch and this quest is done.

He will give you a box, in which to place and combine the taxes, and a scroll with the names of the people.  To get the taxes from the, simply hail them and say "Please pay your taxes."  Doing this will give you a very small lowering of faction with Qeynos merchants.  Upon going to Mira Sayer, In Qeynos Hills, and asking her to pay, she will begin to cry.  When you ask her why she is crying, she will tell you a halfling named Flynn something or other stole her tax money.  He is in Crow's Pub in Qeynos.  Go to him, hail him, and ask him if he stole Mira's tax money.  He will affirm this, and tell you to say "I am a gnoll loving weakling and am not worthy to comb your feet" <grin>  After doing so, he will shout it, and the entire zone will hear what an idiot you are.  He'll give you the money, combine it, and give it to the tax man.  You'll get a couple silver, and an item (sometimes a silver stud and/or a Brass Ring).  A tip for those of you who need an extra way to hold items.  If you keep the tax collection box, you will have a 10 slot box to hold items, and you can get this as low as level 1.  Not bad.

This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest.   The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last checked it out.  When you ask him, he tells you that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.  He tells you to go talk to his sister who is in the Erudin Palace.  Once there, she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.  When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive.  Her brother is at Crows  (It seems he is sick and is in need of some Erud's Tonic.  This is a side quest).  Ask him about The Testament of Vanear.  He says yes he has it and will sell it to me for 2 gold.  If you give him the 2 gold he gives you the book which has to inventory slots and a combine button in it.   He then laughs and tells you that a thief stole pages 30 and 34 and the book is worthless without them.  He also says that the thief sold the pages to someone named Ran.  If you then ask him who Ran is he tells you that Ran Flamespinner is a librarian in Highpass.  If you go to Highpass and ask about The Testament of Vanear he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in Highpass, because he could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a hidden camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dynil Fireshine. Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport).  Beware that any smugglers around him will come to his aid.  Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard, +Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers)After going back to Qeynos, I went back to Moodoro and said I want page 34.   He said ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty smart of me to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I get it because the work is fiction anyway.  He then offers to play a game with you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card is a jester he will give you the page.  Along with the jester, you might also draw the King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight.   [Note - keep the Knights and give them to the dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward].  Once the whole thing is combined you get the Testament of Vanear, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is a no drop lore item, <B>CAN NOW BE USED</b>.  Return the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum.  Of course, if they ever activate the testament it will be worth far more on the open market.  (Submitted by Aadon)

This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest. The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last checked it out.  When you ask him, he tells you that the person who checked out the book is names Modorro and that he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.

When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive.  She'll then tell you how Moodoro got corrupted by a halfling named Flynn Merrington. They used to sell the valuable Vasty Deep Water, till Moodoro got caught.  Here's where there is a catch, part of getting to the quest requires asking a question that is not in brackets. Some people may miss it that way. Nolusia says that she created a doppleganger to die in Moodoro's place.  You must ask Nolusia 'What is a doppleganger' or 'What about the doppleganger?' Even though it is not in brackets. She'll tell you it died in Moodoro's place and he relocated to Qeynos, and that she is afraid that he's started up again because of Flynn.  Lanken Rjarn knows, and they're both afraid that the High Council will learn of it. So she wants to murder Flynn Merrington.  She wants you to return a bottle of Vasty deep water to her, so that she can poision it to give it to Flynn.   If you say yes, she tells you to find out how they get their Vasty Deep Waters and to bring a bottle to her and she will poison the lip you are then to take it to Flynn not Moodoro and that will end everything.  You can get Vasty Deep Waters by talking to the Bank manager and asking him for it  (it may be that only an enchanter can use it for this quest though). He says your guild must have sent you to get it.  Bring me a guild coin and I will give you the water.  Go back to the temple and ask for a guild coin which will be given with the message remember this is not currency.  The coin is a lore item that gives +10 mana.  Give this to the banker and he will give you the water and some experience and some faction.  Then go back and gave the water to the sister.  (Submitted by Aadon and Himmaggery)
