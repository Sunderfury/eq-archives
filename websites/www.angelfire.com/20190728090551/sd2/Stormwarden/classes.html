<p>The Bard’s stock-in-trade is their ability to play songs. Their songs are actually spells of a sort, and their magical affects last as long as the Bard continues to sing and play the correct instrument. They have some passing knowledge of the Warrior ways (mainly for self-defense), but their main focus is always their art, and so they will never be as skillful as Warriors. </p>
<p> All throughout Norrath Bards are praised for their singing and musical abilities. Because of this they are outstanding in groups and the most skilled of bards have the ability to sing up to three songs at once making them a great asset in many ways. But even from low levels they are at their best in groups as they tend to be more vulnerable then their melee counterparts when alone. </p></font>

<p>The Cleric is a holy person endowed by their patron deity with the power to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of their deity to smite foes. Prayer is how the Cleric gains their ability. </p>
<p>Clerics are possibly the most necessary part of any group of adventurers as they are rivaled by none in the art of healing. Due to their loyal service, their gods have also given them the ability to melee, cast damage spells and most importantly the ability to wear high quality armor such as plate mail. Even with all of these god given abilities, clerics are better off staying within groups as their damage capabilities are weak at best making lone adventures difficult.</p></font>

<p>A Druid is completely at home in the outdoors, and is a friend to all animals. Because of this, no animal will ever attack them unless first attacked by the Druid. They are spellcasters whose focus is all things natural, allowing them to call upon nature for aid. They share some woodland skills with their Ranger brothers. </p><p>Because Druids are healers they are often sought by groups to heal and call upon nature for their buffing abilities and damage spells. They are also sought after because of their great power to teleport groups at any given time which is an ability shared only with the wizards. Often times though a druid will be seen in wolf form adventuring alone.</p></font>

<p>The primary focus of the Enchanter’s art can be summed up by the name of the arcane order to which they belong. Their spells are specially crafted to enchant people, places, and things. This art allows them to charm beings and make them fight for their new master, or magically enhance the capabilities of a sword. They also have some skill in offensive spells, but are never as skilled as a Wizard. </p>
<p>Enchanters have some very special abilities which make them sought after by any seasoned adventurer. With their abilities to charm savage beasts and clear the minds of spellcasters they are always a necessary part of any group. Even with these great powers, Enchanters will rarely be seen alone, as their offensive spells are much weaker then their counterparts. One special ability which Enchanters share with none is their adept ability to change their appearance, this allows them access to many regions that others dare not go.</p></font>

<p>Monks are dedicated to the pursuit of shaping their bodies into a pure weapon, and because of this they nearly shun all weapons and most forms of armor. They are very religious as well, and the gods are known to bless them, not by prayers and spells, but by magically enhancing their attacks. </p>
<p class="whitetext9">Monks are considered by many to be the best melee class in all of Norrath. Some of their abilities include: kick, round kick, tiger claw, eagle strike and flying kick. Possibly their most admired ability is feign death. With this ability a monk can trick their opponent into thinking that they are dead. Monks are great in groups as they are known for their distinct ability to lure creatures one at a time. As with most of the melee classes they are also effective at adventuring alone and have the advantage of their god given skill, mend wounds.</p>

<p>Paladins have but one ability that no other in all of Norrath possess and it is quite remarkable. Their god grants them the ability to Lay Hands on themselves or someone of their choosing once per day. This effectively restores life to the fullest extent allowing for an almost dead paladin to continue on his crusade. As with most of the melee classes paladins fit in well with all groups. Although they are not as skilled as a warrior in melee, they are often found traveling alone as their gods grant them the ability to heal. </p></font>

The darker skills of picking locks and stealing are also their forte. </p>
<p>Their backstab attack is second to none and none of their melee counterparts can out damage a rogue if their target has their back towards them. A skilled rogue will also learn the arts of poisons and will inflict many forms of damage in this way.

Since they are evil, travel is sometimes hard for the Shadow Knight but they are always welcomed in groups as their melee skills are superb. Like all melee classes they can adventure alone, but lack some of the healing abilities of some of their counterparts which makes this a little more difficult.</p></font>

<p>Wizards are always welcomed in group combat as the damage of their spells is rivaled by none in all of Norrath. They also have the ability to almost instantly teleport their entire party when an emergency arises. Although their main stay is with group combat, they do have limited soloing abilities using a combination of the root line of spells and their massive damage incantations.</p></font>
