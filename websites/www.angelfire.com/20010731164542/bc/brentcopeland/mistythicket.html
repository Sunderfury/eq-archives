<A NAME=bandages>
Bandages for Honeybugger:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>  The Honeybugger brother's hand is hurt because he was swarmed by bixies while seeking honeycombs for his employer.  Give him a bandage, and he'll thank you with some XP and the following faction:  Merchants of Rivervale, Deep pockets, Guardians of the Vale and Mayor Gubbin get better and Coalition of Tradesfolk III get worse.

<A NAME=bug>
Bug Collection: </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>(All Classes)  Blixkin Entopop roams the inside of the wall and has an unusual hobby.  He collects bug parts, and you are just the halfling to help him out. Talk to him and ask him about the bug collection, and he will give you a list of six bug parts and a box to collect them in. The six bug parts for this quest are:  Spiderling eyes,  spiderling silk, Fire beetle eyes, Giant scarab egg sac (note: although there are a few giant scarabs in Misty Thicket, they're rare. I suggest getting them somewhere else), Giant fire beetle leg (these are found in the Western Karanas and sometimes on the queen klacknak),  and Giant wasp wings (these are found in Misty Thicket and camped heavily; the only other place to get them is on Crookstinger in Lesser Faydark).  After collecting the items, hit combine and give the box back to him, along with the list he gave you, for your reward.  Among the rewards he gives are a silver bracelet, a Bracelet of Beetlekind, a vial of Spider Venom and a Potion of Poison Warding, so it is generally a worthwhile quest.  you will also get the following faction changes:  Merchants of Rivervale, Deeppockets, Guardians of the Vale, and Mayor Gubbin all get better, and  Coalition of Tradefolk III gets worse.

<font color=black font size=+2>
<A NAME=eye>
Eye of Stormhammer: </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> This is the quest for the Avenger Battle Axe.  After returning the clockwork remains (Cleaner clockwork quest) to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him about the Eye of Stormguard. He will give you a letter to give to the Jail clerk near the bank of High Pass keep.  Of course the prisoner has escaped but she does give you part of the eye of stormguard, as well as info that "Bronin" has the other part, the "Emerald Shard".  Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes found in Rivervale and sometimes near the southern tower in Misty Thicket.  When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he says he will give it to you if you do a small favor.  Apparently a bounty hunter by the name of Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body, he will give you the emerald.  Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket.  He appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)!  He hops around between the Orc camp and the wall.  You may have to talk to Bronin to get him to spawn.  If you defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore item), a few gold, and the following faction adjustments:  Frogloks of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp Giants of Kurnak and Iskar get better.  When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells you that he put the emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes... and gives you a key to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold.  The key is labeled H.K.106. Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and the following faction adjustments:  Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of River Vale gets worse.  When you turn in the key in highpass bank, you get the emerald shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience, and the following adjustments: Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson McCabe all get better.   Bronin also says "There is a [second Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will need it..."  Upon further questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the Gem of Tunare, and is being held by a guild in Kelethin.  In Kelethin, go to the Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about the Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The only one who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting "at the lake near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to Dagnor's Cauldron and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his brother is a thief (and only his half brother btw...) and that he has gone to Qeynos, probably to work for the thieves guild there.  Faldor Hendrys is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he can be found walking out the front gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills zone sometimes. You need to kill him to get the gem.   Combine the parts and you get the eye of stormguard, which gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection.   If you give it to Beno, he gives you a long speach about how wonderful a warrior you are and says he is giving you a "warrior's true weapon designed by the ancient stormguard hero, Jendl Mizebrite."  He then will give you the Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice warrior only 2HS weapon.  It is likely that you need to have a very high faction with him to get the axe.

<A NAME=assassin>
Honeybugger Assasin: </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> Paziu Puno (rogue guild neriak) wants Lil Honeybugger dead and promises a "king's reward" for her head.  She lives in Misty Thicket in the Halfling territory just outside of town.  Unfortunately, she rooms with her big brother Joogl Honeybugger who never seems to leave her side, and he is probably around level 10 or so.  Since you need to be below this level to get the quest, you had better get some help in killing her.   When you kill Lil, she drops a halfling head (which is what you're supposed to bring back to Paziu Puno for your "kings reward"), a bandage (so you can reverse the faction hit you take from killing Lil by giving it to Joogl later), and a Case of Jum Jum Juice (lore item)(which I guess you can give to the treant).  Here's where this quest gets funny.  After sneaking/hiding through Rivervale and making the run back to Neriak, you need to give the halfling head to Paziu Puno.  He then tells you something to the effect of "Foolish young elf. This was no contract from King Naythox.  I wanted Lil Honeybugger killed before she gave birth to my child.  Only a naive dark elf would set foot in Halfling territory.  Here's your great reward, garbage from other guild exploits."  You get some exp,  a few cp, a minor item, and the usual rogue dark elf faction hits (better with Ebon Mask, worse with guards of qeynos, guardians of the vale, and wolves of the north).  Never trust a dark elf.  (Submitted by Thaylon)

<A NAME=jum>
Honey Jum: </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> Lil Honeybugger and her brother can be found in a lone house in the Misty Thicket.  Talk to Lil, and ask her about  the [Honey Jum Recipe].  She'll direct you to an NPC in Rivervale who owns the Herb Jar. (Just to the right of the Fool's Gold.)  This NPC will tell you  that she does, indeed, make Honey Jum, but not for free!  You must bring her 3 honeycombs and 5 gold.  Honeycombs are frequently found on Bixies and Bixie Drones.  You receive the following faction changes:  Merchants of Rivervale, Guardians of the Vale, Deep Pockets and Mayor Gubbin get better, Coalition of Tradesfolk III gets worse.

<A NAME=orc>
Orc Belts: </A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> (All Classes)  Deputy Budo, who hangs out in the guard tower in Misty Thicket just south of the opening in the wall wants you to bring him orc belts.  Give them to him one at a time for experience, faction and money.  (Submitted by Hellraiser)
