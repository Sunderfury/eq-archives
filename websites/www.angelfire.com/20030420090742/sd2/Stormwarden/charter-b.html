<div align="left"><P>1.  All guild members while in the guild Must put a good image out for our guild.<BR>
2.  The guild supports each other and those around us.  If you see 
someone who needs help, try to help.  Don't turn a blind eye.<BR>
3.  Make every attempt to attend Guild meetings when posted. Let Derkarc or any other officer aware if you are unable to attend via email, guildtalk or message post on website. Should anyone skip guild meetings or show an unwillingness to attend risk being removed from the guild.<BR>
4.  Respect the Rank of officers and their wizdom, they have been chosen for their loyalty and knowledge and are there to help. As Stormwarden members, listen to those above you. <BR>
5. Guild leader Derkarc's word is to be considered Guild Law. Anyone challanging, without due cause or reason, will risk being losing status, title and rank.<BR>
6. A council of Officers, known as Guild Eldars, will be created soon. They will embody the loyalty and leadership qualities derserving of the power and rank.<BR>
7.  Begging is not to be tolerated within the guild. Share with the guild and scorn those who beg and grovel at your feet. We are proud and nobel and will not sink to the level of scum, it is your right to refuse those who beg.<BR>
8. Never leave your corpse behind. It's not respected by other players, it won't be respected in the guild. Call for help should you seek assistance - we will all aid you in your time of need.<BR>
7.  Have fun.</P>


<P><U>Officership</U>
<P>
1. All officers are to be knowledgeable and responsible. Should you invite someone into the guild, notify Dennli with the race, class and name. Keeping an up-to-date membership list is important(see membership list on webpage).<BR>
3.  Take the time to help and assist members with their questions or problems, be a leader to your people. Never outright ignor a request from someone within the guild - situation permiting.<BR> 
4. All officers are to make allegiances with other guilds. Having allies in Norrath will aid us in accomplishing tasks, raids and are a wealth of information.<BR>
5.  Use common sense. Try not to act foolishly as you represent the guild. Use the powers of council in the ways it was meant to be used.</P>
<P><I>Footnote:
Don't beg for officer status, asking about it fine, but begging is a no no.  It goes against our polices and only diminishes your credibility. Guild leader Derkarc has given temporary officer status to a few until a ruling council is chosen. Show your leadership qualities, prove yourself and the council will review all those who desire officer status.</I></P>
