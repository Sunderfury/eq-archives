  per level and how long you can fight before you become fatigued.
<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Agility</FONT></B> - chance for creatures to miss or for you to avoid hits(probably). Keep this stat over 75 and you're fine.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Intelligence</FONT></B> - higher int might help with 
  faster skill gain, can be beneficial if you want to use ALL weapon skills. Better 
  off not throwing any bonus points into this one. 
<P> <B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Charisma</FONT></B> - affects prices for items you 
  buy from npc's..also not worth any bonus points since most of your armor/weapons 
  will be from players or as loot from something you killed. Increases ability 
  to resist mind altering spells such as charm.
<P> <B><FONT COLOR=#ffff80>Wisdom</FONT></B> - Supposedly helps your attempts to
