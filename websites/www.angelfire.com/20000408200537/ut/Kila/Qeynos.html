<FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=6 >Both filled with horror and intrigue, I decided I wanted to visit other areas of Norrath before I woke up from this change of perspective.
I went to the other side of the world first. Qeynos....</FONT>
<br><BR><BR><BR><IMG SRC="qeynos1.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=5 COLOR=808000>I awoke at the
 bank in Qeynos and took a city-wide tour.<br> This is the pool near the bank.<br><br><br><br>
<IMG SRC="qeynos2.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br>I ran out to the docks to 
admire the fluid movement of the ocean but was stopped by the new decor of the Mermaid's 
Lure...<br><br><br><br><IMG SRC="qeynos4.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br>This Woman was standing on the dock. I was amused by the eyes all over her body.<br><br><br><br>
<IMG SRC="qeynos3.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br>After fleeing in terror from the Docks, I re-entered Qeynos via the square. <br>
Though these pictures are neat,they do not completely encompass <br> how alien this environment that had 
been so familiar had become. This image stopped me for a few minutes...<br><br><br><br><IMG SRC="qeynos5.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br>I decided to gate out to the main Qeynos entrance. <br>
When I arrived I was facing the plains heading out towards the hills.<br>
The Plains were such a site that I was dumbstruck again by the chaos when I finally DID <br>turn around
 and face the gates to Qeynos itself!<br><br><br>

<IMG SRC="qeycat1.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=5><FONT COLOR="808000">I decided to seek some peace by escaping below into the Catacombs beneath the city.
I knew immediately upon slipping behind the ivy-covered passageway that Peace was not what I would find below...<br><br><br><br><IMG SRC="qeycat2.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0>
<br>I attempted to relax by taking a nice swim, but the scintillating colors in the water made my mind Swirl!!!<br><br><br><br><br><IMG SRC="qeycat4.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br>Finally, to prevent my own drowning, I retreated from the waters in search of some shadow in which to rest inside the city itself!<br><br><br><br>



<IMG SRC="qeynos6.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br>At this point I was getting a little sensorily overload.<br>I ran to Sneed's for some water but was greeted by this new effacement of his shop!
<br><br><br><br><IMG SRC="qeynos7.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br> In my panicked running I ran thru the zone towards the Bank again.<br> I stopped at the clock to catch the time but...<br><br><br> 
</BODY><IMG SRC="qeynos8.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br> Back at the bank I became aware that Night had fallen. <br>The moon was full enough to cloud anyone's mind!<br><br><br><br><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=6 COLOR=Turquoise >
I opted to move on...Perhaps the twisting of my reality had marked me for I felt an evil in my center and when I went to sleep that night I dreamt I was a Dark Elf!.....<br><br><br><br><br><br>
