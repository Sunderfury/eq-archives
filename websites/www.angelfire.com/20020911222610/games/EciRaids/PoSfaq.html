<p align="left"><br>
<br>
Here resides the Thunder Spirits and Thunder Spirit Princess, as
well as the Key Master and Quest Efreetis. The Thunder Spirit
Princess is the boss of this island, and when killed, will spawn
Sirran the Lunatic, who will produce keys for you to get to the
next island.<br>
<br>
The Thunder Spirit Princess and Key Master are located in the
center of the island, near to where you zone in. The Thunder
Spirits float along the edge of the island, out of aggro range of
the Princess. (Note: The Princess and Spirits (also known as
Faeries), look like the faeries found in Greater and Lesser
Faydark.) The Quest Efreetis reside in a cavern found inside the
island. There are three Portals located on the edges of the
Island, to the east (which leads to Azarack Island), to the north
(which leads to Noble Island), and to the west (which leads to
the Quest Efreetis). <br>
<br>
Everything on this island is indifferent, and will only retaliate
if attacked. The Thunder Spirits are social, and thus will attack
if they see you fighting one of their friends. The Key Master
will not attack if he sees you engaged with the Spirits. Do not
use any AoE spells, duel, or cast any offensive spells on another
PC, as this will aggro the Quest Efreetis, which will wipe you
and 1 or 2 others out in seconds. <br>
<br>
The Thunder Spirits aren't hard at all, and only require 1 or 2
groups to kill. You'll only have to fight one at a time as long
as you have a good puller. They hit for around 160, are 51-52,
have comparatively low resists and HP. They proc a &quot;Choke&quot;
spell which seems to take away 10 STR from their target. <br>
<br>
Start at the East portal, and work your way clock-wise. Either
pull to the group at the East Portal, or make the group move to
each Faerie. Make sure you dont stand too far away when
attacking, or you may aggro other Faeries, or even the Princess
herself. If you should aggro the Princess before you are ready
for her, let everyone die and a Cleric can ress everyone back.
You dont want to kill her before all the Faeries are dead. <br>
<br>
When the Faeries die, make sure each Lost Rabbits Foot is looted
-- these are used to make the Keys to Azarack Isle. The Mini-Sword
is used to make a key to the Noble Isle, which usually is un-needed.
They also drop different Tesseras (Auburn Tessera, etc), which
are used for various quests in the Plane. <br>
<br>
When all the Faeries have died, and everyone has looted a Rabbits
Foot, buff up and attack the Thunder Spirit Princess. She hits
for 200+, is level 52+, and has moderate resistances and HP. She
procs the &quot;Choke&quot; spell, exactly the same as the lesser
Thunder Spirits. She usually does not drop anything, but she may
drop one rare item such as melee haste belts or caster bracers.
When she dies, Sirran the Lunatic, a halfling, will spawn. Do not
hail him, or engage him in conversation (make sure no one says
&quot;What hassle?&quot;, as this will make him attack the person
immediately. Sirran hits for over 2000 damage each round).
Everyone that has looted a Rabbits Foot should hand it to Sirran
now, and he will give you back the Key of the Misplaced, which
will take you to Azarack Isle. If you'd like to go to the Noble
Island, hand in a Mini-Sword now, which will result in a Key of
Swords. These keys are no-rent, and will disappear if you zone
out, die, or log after using them once. The key components will
disappear only if you zone out, but not if you die. Both the keys
and key components are no-drop. If you do not have enough keys
after killing the Thunder Spirits, you can buy them from the Key
Master at an inflated price. </p>

<p align="left">A good way to test tactics for the Azarack Island
before you actually go over is to pull multiple Thunder Spirits
at once and have them swarm you, just like with the Azaracks. The
ideal way to do this is to set 2 groups as 'heavy tank' groups,
and have them ready to pull the adds off of the main group and
tank them, while the 'primary' groups finish the main target. If
you're going to pull 3 at once, you need 4 total groups -- 2
groups to act as heavy tanks for the 2 adds, and 2 groups to act
as primary assaults for the main target. Have the puller pull one
Spirit first, and all the groups will engage it. Within a few
seconds, have the puller pull another Spirit, and the first heavy
tank group will engage it, while the primary groups stay on the
first target. A few seconds later, pull the final Spirit, and the
second heavy tank group will jump off the primary target and
engage their Spirit. Meanwhile, the primary groups will have the
first Spirit nearly dead, while the Spirit adds did not wreak
carnage amongst the clerics and casters, thus saving everyone's
life, while keeping the battle under control. Then the primary
groups would switch to the first heavy tank groups target until
it died, and switch to the final target. This is how Plane fights
work for the most part when an Enchanter cannot mezz and the
targets cannot be kited. An adaptation of this strategy will be
used on the Azarack Island, as well as several others in the
Plane of Sky. These strategies will be explored in depth in later
volumes.<br>
<br>
The Key Master, a dorf in full steel residing in the middle of
the island, sells various items which will be useful on your trip
to the Plane of Sky. The Key of Swords (500 pp) will take you to
the Noble Isle, the Key of the Misplaced (250 pp) will take you
to Azarack Isle, and Veeshan's Key (1 cp) will take you to the
Quest Efreetis. The Key Master also sells Coffins for summoning
bodies (175 pp), a Box of the Void (1 gp) and various Mana
Batteries, from Series I to V (250 - 1250 pp). The Box of Void is
believed to be used in conjunction with Mana Batteries to
recharge quest items that have come from the Plane of Sky. Place
the item you wish to recharge, along with the mana battery that
corresponds to the number of charges you wish to give the item,
into the Box of Void, and combine. This *should* result in a
recharged item. The Key Master also Death Touches when attacked,
which is useful for leaving corpses on the island. <br>
<br>
The Quest Efreetis are located in a cavern underneath the actual
Key Master Island. To get to them, buy a Veeshan's Key from the
Key Master (1 cp), and go to the Portal to the left of the Key
Master (facing him). Step inside the Portal and take the key from
your inventory. Looking down at the base of the Portal, left-click
the key on the base of the Portal (Note: This is just like
opening locked doors in Befallen). You will instantly teleport
down to the Quest Efreeti room. Here resides an Efreeti for each
class. When hailed, they will ask if you wish to summon a person
of great reknown from your class. When one is summoned, the
person will give you three quests which can be completed by
handing him items from the Plane of Sky. Each class receives 6
quests, except for Paladins, whom receive 5, and Shadow Knights,
whom receive 7. Inte Akera, an essential NPC for the Fiery
Avenger quest, is summoned from this room by talking to Dirkog.
There is no way out of the room, once you are finished, except to
jump off the platform and out of the Plane altogether. It would
be prudent to leave a corpse on the Key Master island, go down to
the Quest Efreetis, and when you are finished, have someone
revive you back to the top of the island. <br>

This should give everyone a pretty good idea of what to expect
when zoning into the Plane of Sky. This will be the shortest
volume of the series, as it is in fact the easiest and least
complicated of all the islands in the Plane of Sky. =) <br>
<br>
Next up is Volume II: The Azarack Island. <br>
