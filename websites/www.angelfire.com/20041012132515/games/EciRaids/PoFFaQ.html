<p align="left"><br>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="5"><strong>Introduction</strong></font><font
color="#FFFFFF"><strong> </strong></font><br>
I have only one point to make here, and will be brief to stress
it: Learn the rules of Fearplane. If you break a rule, YOU will
cause the death of the entire party. YOU can potentially turn a
successful raid into a ten hour corpse retrieval that ends with
GM intervention. YOU are not an asset, but a liability to the
entire raid if you go into Fear without learning the rules.
Education can make you useful. Please take the time to learn some
key points in this guide. Not only will they save your life, but
they will drastically increase the chances at having a successful
raid. Having said that, we can proceed to the Plane and how to
get in successfully. <br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"><strong>Meet the Enemy</strong></font><strong>:</strong>
<br>
To begin, all of the mobs in Fear can hit in the 130+ range. They
have an abnormally high aggro radius and sometimes aggro from out
of sight. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Amygdalan Knight </font></p>

<p align="left">The Amygdalan Knight is a Shadowknight as the
name implies. It resembles a large Ricky Williams, dreadlocks and
all. They come complete with useless (although annoying) pets.
The Knights drop Shadowknight-only armor (Umbral Platemail)
Special Skills : Harm Touch, Mana Drain <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Amygdalan Warrior</font> </p>

<p align="left">The Amygdalan Warrior is just a Knight minus harm
touch and pet. These also Mana drain. The Warriors drop Warrior-only
Shield and Whip. Special Skills: none <br>
*<font size="4">Fetid Fiend (male)</font> </p>

<p align="left">Resembles a huge zombie. Just a basic level 50
mob that drops Paladin-only armor (Valorium). Special Skills :
Disease <br>
<br>
<font size="4">*Fetid Fiend (female)</font></p>

<p align="left">Resembles one of those Tormented Dead from the
yard in Unrest. Basic level 50 mob. Drops Cleric-only Girdle of
the Diligent. Special Skills: none <br>
<br>
*<font size="4">Boogeyman </font></p>

<p align="left">Resembles a huge Ghoul. Basic level 50 mob. Drops
Necromancer-only armor (Blighted). Special Skills: Ghoulroot <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Glare Lord</font> </p>

<p align="left">Resembles an evil eye. Glare Lords are
enchanters, although I have never seen one charm anyone. They
come with Enchanter pets and drop wands for Mages and Enchanters.
What makes them annoying is the AE debuff that strips 4 buffs (sorry
Shamans). Special Skills: AE debuff <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Frightfinger</font> &#150;</p>

<p align="left">Resembles a very small Reanimated Hand from Lower
Guk or Unrest. Fingers use wizard spells and drop Wizard-only
armor (Carmine). Special Skills: Wizard spells <br>
<br>
<font size="4">*Turmoil Toad</font> </p>

<p align="left">Resemble small Froglock ghouls that can be found
in Najena or Lower Guk. Toads drop Turmoil Warts (decent throwing
weapon), and Shaman-only belt (Flayed Turmoilskin). Special
Skills: Ghoulroot <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Spinechiller Spider</font> </p>

<p align="left">Spiders are basic level 50 mobs with a cold based
DOT which only hits for 300 in 30 ticks. Spiders drop all caster
gear (Cryosilk). Special Skills: Spinechill (DOT) <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Scareling</font> </p>

<p align="left">These little critters look like little imps from
Solsek B Efreeti area or Kindle in Solsek A. They are rogues and
backstab for 400+. These are VERY deadly and always the first
target when one is in the camp. Another deadly tactic of the
Scareling is to teleport anyone to a random location (not too far
away) potentially starting a massive train leading to a total
wipe out of the raiding party. Repeat, Scarelings must die, and
die fast. Scarelings drop a rogue-only rapier (Eyerazzia).
Special Skills: Backstab, Teleport <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Gorgon</font> &#150;</p>

<p align="left">Gorgons resemble Harpies from Steamfont
mountains, but with snakes coming out of their heads. They can
stun a target for over 15 seconds. Gorgons drop Druid-only armor
(Vermiculated). Special Skills: Stun <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Tentacle Tormentor </font></p>

<p align="left">Tormentors resemble their weaker cousins from
Unrest and Najena. The use the normal throwback spell as well as
the normal lifetap spell. They also have that annoying AE strip
enchantment that removes 4 buffs. If there are enough Paladins in
the group, it is possible to keep these chain-stunned through the
entire battle, preventing them from using the AE debuff.
Tormentors drop Ranger-only Armor (Thorny Vine) and a Druid-only
Belt (Dreamorvine Garland). Special Skills: Throwback, Lifetap,
AE debuff. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">*Phantasm </font></p>

<p align="left">Phantasms resemble spectres. Normal level 50 mob.
Drops nothing of note. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Phoboplasm</font> </p>

<p align="left">Often called &#145;jello&#146;, these resemble
gelatinous cubes from Splitpaw of old, or Runnyeye. They are
located in the temple of Cazic Thule. They also have an AE
debuff, but it only removes 1 buff. Jello are loved by all
because they can randomly drop any piece of planar armor in the
game, including armor for classes such as rogues, bards, clerics,
and warriors which is normally found in the Plane of Hate. There
are conflicting reports as to whether jello can truly drop ANY
piece, or just 1 piece from each class (i.e. Cleric Boots, Bard
Bracer, Paladin Bracer, Warrior Gauntlets, etc.) Special Skills:
AE Debuff <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Worry Wraith</font> </p>

<p align="left">Looks like a giant will-o-wisp with pet. If these
are not dispelled, they have a damage shield that can cause many
people to go linkdead from the amount of &#145;Billy was burned&#146;
messaages. Other than that, they are garden variety level 50 mobs
with a pet. Special Skills: none <br>
<br>
<font size="4">*Samhien </font></p>

<p align="left">Resembles a jack-o-lantern from the yard of
Unrest, or a scarecrow from the farms in West Karana. Another
normal level 50 or so mob. Can drop (rarely) Ranger-only Axe (Fluxbladed
Axe). Special Skills: none <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Nightmare</font> </p>

<p align="left">Looks like a big black horse and squeaks like a
rusty swingset. They can blind as well as fear. Drop the
Nightmare Hide Cloak (garbage). Special Skills: Blindness and
Fear. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Shiverback</font> </p>

<p align="left">Looks like a big ape from Cazic Thule. Hit hard
and fast. Drop Monk-only armor (Shiverback Hide). Special Skills:
none <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Dracoliche</font> </p>

<p align="left">This looks like a huge Ashenbone Drake from Plane
of Hate. If you have never seen one of those, you have never seen
anything that looks like a Dracoliche. All I can say is that it
looks like Vox or Nagafen died, decomposed, then returned to life
with just its bones. This is Cazic Thule&#146;s number one
guardian. This bone dragon is a shadowknight with a pet.
Attacking the Dracoliche always aggros Cazic Himself, and
throughout the battle with Draco, Cazic will be death-touching
constantly, as well as sending in reinforcements. He has a mean
disease based DOT and dragon roar (AE fear). Leave it to Verant
to make a bone dragon, call it a liche, and NOT make it undead.
Although he sounds scary, I have fought him six times and he has
only gotten me once because he sneaked up on us when we were
unprepared. After the Draco fight, everyone will have to log out,
wait 1 minute and log back in unless other specified by the raid
leader. Draco spawns once a real-life week. Special Skills: DOT
and dragon roar. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Fright, Dread, and Terror </font></p>

<p align="left">These are Cazic Thule&#146;s little buddies that
have temples located around the zone. They are large golems.
Fighting any one of these will also aggro Cazic. They drop
nothing but some spare change. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Cazic Thule</font> </p>

<p align="left">Cazic is a God. Cazic is a vengeful God. Cazic
does not like people. Cazic does not like you. In general, he is
a level 55 mob that has several irritating quirks. First, he hits
for 400 and double attacks. Second, he uses gravity flux like it
is going out of style. Every time you are fluxed, it removes one
buff. (Put j-boots in top buff slot and reactivate after every
flux.) Third, Cazic has pets. Not a typo, plural pets. And they
are fairly irritating, although nothing to lose sleep over.
Special Skills: Gravity Flux, strong melee, debuff. <br>
<br>
Last, but not least, the most fearsome of all of the enemies in
Fearplane&#133;&#133; <br>
<br>
Someone who does not follow the Fearplane rules &#150; This enemy
is in your ranks. He could even be grouped with you. This enemy
is fearsome because of its ability to kill 50+ people within 3
minutes. Special Skills: Trainmaking <br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"><strong>Raid Requirements</strong></font><br>
First off, the raid should never exceed 7 full groups. The lag in
a fully populated fearplane is incredible, and increases
exponentially with over 42 people. If there are more people that
want to go, there is ample opportunity for them to support the
troops outside the portal. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Tanks (and a lot of them)</font> </p>

<p align="left">Tanks in the raid need to get out their old armor
class gear and dust it off. On the initial attempt, armor class
is key. Mobs in there hit for 130+, as stated previously, and the
more hits you can take, the longer you can stay alive to support
the casters. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Clerics</font> </p>

<p align="left">Each group going in really needs to have at least
one cleric. Druids and Shamans do not substitute in this instance.
They will be very occupied in other capacities inside such as
charming and blasting. You need a devoted healer that has only
one objective : Keep everyone alive as long as possible. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Druids and Shamans</font></p>

<p align="left">Druids are essential for the raiding party. They
can charm animal mobs that enter the camp without invitation,
turning a foe into a nice level 50 pet. Shamans can Togor mobs
and drastically reduce the amount of damage dealt by them, as
well as Malosi them to allow the casters to work more effectively.
<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Necromancers</font> </p>

<p align="left">Necros perform a dual role in a break. First of
all, the break involves having some key positions occupied by
characters that are feigned; Second, necros can charm the undead
mobs that enter the camp without warning, again turning a foe
into a very nice pet. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Enchanters</font> </p>

<p align="left">Enchaters are the king of the debuffs, and this
just may tip the scales in your favor, allowing you to eliminate
a few mobs. They can also mezmerize mobs that enter the camp that
cannot be charmed by either necros or druids (i.e. Scarelings and
Amys). Clarity may also make the difference by allowing that one
extra blast, or that one extra heal. Some battles last upwards of
10 minutes, and clarity is very effective in these circumstances.
<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Magicians</font> </p>

<p align="left">Every raid needs a magician. After the initial
rush, the melee types wont have gear any more. They will need
many things summoned including food, water and weapons. The mage
is a key component of the raid. <br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"><strong>Preparation</strong> </font><br>
1. All tanks need to be bound in Ogguk at the entrance. If the
raid has rangers, the rangers can spirit of wolf the people that
arrive in Ogguk after they are killed inside. If there are no
rangers on the raid (although highly unlikely), at least one
druid or shaman needs to bind in Ogguk also to SoW the newly dead
troops to get past the bouncers outside. Also, someone that can
cast a light spell is needed, as Feerott is a dark place already,
and the humans and erudites that need to get back to the portal
cant see anything at all. <br>
2. All casters that can bind, do so by the rock right outside of
the portal. That area is void of wandering skeletons that always
seem to show up right when you respawn back outside. <br>
3. Cyndereela : Cyn is the necro that guards the portal into Fear.
Ideally, a group of people may be camping her for experience. If
not, designate a few people to kill her when she spawns. She is
dangerous only because she can see invisible, and will attack
people zoning in, thereby rendering them visible. Visible = BAD. <br>
4. Buff me! : Every party must be composed of tanks and at least
one cleric, and ideally, one druid. On the initial rush, the
buffs are as follows: <br>
</p>

<p align="left">Tanks : Resolution, Shield of Words, Symbol of
Pinzarn or Naltron, Talisman of Altuna, Stamina, Levitate or Dead
Man Floating, See Invisible, and finally Superior Camouflage.
Strength and Agility are also nice, as is Dexterity for tanks
with weapons that proc. <br>
<br>
Priests : All of the above buffs except strength and dexterity.
They can get clarity instead. <br>
<br>
Casters : Same as Priests. <br>
<br>
This is where some of the extra people can come in to the picture.
If there are more than 42 people, the extra people can stand
outside the portal and hold gems for symbols and shield skin,
food and water, etc. for the troops that will be back shortly
naked. Extra people can also be buffers. All of the buffs take
time and mana away from the people going inside. Extra people
outside to aid in the buffing can be very helpful. <br>
<br>
5. Feign Death : At least 2 people are going to need to get
inside and feign death in 2 key locations. The first person will
go inside and feign death right at the portal. This person is
responsible for letting the people on the outside know when the
portal area is clear of wandering mobs. When the portal area is
clear, and there is a safe route to the west camp, the second
person will enter and proceed to the west camp and feign there.
This person serves a dual purpose. First, they notify the raiders
when the camp is clear. Second, they serve as a beacon to let the
raiders know where to go upon entering the Plane. Therefore the
second person who feigns must know exactly where the camp needs
to be established. <br>
6. The Gathering : When everyone is buffed and the two inside are
in place safely, everyone must gather in front of the portal and
await the charge command. The raid leader must designate the
order of the groups to enter, and groups will enter 10 seconds
apart. At this point, it is very important to be camouflaged at
all times as the charge command can come at any time. <br>
7. The assist hotkey : The raid leader will announce who the main
and secondary tanks are. You may have been in situations before
when you said to yourself &#145;I don&#146;t need to make an
assist key, I can see what they are attacking and hit it.&#146;
This is not one of those times. You MUST make your assist hotkey
for the tanks. If you don&#146;t know how to make a hotkey, for
the love of Mithanial Marr, ask someone. <br>
</p>

<p align="left"><br>
<font size="5"><strong>The First Rush </strong></font><br>
1. YOU WILL DIE!!! This point cannot be stressed enough. Do not
think that by using some sneaky tactic, or superior knowledge you
can survive. This mentality only hurts the group and causes the
raid to fail. Go in there KNOWING that you are about to emerge
naked at your bind point. That being said, go in there DETERMINED
to live as long as possible, and kill as much as you can. <br>
</p>

<p align="left">2. When the people inside give the go-ahead, you
must act fast. Group 1 zones into fearplane, takes a 90 degree
turn left, runs down the hill to the wall where the person is
feigned. After group 1, group 2 goes in 10 seconds later and
heads to the camp, repeat the process with all groups. This is
where the raid can succeed or fail. The first minute can
determine the success of the raid, as the two most important
rules apply here. They are : <br>
</p>

<p align="left">A. If you are attacked outside of camp, STAND AND
DIE!!! In case someone missed that, let me rephrase it&#133;.
STOP MOVING, DO NOT RUN TO CAMP, DO NOT RUN AWAY FROM CAMP, DO
NOT RUN ANYWHERE!!! If ONE single person disregards this rule,
the raid is a failure. I am not being overly dramatic, this is
fact. If you run, two things can happen. If you run TO the camp,
you bring a nice train of mobs with you. Because of the increased
aggro range, you WILL bring a train. When this happens, everyone
will die, including you. You might even lose your corpse. For
this reason, it is in YOUR best interest to stand and die,
thereby increasing the chances of the success of the raid. If you
run AWAY from camp, a phenomenon called chain-aggro happens and
mobs crawl out from under rocks and behind trees and get all
stirred up, resulting in a mass of wandering mobs. This will also
get everyone killed. To reiterate, DO NOT RUN ANYWHERE&#133;STAND
AND DIE. If it makes you feel better, turn away from the computer
while you die. <br>
</p>

<p align="left">B. Second cardinal rule : STAY TOGETHER IN CAMP.
Do not wander even 5 steps away from everyone else. You need to
get into a tight little ball with your friends. I don&#146;t care
if they smell. <br>
</p>

<p align="left">3. At this time, hopefully everyone has followed
the above rules, and everyone is huddled in the camp, waiting for
the onslaught. When the first wanderer comes by, it will aggro,
and can aggro from near the portal. If you can see it, it could
be in camp within 10 seconds. If you cant see it, it can be in
camp in 10.6 seconds. When the first mob enters the camp, the
main tank will acquire the target, attack, and call for assist.
Everyone attack the same mob. EVERYONE. Blasters blast, tanks
tank, clerics heal, shamans togor and malosi, enchanters tashani.
<br>
</p>

<p align="left">4. Adds : If you are killing a mob and see
another come into the camp, shout ADD &lt;blank&gt; to ensure
that everyone knows there are more mobs. If the tank then chooses
a new target, he will shout and you have to assist again to
acquire the new target. For instance, if you are fighting a
Shiverback, and a Scareling wanders into camp, the main tank will
most likely switch to the Scareling, unless the ape is almost
dead. The main tank will decide what the proper target is, and
you need to follow the lead tank. Do not attempt to kite adds at
this point. <br>
</p>

<p align="left">5. Teleports : As mentioned earlier, Scarelings
can teleport you away from the camp. If this happens, regain you
bearings, get the camp in sight, and then look around. Make 110%
sure you have not aggroed any more mobs. If you have been
aggroed, STAND AND DIE. Do not run back to camp, as this will
result in another train. <br>
</p>

<p align="left">6. Death : Eventually the clerics will run out of
mana. The blasters will be out also. The tanks will start
dropping one by one. Fight to the death. Every mob killed on the
initial break is a huge accomplishment. If you can get 4-5 mobs
dead on the first rush, consider yourself in. Might take a few
more deaths, but you can get in. <br>
<font size="5"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="5"><strong>Subsequent Rushes </strong></font><br>
1. So you died. You land in either Ogguk or right outside the
portal. If you land in Ogguk, get a SoW and get back to the
portal. DO NOT ZONE IN. Before training the spectres to the
portal, might be a nifty idea to be sure there and people there
to derail the train. <br>
</p>

<p align="left">2. Get summoned : Get the mage to start summoning
swords and food / water. About 5 food and water per person is
fine, and either sword or modulating rod for a weapon. Sit down
and start getting buffs together for the second try. <br>

<p align="left">3. Basically the same as the initial rush, when
called in, proceed in an orderly fashion to the camp and get in a
ball. If you are attacked on the way, STOP AND DIE. <br>
</p>

<p align="left">4. Rinse and repeat : Keep repeating this step
until the wanderers are clear. Conflicting reports, but I think
there are 12 wanderers that need to be dispatched. <br>
<br>
<font size="5"><strong>Establishing the West Camp</strong> </font><br>
Not really much to be said here, except that you must still
follow the main 2 rules. This is not a time for exploration. You
have killed the wanderers in the area, and your camp is
relatively safe. If you wander, you WILL train, and trust me,
there are still enough mobs in the zone to kill every level 46
&#150; 50 person on the server at once. <br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"><strong>Cazic Thule says &#145;BURNS&#146;</strong></font><strong>
</strong><br>
When you see this, it means that Cazic Thule is kind of annoyed
with the entire concept of people &#145;raiding&#146; his plane,
and he decided to take matters into his own hands. If the person
who gets the death touch was in the west camp at that time, Cazic
Thule now is aggro on the entire camp and will begin to death
touch someone every 30 seconds or so. When this happens, you will
have to do one of two things: <br>
If you are fighting something, kill it and kill it fast. After
that, watch for the raid leader to call the CAMP command. When
you see this, sit and camp, and pray you save your ass. Leave the
game for 3 minutes, then return to the game. This will clear the
Cazic aggro on the party. <br>
If you are not fighting, just look for the camp command. Do not
camp until requested to do so. The leader makes that decision,
and you will look like a cowardly fool if you camp out with no
command only to find that the person that caught the death touch
was not in the camp. Save some embarrassment and wait for the
signal. </p>

<p align="left"><br>
<br>
<font size="5"><strong>Clearing the Zone </strong></font><br>
Basically this just consists of the pull team going out and
grabbing mobs and dragging them back to the camp for a slaughter.
Do not go after mobs, let them come to you. If you see the puller
run by with a huge train, do not attack the train. Let the pull
team pick them off of the train one-by-one and take them to the
camp. I repeat, do NOT attack the train. <br>
</p>

<font size="5"><strong>The Dracoliche</strong> </font><br>
Big dragon, &#145;nuff said. Before the Draco pull, you need to
buff up as usual and throw on some sv disease and magic buffs.
Kill the dragon, you probably have done something like this
before. After the dragon is dead, wait for the camp command. When
you see it, camp and return in however many minutes the leader
specifies. Do not check the Draco for loot. Let the leader of the
raid take care of this. The leader is experienced, knows what the
Draco drops, can tell at a quick glance what is NO DROP and what
is not, can loot the droppable items, and handle the situation.
When you have safely killed the Draco, please do me a favor : Do
not shout WHAT WAS THE LOOT&gt;??&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;?? And WHAT
DID HE HAVE??? It really annoys everyone and you will find out
soon enough. It is considerate to wait for everyone to be back
into the Plane before you announce the loot. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"><strong>The Man of the Hour, Cazic Thule Himself </strong></font><br>
Pretty easy for a God if I do say so myself. Buff up for him like
any other Dragon or God. This is done by : <br>
<br>
1. Dispelling ALL buffs you have on you at the time <br>
</p>

<p align="left">2. When given the signal, place 2 disposable
buffs on yourself. My personal preference is to use J-Boots
first, as you can quickly reactivate them after they are debuffed.
At the command, begin normal buffs. Put Dead Man Floating as the
final buff, as this negates his Gravity Flux damage. Wait for the
call, and charge him and kill him. Not really much to it. Please
see above comments about asking what loot was. <br>
<br>

<p align="left"><font size="5"><strong>Epilogue </strong></font><br>
You have killed the entire Plane of Fear. Give yourself a pat on
the back. Please congratulate the winners of the prizes. Even if
you really wanted the item, how would you like it if someone
frowned when you won something? If all went well, you have about
1-2 hours before the zone pops again (13-14 hour cycle). If you
want to farm the zone, head back to the west camp and proceed to
pull mobs as they pop for the next week or so until a patch (or
recently, till tomorrow as we get patches almost every day). Or,
something that is a little more fun, wait till tomorrow and do
the entire thing again. It is much more rewarding to go into a
place where the odds are against you and overcome the odds, than
to sit for hours and hours arguing about loot and waiting for one
poor mob to spawn so 40 people can beat the mess out of it. I
hope this helps some people that want to go to Fear understand
what is going on there. I hope this takes some of the &#145;Fear&#146;
out of Fearplane, and removes the panic factor which can ruin
everyone&#146;s time, as well as kill everyone. <br>
