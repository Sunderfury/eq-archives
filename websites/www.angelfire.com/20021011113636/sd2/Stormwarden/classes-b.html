<p>The Bard’s stock-in-trade is their ability to play songs. Their songs are actually spells of a sort, and their magical affects last as long as the Bard continues to sing and play the correct instrument. They have some passing knowledge of the Warrior ways (mainly for self-defense), but their main focus is always their art, and so they will never be as skillful as Warriors. </p>
<p> All throughout Norrath Bards are praised for their singing and musical abilities. Because of this they are outstanding in groups and the most skilled of bards have the ability to sing up to three songs at once making them a great asset in many ways. But even from low levels they are at their best in groups as they tend to be more vulnerable then their melee counterparts when alone. </p></font>

<p>The Cleric is a holy person endowed by their patron deity with the power to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of their deity to smite foes. Prayer is how the Cleric gains their ability. </p>
<p>Clerics are possibly the most necessary part of any group of adventurers as they are rivaled by none in the art of healing. Due to their loyal service, their gods have also given them the ability to melee, cast damage spells and most importantly the ability to wear high quality armor such as plate mail. Even with all of these god given abilities, clerics are better off staying within groups as their damage capabilities are weak at best making lone adventures difficult.</p></font>

<p>A Druid is completely at home in the outdoors, and is a friend to all animals. Because of this, no animal will ever attack them unless first attacked by the Druid. They are spellcasters whose focus is all things natural, allowing them to call upon nature for aid. They share some woodland skills with their Ranger brothers. </p><p>Because Druids are healers they are often sought by groups to heal and call upon nature for their buffing abilities and damage spells. They are also sought after because of their great power to teleport groups at any given time which is an ability shared only with the wizards. Often times though a druid will be seen in wolf form adventuring alone.</p></font>

<p>The primary focus of the Enchanter’s art can be summed up by the name of the arcane order to which they belong. Their spells are specially crafted to enchant people, places, and things. This art allows them to charm beings and make them fight for their new master, or magically enhance the capabilities of a sword. They also have some skill in offensive spells, but are never as skilled as a Wizard. </p>
<p>Enchanters have some very special abilities which make them sought after by any seasoned adventurer. With their abilities to charm savage beasts and clear the minds of spellcasters they are always a necessary part of any group. Even with these great powers, Enchanters will rarely be seen alone, as their offensive spells are much weaker then their counterparts. One special ability which Enchanters share with none is their adept ability to change their appearance, this allows them access to many regions that others dare not go.</p></font>

arts, and wield the power to call forth everything from a simple loaf of bread to a huge Fire Elemental to fight for them. While not as adept at offensive spells as the Wizards, Magicians still wield considerable power in this area as well. </p>
<p>Mages have the great ability to summon up 
a warrior of sorts in the guise of an elemental. With the aid 
of their elemental and the power of their damage spells mages 
are a definite benefit to any group, but they can often be found 
adventuring with just their pet at their sides.</p></font>

<p>Monks are dedicated to the pursuit of shaping their bodies into a pure weapon, and because of this they nearly shun all weapons and most forms of armor. They are very religious as well, and the gods are known to bless them, not by prayers and spells, but by magically enhancing their attacks. </p>
<p class="whitetext9">Monks are considered by many to be the best melee class in all of Norrath. Some of their abilities include: kick, round kick, tiger claw, eagle strike and flying kick. Possibly their most admired ability is feign death. With this ability a monk can trick their opponent into thinking that they are dead. Monks are great in groups as they are known for their distinct ability to lure creatures one at a time. As with most of the melee classes they are also effective at adventuring alone and have the advantage of their god given skill, mend wounds.</p>

<p>These are the dark brotherhood of the arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spiritually based spells, they are able to animate dead bodies and skeletons to do their bidding, as well as having spells which leach life from their victims.</p>
<p>Dabbling in death does have it's price as 
the necromancer finds travel somewhat difficult in Norrath. Even 
with this limitation, they are very effective in group combat. 
Armed with some of the best damage over time spells they can often times be found traveling with just their undead companions by their sides.</p></Font>

<p>Paladins are the very picture of a holy knight, fighting for the cause of good in all aspects of his life. As such they share some of the healing and spell powers of a Cleric, and a good deal of the fighting ability of a Warrior. As a hybrid class the Paladin have few powers all their own. </p>
<p>Paladins have but one ability that no other in all of Norrath possess and it is quite remarkable. Their god grants them the ability to Lay Hands on themselves or someone of their choosing once per day. This effectively restores life to the fullest extent allowing for an almost dead paladin to continue on his crusade. As with most of the melee classes paladins fit in well with all groups. Although they are not as skilled as a warrior in melee, they are often found traveling alone as their gods grant them the ability to heal. </p></font>

a Druid, sharing some of the skills of both. Considered to be one of the 'Tank' classes, they are exellent in a melee and lend aid in combat with druid-like buffs. Outdoors are the home to the Ranger.</p>
<p class="whitetext9">Rangers are one of the few in Norrath who posses the ability to track. Because of this skill, they are highly sought after by any seasoned adventuring party, especially in the outside regions of Norrath. Rangers can dual wield and also have the ability to do some serious damage with their specialty weapon, the bow. As melee fighters they are excellent in groups and also have some skills in lone fighting. </p></font>

<p>They are the secretive, mysterious class of the world, who sneak about in the dark. Some say they are assassins, and some that they are nothing but common thieves, but the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and they are capable of both. They are quite skilled with many weapons, but they cannot stand toe to toe with a Warrior and prefer to make the kill by a sudden attack from the rear, at which they are extremely skilled. The darker skills of picking locks and stealing are also their forte. </p>
<p>Their backstab attack is second to none and none of their melee counterparts can out damage a rogue if their target has their back towards them. A skilled rogue will also learn the arts of poisons and will inflict many forms of damage in this way. A rogue with high poisoning skills can adventure alone, however they are much more effective in groups where they can generally have more opportunities to use their backstab.</p></Font>

<p>The evil twin to the Paladin class, Shadow 
Knights derive all of their powers from the evil gods whom they 
serve. They are a meld of Warrior and Necromancer, and share some of their abilities and spells.</p>
<p>Because of their devotion to their dark deities, the Shadow Knight is given a gift once per day of harm touch. This spell does a tremendous amount of damage to one target in that time frame. Since they are evil, travel is sometimes hard for the Shadow Knight but they are always welcomed in groups as their melee skills are superb. Like all melee classes they can adventure alone, but lack some of the healing abilities of some of their counterparts which makes this a little more difficult.</p></font>

<p>Shaman are another necessary part of any group as they have some of the finest defensive spells in all of Norrath as well as some excellent damage over time spells. Coupled with their ability to cast Spirit of the Wolf, they are also very effective at lone travel especially when they reach a higher level of devotion as their gods often gift them with canine companions.</p>

With their high tolerance for pain, they are welcomed in most any group and have a limited ability to hunt alone. They are best with groups of adventurers as they are hampered by their lack of healing skills which lends to long periods of downtime waiting while their wounds heal.</p></font>

<p>Wizards are the master seekers of knowledge, and their talents and spells are focused on this goal. They use powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals.
<p>Wizards are always welcomed in group combat as the damage of their spells is rivaled by none in all of Norrath. They also have the ability to almost instantly teleport their entire party when an emergency arises. Although their main stay is with group combat, they do have limited soloing abilities using a combination of the root line of spells and their massive damage incantations.</p></font>
