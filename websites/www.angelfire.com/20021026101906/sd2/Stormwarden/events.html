<BR>If you wish to host either an event or raid, take some time and plan it out. Then do the following: (1) email in your idea with details so it can be posted on the website. (2) use the <a ref="http://pub69.ezboard.com/fstormwardenfrm1"> Messagebord</a> to let others know about your plan / idea. (3) Allow enough Real life time for members to plan accordingly - ex: we have lives to work around(jobs + school), different time zones (hi all you sweeds and auzies), and not to mention some people may take longer to arrive due to being in a far off distant zone with no immediate port.</center>

<P><U>Yidaiens' Advice to Newcomers of Crystal Caverns</U>
<BR>Crystal Caverns better known, as "CC" is a great dungeon for loot, experience, as well as raiding. Although a lot of the good loot drop spawns are random spawns meaning that they are able to spawn anywhere in the zone makes it difficult to setup camp. Although you can kind of pinpoint where about they will spawn. The Herbalist that drops the infamous Blackened Crystallined Robe (Perfect Enchanter Robe) as well as a 25% weight reduction pack, which is called the Herbalist Pack. Another random spawn would be the Inspector that drops the Cystallined Belt (Perfect for Druids, and Clerics, nice WIS stats). Most of these spawns pop around the area of the Pit.

<P>The Pit is a deep hole in the ground from the top level of CC to the very bottom. Your will need Levitate or a good Safe Fall to get to the bottom, as well as Invisibility. There is where the Foremans' spawn. They drop the Foreman Skullcap (which is good for melee classes, I have one for my Monk.) The Pit can be handled by a full group of (level range 30 to 40) players with Two Tanks, Healer/Cleric, Nuker, and Enchanter. The Enchanter is a must! This area is swarming with Orcs and you could have a bad pull that could pull the entire Pit of around 8 to 12 Orcs. Including pulls in this area would include: Orc Oracles, Watchmen, and Miners (listed in order of toughness!) Not including the Foreman. The Pit has its random spawns of the Herbalist and the Inspector, which are both 35ish (give or take a level either way!) The closest safe spot is the dwarven city, which is noted on the map. You can draw bad pulls to there and the guards will kill them. Keep in mind, the guards are not the toughest of guards and pulls will still breach the city walls, but the guards will still be attacking them also?

<P>Next Camp area (if available) is the Queen spawn. The Queen drops the Crystallined Robe (Perfect for Wizards, and Necros.) She also has other small drops, which will be down on the loot list. This spawn can be handled by a full group of (level 35 to 45) players with Two Tanks, Cleric, Nuker/Tank, Enchanter. Again the Enchanter is a must! The queen has several Crystallined Spiders ranging from Crystallined Webmasters (lvl 35ish) to spiderlings (lvl 30ish) guarding her in that same room that will agro if the Queen is pulled. Queen has a high resist to magic so the Enchanter must focus on mezzing as well as debuffing (Tashani) Magic Resist (if another Nuker is present.)

<P>Other area(s) of demolishing would be Stalag Terrors with Crystallined Hollow Terrors (levels 35 to 40ish) which have good drops listed below in the Loot listing. As well as Geonids, which are last due to the faction that some, may not want to take againest. They have bad faction againest people that may want to do the Phenocryst's Focus. So they would be a last resort, but great experience for levels 35ish?

<P>Binding is a problem; so don?t die! Hehehehe. The closest binding location to CC would be in Thurg, which everyone knows that has been to Thurg that it is a dangerous run from Thurg to CC. Including running through Great Divide with Giants, Large Dire Wolves, and Shardworms. As well as running through Eastern Waste passing the Giant Fortress and other dangerous creatures like Snow Griffens, Snow Cougars (a lot higher than the ones in IceClad), Dire Wolves, Snow Dervs, and etc.. To add to that horror running through the Orc Fortress (level 40 to 50ish) to zone into CC. So the entire point to that spiel is that a rezzing Cleric is a MUST!! Druids as well as Wizards are needed for the no caster classes to get out. The run is long and hard to get out of CC if you do not have gate or TP abilities. So to get them out those classes are a MUST!!

<P>Get a map of CC from EQATLAS.COM

<P><U>Loot</U>
<BR>Items with +INT and +CHA is better used by an Enchanter than a Wizard. As in turn a +INT and +MANA is better used by a Wizard than an Enchanter. The same thing for Melee classes. An item with AC and +STR is better used by a Warrior than a Paladin. In turn, an item with AC and +WIS is better for a Paladin than a Warrior.

<P>Once you receive a piece of rolled loot, you cannot roll again until everyone you are rolling against has won something.

<P><font size="4"><U>GUK RAID</U></font><BR>
Saturday July 21st<BR>
9pm<BR>
<P>Levels -30 will take Upper GUK
<BR>Levels 30+ will take Lower GUK
<P>we hope to camp several of the rooms there but we have to see if we cant get in as GUK is usually heavily camped, and the mobs there are dangerous.

<P><font size="4"><U>UNREST RAID</U></font><BR>

<P>How we gonna do it:<BR>
<LI>20-30 will take the lower hallways and outside
<LI>30+ will take the barkeep and second floor
<LI>Also our goal is to obtain the DW Boots from the Ghost. This will require everyone's help. Pull it outside and we Gang Mob it. Boots will be awarded by rolling /random. Its fair and heck if we are there long enough we may get 2.
<P> other drops - Jagged bands / Bloodstained Mantel

<P><font size="4"><U>Second Raid Recap- Raid on Runneye</U></Font>
<BR><font face="GoudySans">Well the raid last night in Runnyeye was a huge success. We did a lot of damage to the ranks of the Goblins who enhabite the Runnyeye zone, that im sure they will think twice about messing with us again. It took us a bit to get orgainized, there was much chaos and Frenzzied killing at first but eventualy we settled into the King Room. We Fought, drank, joked and gennerally had a good time. Little xp was gained, but we were there to outfit Ralerwen in some new cloths. His old leathers and chain were starting to smell - LOL (/em hold his nose). Ralerwen is now outfitted in a complete set of BI armor as a result of the raid. Thanks to all those who helped out. 


<P><font size="4"><U>First Raid Recap - Raid on Crushbone</U><BR></font>

<P><font face="GoudySans">
Submit your ideas for raids to Dennli or Nanarc(Derkarc).<BR>
or - post ideas for raids on the message board.

<P>The Raid in Crushbone did not go as well as I had hoped.
We were plauged by Lag, no xp and all around general chaos. None of the items we were after were obtained (SBS, BB, DWT) as a result.
Buffya and Dennli took on the Warlord in a very close battle - but alas no Battle Bracer was dropped. On the plus side, a few ppl got some xp from
fighting the lego's outside the castle entrance and Kelithe managed to replace his robe with a FBR (Flowing Black Robe).
<P>If anyone has some screen shots of the event please send them in. I have a few from the Trainer Hill and will be posting them on the 
pics section later this weekend.
<P>Lets try for a nother raid in the next few months - but lets choose a better location and aim for a specific goal. THat way we all have something to focus on.
