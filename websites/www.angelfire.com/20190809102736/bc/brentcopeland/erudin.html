<A NAME=barn>Barnacle Breastplate</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>If you talk to the guildmaster of the deepwater knights in Erudin, he will talk about some deepwater tasks, then on to a diseased shark. The Guildmaster asks for you to kill a diseased shark that is endangering the life of the ocean, fill the bag with the sharks remains, and the remains of 3 of its young. If you go to the docks, and kill the diseased shark, you will get shark items, plus some shark skin that is a lore item. The Diseased Shark is about level 10. Save the shark skin lore item, and kill the young baby sharks that spawned. Each young shark has a baby shark remains no drop lore item, which you need for the quest. Place the diseased shark skin lore item, and three of the remains (seperately in the last 3 slots of the bag), and combine. The bag becomes a no drop lore item, which you return to the guildmaster and recieve a BLUE chestplate. The chestplate is only 8ac and sv 3 heat and cold resistances. However, it looks very spiffy, and is great for parties, gatherings, and weddings =) It's a darker blue than crafted armor too.  (Submmitted by InterSlayer)

He will ask if you want to "face fear"  and when you say yes, he will tell you to go to Kerra Island and kill a Cat Fisher, and bring back his tail for a little money, experience, faction and an item (usually a brass ring). This quest will not be given after level 12.   (Submitted by Izzar)

<A NAME=clear>Clear Water:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1> If you are a paladin, you can get Clear Water and/or a guild coin by talking to the Bank manager and asking him for vasty deep water.  He says your guild must have sent you to get it and asks you to bring him a guild coin and he will give you the water.  Go back to the temple and ask for a guild coin ,which will be given with the message remember this is not currency.  The coin is a lore item that gives +10 mana.  Give this to the banker and he will give you the water and some experience and some faction., I'm not sure what you do with the water, so you may just want to keep the coin for the mana boost.

<A NAME=convert>Convert a Fisherman:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>A guild trainer upstairs from the Deepwater Knights guild in Erudin will ask you to convert a fisherman in Qeynos.  She tells you that the fisherman will break his pole and give it to you to return back to her for fulfilling the quest.   This fisherman is located in the pond of N. Qeynos.  Dive into the pond and go into the sewers.  In the sewers, there is a fisherman near the "main open area" of the aquaducts (he is not there all the time).  Talk to him and he will tell you that he is willing to go back to worshipping the God of Prexus if you will give him your guild tunic (I assume you must still have your guild tunic to fulfill this quest).  Give him the tunic and he will give you his broken fishing pole.  Then take the broken pole back to the guild trainer and she will give you experience, faction standing and an item, possibly an orange ring (Submitted by Buju) </font></b>

Lius will tell you that the heretic escaped.  the heritics are the various Necromancers wandering around Tox Forest.  If you bring the remains of any heretic to Markus he will reward you.  Kill one of them and return his remains for experience, faction and a reward.  Your faction raises with High Counsel of Erudin and High Guard of Erudin, and lowers with Heritics.  I don't know if the reward is greater if you kill Talliger, who is the most powerful heretic.  (Submitted by Aoiryuu and Fellus)

Return to the Wizard's Guild in Erudin and take the bag to Josper Kenshed.  He will say, " Well done my young apprentice. I call you apprentice, fore you are nothing but a spark to my fire. This is the final component for my greatest creation... AHA!! I call it.. Iced Tea!! Never again shall I boil under the hot sun. As for you, take this. It should serve you well. Now go away.

<A NAME=scroll>Ilanic's Scroll:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>Josper Kenshed in the wizards guild also mentions a [special matter].  Ask him about it and he will ask  you to find the skeleton Ilanic and ask him [where is the scroll?].  Apparently, he sent his apprentice Ilanic to test his new spell icecapades, which others call column of frost, but only gave him half the spell and it backfired and he has been lookin for Ilanic for awhile now.  He says Ilanic wanders Tox forest.  He says when you bring the scroll  half back to him he'll give the complete spell.  I'm not sure where you find Ilanic, but the half scroll can be found on a Kobald caster in Tox forest, which is a pretty rare spawn.  For completing the quest you will get: The spell Column of frost, exp, good faction with The Crimson hands, The high council and the High guard of Erudin, and Bad faction with the Heretics.

<A NAME=inert>Inert Potion:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>On the third floor of the castle, Toresian Fhabel is waiting for someone to take an inert potion down to Vials of Vitality, on the first floor of the castle.  There are two people who you can give the potion to.  The first time you run the quest, the correct person (with a single name, not a surname) 'spawns' in the shop and if you hand the bottle to him, the factions are gained with craftkeepers/council/guards of Erudin and lost with the Heretics. If you run this quest a second time immediately following the first, then "A Gate Bandit" will spawn in place of the person you are supposed to give the bottle to.  If you hand the bottle to the bandit, then your factions with Corrupt Qeynos Guards, Heretics, and others will go up and good factions will go down. This bandit is about L10 or 11, and it is possible that killing him starts a new quest by talking to one of the NPC's in the shop.

<A NAME=book>Library Book:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>If you go talk to Rarnan Lapice on the top floor of the temple of divine light in Erudin, he will tell you to fetch a book from the library. This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest.   The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last checked it out.  When you ask him, he tells you that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.  He tells you to go talk to his sister who is in the Erudin Palace.  Once there, she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.  When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive.  Her brother is at Crows  (It seems he is sick and is in need of some Erud's Tonic.  This is a side quest).  Ask him about The Testament of Vanear.  He says yes he has it and will sell it to me for 2 gold.  If you give him the 2 gold he gives you the book which has to inventory slots and a combine button in it.   He then laughs and tells you that a thief stole pages 30 and 34 and the book is worthless without them.  He also says that the thief sold the pages to someone named Ran.  If you then ask him who Ran is he tells you that Ran Flamespinner is a librarian in Highpass.  If you go to Highpass and ask about The Testament of Vanear he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in Highpass, because he could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a hidden camp of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dynil Fireshine. Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport).  Beware that any smugglers around him will come to his aid.  Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard, +Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers)After going back to Qeynos, I went back to Moodoro and said I want page 34.   He said ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty smart of me to rip out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I get it because the work is fiction anyway.  He then offers to play a game with you for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card is a jester he will give you the page.  Along with the jester, you might also draw the King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight.   [Note - keep the Knights and give them to the dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward].  Once the whole thing is combined you get the Testament of Vanear, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is a no drop lore item, but presently can't be used  (rumor is this will change in a future patch).  Return the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum.  Of course, if they ever activate the testament it will be worth far more on the open market.

<A NAME=staff>Peacekeeper Staff:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>Speak to Lumi Stergnon in the clerics guild and offer to retrieve the peackeeper staff.  He will hand you a letter which you should take to Emil Parsini, a merchant in the first hut outside of Erudin in the Tox Forest.  He will give you a staff to fill with treant resin and an odus pearl.  In the harbor there is a place where you can at times find 2 Odus Pearls under 2 Sand Sharks fairly close togethor (on a side note sometimes there will be NPC's seen swimming here who I believe also collect the pearls, if you kill one of these NPC's they say the Circle of Unseen Hands will get revenge your faction with the Qeynos Guards goes up faction with corrupt guards and the circle of the unseen hands go down I also think faction with Qeynos merchants went down)...  You want to get both of these because in order to get the treant chips you need to talk to a man in the upstairs of the cobbler shop in North Qeynos... he says he will give you some treant chips if you do a favor for him... the favor is to get him an Odus Pearl give him a pearl and he will give you the treant chips you need to get the treant resin made.Once you combine an odus pearl (from the harbor) with the resin, you get a peacekeeper staff (Damage 4/Speed 30--weapon for clerics and paladins).  If you return the staff to the cleric, he will give you faction, xp, a random item and an additional quest, or  you can keep the staff.  This quest will not be given after level 12.

<A NAME=heads>Poacher Heads:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>Those nasty poachers wandering around Toxxulia haven't just annoyed you.  They've apparantly pissed off one of the townspeople who stands just outside the Temple of Quellios.  His request is a little gruesome, but hey it's a barbaric world out there.  Bring him head of a poacher and he will reward you with a little money, experience and faction. The faction adjustments are as follows:  KaranaBandits get worse;  KaranaResidents, GuardsofQeynos, HighpassGuards and CircleofUnseenHands get better.  Also, after bring back several heads and bone boxes, the npc ask you to find out who rules the poaches.  You are told that you must find a clue on the body of a poacher, and the one who summons the skeletons and bring back their head.  I don't know the outcome of this part of the quest.

<A NAME=vasty>Vasty Deep Water:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>If you go talk to one of the Paladins on the top floor of the temple of divine light, he will tell you to fetch a book from the library.  This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest. The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows the person who last checked it out.  When you ask him, he tells you that the person who checked out the book is names Modorro and that he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.  He tells you to go talk to his sister who is in the Erudin Palace.  Once there, she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.  When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive.  She'll then tell you how Moodoro got corrupted by a halfling named Flynn Merrington. They used to sell the valuable Vasty Deep Water, till Moodoro got caught.  Here's where there is a catch, part of getting to the quest requires asking a question that is not in brackets. Some people may miss it that way. Nolusia says that she created a doppleganger to die in Moodoro's place.  You must ask Nolusia 'What is a doppleganger' or 'What about the doppleganger?' Even though it is not in brackets. She'll tell you it died in Moodoro's place and he relocated to Qeynos, and that she is afraid that he's started up again because of Flynn.  Lanken Rjarn knows, and they're both afraid that the High Council will learn of it. So she wants to murder Flynn Merrington.  She wants you to return a bottle of Vasty deep water to her, so that she can poision it to give it to Flynn.   If you say yes, she tells you to find out how they get their Vasty Deep Waters and to bring a bottle to her and she will poison the lip you are then to take it to Flynn not Moodoro and that will end everything.  You can get Vasty Deep Waters by talking to the Bank manager and asking him for it  (it may be that only an enchanter can use it for this quest though). He says your guild must have sent you to get it.  Bring me a guild coin and I will give you the water.  Go back to the temple and ask for a guild coin which will be given with the message remember this is not currency.  The coin is a lore item that gives +10 mana.  Give this to the banker and he will give you the water and some experience and some faction.  Then go back and gave the water to the sister.  (Submitted by Aadon and Himmaggery) </font></b><CENTER>

<A NAME=flesh>Zombie Flesh:</A>:<BR></font><font color=blue font size=+1>A guild trainer upstairs from the Deepwater Knights guild in Erudin will ask you to fill a bag with zombie flesh. She gives you a large bag in which you can put the zombie flesh and tells you that the zombie flesh can be found near erud's crossing.  Kill zombie sailors on the island to harvest their flesh.  This takes a pretty high level to survive.  If you want, you can buy 4 zombie skins from the cat merchant, but you won't get your money back that way.  Combine the bag and return it to the trainer for experience, faction and a minor item.  (Submitted by Buju)
