<FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=5 color=808000><img SRC="neriak1.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br>I Awoke in Neriak to find images of the Priest of Discord plastered over every building<br>
and hiding in EVERY shadow!<br><br><br><img SRC="neriak2.gif"><br>His face was everywhere! Discord was the dictator here. I, new prey.<br> Unscupted by the doctrine. I felt him watching me with evil glee and I thought,<br> "Why not? I should join him. I would be safe at last."<br><br>
<br><br><Br> <img SRC="neriak3.gif"><br> No!!! I Mustn't! But the pull....His face! Everywhere! A subtile deception dancing in his eyes....<br><br><br><br><center><img SRC="neriak4.gif"><br>As I pondered his expression I found my hand resting comfortingly upon <br>that old dusty book stored away in my pack. It was then that I recognized the nature of that powerful stare. <br>I decided it would be best if I moved on.  fast....<br><br><br><br><IMG SRC="lava1.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br><FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=5 COLOR=808000>I fled Neriak and that face to the closest zone i could find... Lavastorm....<br><br><br><br><br><IMG SRC="lava2.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br>I did not find refuge amongst the Lava Crawlers...<br> In fact, My dilemma became worse when I spied the dark face in the clouds!<br> Was Innoruk more then just a myth to scared Children?<br> Had I seen his face????<br><br><br><br><IMG SRC="grobb1.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br>I sought out Grobb and the company of Trolls after that. <br><br><br><br><br><IMG SRC="grobb2.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br> But Grobb too tried to make me ill with seasickness.<br> I closed my eyes and ran for the swamps...

H R Geiger would have felt comfortable too...<br><Br><br><br><br><IMG SRC="grobb5.gif" WIDTH="640" HEIGHT="480" BORDER=0><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=6 COLOR=turquoise>And thus my night of madness ended - or at least I do not remember what happened after that. When I awoke later my world was as it had always been. All I have as evidence of my experience is this story and my pictures. Many refuse to believe my tale as it is too disturbing to their reality. If you are this way then I understand. But talk to any enchantress and they will tell you, reality has many faces...<br><br><br>
