<FONT FACE="Calligraph421 BT" SIZE=4><B><center><FONT Size="6">In the constant search to relieve lag during gameplay, I opted to download and install the latest graphic driver for my graphics card. It was an easy and familiar procedure. I rebooted after installation and logged onto Everquest to enjoy then newest little graphical details my new driver brought me. Boy was I SHOCKED! Thus I embarked on my everquest Psycho-nightmare!<br>
<br><br> The following screenshots are all that survived of a night of deep confusion and paranoia. I was much relieved the following morning when I reviewed these pictures, that they truely had occured. And in some ways now that I revertyed to my previous driver, I miss the chaos of that night! Would you agree? I leave it to your judgement and enjoyment:)<br><br><br><font color=silver font size=5>UPDATED 2/26/00 ~ Friday night marked another Very Odd Experience in Norrath. Somewhat of an "Adult" nature- <br>whatever THAT means...<br>I posted a few screenshots (the more Riske~ ones I will post when I have a bit of time...<br>They are all pretty funny regardless:) and all in all it was a Hilarious episode:)<br><br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/l-travis/Weird2.html">After Hours inside the Third Gate</a><br><br>Also it has come to my attention that there are some problems with the download page. I double and triple checked it and keep coming back to the conclusion that it has to do with the geocities network :( I am in the process of moving the download page at least temporarily to another site. Please bare with me :)<br><br> Oh and I received this message from the Guestbook company:  <br>"This past Saturday and Sunday we had a problem with the database server 
that
holds your guestbook (it ran out of disk space), which is why you 
couldn't  sign
it. There's plenty of space now so you shouldn't have any more problems." <br>So now the original Guessbook is working again supposedly so you have your choice of books to sign:)<br>
<br> Thanks again and May You Have Far-reaching Eyes Thru Norrathian Fog......<br>
<br><br>UPDATED ~ 2/21/00 ~ Many of you have asked for a way to download the music that I used here. I have created a link to a download page for this purpose. Hope you enjoy it! The Driver download is not working yet and with the discovery that if you turn off your Mip Mapping as a temporary solution you can play the game, I am reconsidering whether or not to post the driver after all (it is so big!) Anyways, thanks again and Safe Travels to you all~over the web or in the land of Norrath....


<br><br>UPDATED 2/20/00~Guestbook is having an error so I added an alternative one. <br>It is working now. Thanks for all the email and Encouragements:)<br><br>UPDATED WITH NEW PICTURES AND MORE STORY IN NERIAK ~ Saturday 2/19/00<br><br><font color=lightslategrey>Also, many of you have requested how to fix this problem.<br> Some have also posted possible solutions. I solved it that night by re-installing<br> the driver I had been using previously to the weird one.<br> I am working on posting that driver and the Music files, since that was also requested:)<br><br><font color=silver>Thank you all so much for your encouragement and enjoyment! :)</font><br><br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ut/Kila/GreaterFaydark.html">Greater Faydark</a><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ut/Kila/Qeynos.html">        Qeynos</a><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ut/Kila/Dark.html">Neriak, Lavastorm and Grobb</a><br>
