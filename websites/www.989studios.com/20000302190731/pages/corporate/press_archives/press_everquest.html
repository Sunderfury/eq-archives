Each of these continents has diverse species, economic systems, alliances and politics.<br>						<br>						&quot;<i>EverQuest</i> is way ahead of its time, both technologically and conceptually,&quot; added Flock. &quot;Its continual popularity can be attributed to its uniqueness and addictive gameplay, which differs from any other form of personal entertainment, be it books, movies or even videogames. Simply, by transporting the gameplayer into another world, with tens of thousands of people playing online simultaneously, <i>EverQuest</i> offers gamers an unparalleled immersive social experience.&quot;<br>						<br>						989 Studios &#150; <i>EverQuest Breaks Industry Records</i><br>						<br>						During peak periods, <i>EverQuest</i> adventurers and dragon slayers can form alliances with up to 37,000 other players simultaneously.
