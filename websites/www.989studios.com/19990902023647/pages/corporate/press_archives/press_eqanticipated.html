Heralded by game reviewers as						an extraordinary evolution in online role-playing games, EverQuest						features a multitude of adventures and quests that break the mold						in the online role-playing game genre. <br>						<br>						&quot;We have already received phenomenal feedback on the pre-launch						of EverQuest from all of our retailers and are obviously very						pleased by the high volume of pre-sell orders,&quot; said Jeffrey Fox,						vice president, marketing, 989 Studios. &quot;EverQuest is literally						the most detailed and visually stunning role-playing game ever						developed and since we are limiting the initial build of this						game to ensure no server issues, consumers should take advantage						of the pre-sell opportunities to make sure they can secure a copy						of EverQuest before the retail launch on March 16.&quot; <br>						<br>						The retail pre-sell promotions that began February 1 allows consumers						to either pre-purchase or put a deposit on their copy of EverQuest						at select retail outlets across the nation. To date, more than						8,000 consumers have reserved a copy of the game. With one week						remaining before EverQuest&#146;s retail launch, 989 Studios is estimating						that the pre-sell list will exceed 10,000 units. After consumers						have purchased EverQuest at retail, there will be a fee of $9.89						per month for access to the ever-changing world of EverQuest.						<br>						EverQuest allows thousands of gamers from all over the world to						adventure solo, at great peril, or join forces with online allies						to fight off enemies together. The Station@sony.com will be the						official provider of EverQuest software updates and news about						the game, message boards and other community features, as well						as an easy-to-use billing system for EverQuest&#146;s monthly subscription						fee.<br>						<br>						989 Studios, a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, is a						wholly-owned division of Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.						and is the third-largest PlayStation&reg; software publisher in North						America. Headquartered in Foster City, California, with additional						development studios in San Diego and Santa Monica, 989 Studios						develops software for the PlayStation game console, personal computer						and online markets. 989 Studios is a recognized leader in the						videogame industry, with top franchise titles such as NFL GameDay&#153;,						Twisted Metal&reg;, Jet Moto&#153; and Cool Boarders&reg;<br>						</font></div>				</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td colspan="2" align="center">&nbsp; <a href="../../../index_studios.html" target="_top"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">					<hr>					989 Studios</font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> | <a href="../../../index_sports.html" target="_top">989 Sports</a> | <a href="../../playstation/index.html" target="_top">PlayStation Games</a> | <a href="../../pc/index.html" target="_top">PC Games</a> | <a href="../../promotions/index.html" target="_top">Promotions</a> | <a href="../corp.html" target="_top">Corporate</a> | <a href="../../../cgi-bin/search/index.html" target="_top">Search<br>					</a></font></td>			</tr>		</table>	</body></html>
