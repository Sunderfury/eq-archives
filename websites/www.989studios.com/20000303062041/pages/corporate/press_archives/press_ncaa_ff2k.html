This new technology generates graphics more than twice as detailed as those in last year&#146;s <i>NCAA&reg; Final Four&reg; &#146;99</i>, and delivers the most realistic player model in both appearance and movement. To further increase the realism of the game, motion capture animation was used to incorporate the movements of college basketball stars; most notably former Duke All-American Trajan Langdon, former Kansas All-American Paul Pierce and former California Berkeley All-American Jason Kidd.<br>						<br>						&quot;Last year&#146;s <i>NCAA Final Four &#146;99</i> was a big hit for college hoops fans because of the authentic gameplay and extensive number of schools included in the game,&quot; said Jeffrey Fox, vice president, marketing, 989 Studios. &quot;NCAA Final Four 2000 goes to the next level with superior graphics, awesome new features and even more exciting college action. Quite simply, this game is incredibly fun to play.&quot;<br>						<br>						989 Sports &#150;<i> NCAA Final Four 2000</i><br>						<br>						New college-specific playbooks were designed with the assistance of Jim Harrick, University of Georgia head basketball coach. Each team in <i>NCAA Final Four 2000</i> runs its offense and defense similar to each college&#146;s style of play. Players can also select their favorite team and compete for a conference championship and an automatic berth in the NCAA 64-team tournament. (Teams not fortunate enough to win their conference can keep an eye on the new &quot;Bubble Watch&quot; feature to see if they will be going to the Tournament).<br>						<br>						In addition to these new features, <i>NCAA Final Four 2000</i> is loaded with all the options and atmosphere college basketball fans come to expect. ESPN&#146;s Quinn Buckner returns to the announcing booth with brand new commentary. The &quot;6th Man Meter&quot; is back with more power to fire up the home crowd. New animations provide the gamer with every possible scenario, including coaches barking orders from the sidelines, players congratulating each other and the ability to pass after starting to shoot.<br>						<br>						<i>NCAA Final Four 2000</i> features former Duke All-American Trajan Langdon on the package.<br>						<br>						<b>NCAA Final Four 2000 Key Features:</b></font></p>						<ul>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">More than 300 Division I-A teams from 31 different conferences<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">All-new 3D player models scaled to actual height and weight<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Play-by-play commentary by college basketball announcer Quinn Buckner<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New animations include players congratulating each other, coaches yelling orders from the sidelines, the ability to pass after starting to shoot, put-back slam dunks and the ability to run the baseline when inbounding the ball (when legal)<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New college-specific playbooks designed with help from Georgia head basketball coach Jim Harrick<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New &quot;Bubble Watch&quot; feature gives the gamer updates on how well his team is doing during a season<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Real college atmosphere with animated crowds, cheerleaders, chants and fight songs<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Icon Passing&#153;, Icon Cutting&#153; and Icon Switching&#153; returns to give the gamer ultimate control of his players on both offense and defense<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Individual and team stats in 32 different categories<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Awards -- First and second team All-Americans, National Player of the Year, Conference Player of the Year<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Four gameplay settings -- Freshman through Senior<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The &quot;Shot Meter&quot; is back to give the gamer complete control over player shooting abilities<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The &quot;6th Man Meter&quot; returns to fire up the home crowd and help the home team make shots<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Motion capture animation by former college standouts (and current NBA pros) Cleveland Cavaliers&#146; Brevin Knight and Trajan Langdon, Boston Celtics&#146; Paul Pierce, Orlando Magic&#146;s Charles &quot;Bo&quot; Outlaw, Los Angeles Lakers&#146; Robert Horry and Phoenix Suns&#146; Jason Kidd<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Four game modes: Tournament, Exhibition, Season and Arcade</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Up to eight players can play with Multi-tap adapter<br>							</font>						</ul>						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">989 Sports &#150; <i>NCAA Final Four 2000</i><br>						<br>						<br>						989 Sports is the sports software brand of 989 Studios.
