This year, <i>NHL FaceOff 2000</i> has built on the success of the <i>NHL FaceOff &#153;</i> franchise to include more than 150 new player animations. Every subtle and personalized move is perfected to amazing detail.<br>					<br>					New I.C.E. AI&#153; (Intelligence Comprehension Execution Artificial Intelligence) has players playing and reacting just as they do in the NHL. Icon Passing&#153; and Icon Switching&#153; bring incredible realism and control to players as they battle for the puck in offensive and defensive zones. The new &quot;Puck Halo&quot; will make the puck easier to see and play with in the corners and in front of the goal. Players can sprint across the blue line on a breakaway, glide in and unleash a slap shot that hits the post or goes too high and shatters the glass.<br>					<br>					With the use of actual blueprints, arenas are re-created in amazing detail. The new 3D player models capture every nuance with real texture-mapped faces that are true to the facial features of NHL stars. Increased camera angles, pop-up stats and in-game panels work in cadence with the authentic audio of play-by-play announcer Mike Emrick and color commentator Darren Pang, creating the best TV&#150;style presentation available for a hockey videogame.<br>					<br>					<i>NHL FaceOff 2000</i> incorporates all 28 NHL teams for the 1999&#150;2000 season (including the Atlanta Thrashers&#153;) with updated rosters and the ability to play through an entire season. Gamers can track more than 30 individual and team stats and compete for any of 15 NHL awards, including the Hart Memorial, Art Ross, Vezina, Conn Smythe, Presidents and the Stanley Cup&reg;.<br>					<br>					<i><b>NHL FaceOff 2000</b></i><b> Key Features:</b></font></p>					<ul>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Unrivaled 3D game engine </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Realistic 3D player models based on player size, weight and facial appearance </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">NHL arenas derived from the actual blueprints and presented in lifelike detail - each arena&#146;s characteristics are included, even the championship banners and Jumbotrons&#153;</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Interactive crowds with team chants, yells and special animations such as hats being thrown onto the ice after a hat trick</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Eye-popping TV-style presentation featuring two-man commentary, including New Jersey Devils&#146; acclaimed announcer Mike Emrick and ESPN&#146;s analyst Darren Pang</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Seven different game-play camera angle option settings and countless cut-aways, zoom-ins, pop-up stats and in-game panels</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New &quot;Puck Halo&quot; makes the puck easier to see and play with in the corners and in front of the net</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New I.C.E.
