Already a videogame hit in Japan, Bust A Groove is now					bringing pure dancing fun to the rest of the videogame world.&quot;With					its overwhelming popularity, the rhythm and music game category					has defined an incredible new growth area for the PlayStation,					as well as a whole new group of PlayStation game enthusiasts,&quot;					said Jeffrey Fox, vice president, marketing, 989 Studios. &quot;Last					year&#146;s introduction of this genre set a new precedent in the industry					and pushed the levels of creative and original product development					to new highs. The Bust A Groove videogame is another step in this					direction.&quot;<br>					<br>					Developed by Enix Corporation, a game software developer based					in Tokyo, Japan, Bust A Groove combines state-of-the-art technology					with the best dancing action ever developed for a next-generation					game system. In order to create the most realistic gameplay, dance					moves were choreographed by professional dancers and incorporated					into the game. Bust A Groove is the first dance videogame to use					motion capture technology. Typically used for fighting or sports					games, motion capture in music games creates a whole new level					of gaming realism.<br>					<br>					In Bust A Groove, players compete against one another in an all-out					dance-off to determine who has the best dance moves. Players must					rhythmically push buttons in sync with the beat of the game&#146;s					music, performing a variety of dance styles, such as, hip-hop,					jazz, disco and more. <br>					<br>					Also featured in the game is a One or Two-Player Mode; Practice					Mode, which allows players to freely test their dancing and rhythm					skills; and Dance Edit, where the player pre-sets dance moves.					In addition, players can also choose from 10 very unique dancers.					Bust A Groove&#146;s special musical talent was contributed by Hatsumi					Morinaga, a popular singer in Japan whose debut single just released					and was named Japan&#146;s biggest dance label.<br>					<br>					<b>Bust A Groove Key Features</b></font></p>					<ul>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">One or two players </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">10 different 3D polygon characters to choose from, each with their						own unique dance styles, combos and attacks </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Four hidden characters </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">One-Player Mode (player vs. computer) </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Two-Player Mode (player vs. player) </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Practice Mode (player freely inputs commands in sync with game						music) </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Dance Edit (player pre-sets the dance moves in advance) </font>					</ul>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">989 Studios, a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, is a					wholly-owned division of Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.					and is the third-largest PlayStation&reg; software publisher in North					America.
