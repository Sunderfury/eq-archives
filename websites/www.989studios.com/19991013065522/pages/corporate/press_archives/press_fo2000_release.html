This year, <i>NHL FaceOff 2000</i> has built on the success of the <i>NHL FaceOff &#153;</i> franchise to include motion capture animations from Chicago Blackhawks&reg; winger Tony Amonte and Phoenix Coyotes&reg; goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin &#150; totaling more than 150 new player animations.  Every subtle and personalized move is perfected to amazing detail.<br>					<br>					New I.C.E. AI&#153; (Intelligence Comprehension Execution Artificial Intelligence), developed with eight-time Stanley Cup&reg; champion and Red Wings&reg; head coach Scotty Bowman, has players playing and reacting just as they do in the NHL&reg;.  Icon Passing&#153; and Icon Switching&#153; bring incredible realism and control to players as they battle for the puck in offensive and defensive zones.  The new &quot;Puck Halo&quot; will make the puck easier to see, and play within the corners and in front of the goal.  Players can sprint across the blue line on a breakaway, and glide in and unleash a slap shot that hits the post or goes too high and hits the boards. <br>					<br>					With the use of actual blueprints, arenas are re-created in amazing detail.  The new 3D player models capture every nuance with real texture-mapped faces, which are true to the facial features of NHL stars.  Increased camera angles, pop-up stats and in-game panels work in cadence with the authentic audio of play-by-play announcer Mike Emrick and color commentator Darren Pang, creating the best TV&#150;style presentation available for a hockey videogame.<br>					<br>					<i>NHL FaceOff 2000</i> incorporates all 28 NHL teams for the 1999&#150;2000 season (including the Atlanta Thrashers&#153;) with updated rosters and the ability to play through an entire season.
