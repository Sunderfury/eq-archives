Tanarus is a futuristic, multiplayer, online					tank combat game that pits up to 10,000 opponents against each					other on a virtual battlefield. Tanarus is located at The Station					(www.station.sony.com or www.tanarus.com). The subscription is					priced online at $9.95 a month. </font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">&quot;Tanarus puts action gamers on notice that The Station is there					for them. We are thrilled that our premier action game comes from					the creative team that has made PlayStationTM games the market					leaders,&quot; said Mark Benerofe, Vice President of Programming and					Platform Development for Sony Online Ventures Inc. &quot;With more					action, strategy and role playing games coming in '98, and with					our current game show hits like Jeopardy! Online, Wheel of Fortune					Online and Out of Order, The Station is the destination for games					on the Web.&quot; </font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">&quot;SISA's expertise is in game development with a proven track record					developing popular games for the PlayStationTM game console. Now,					with Tanarus, for the first time, we are bringing the excitement					of an action game online to the Web audience,&quot; said John Smedley,					Director of PC Development and creator of Tanarus at SISA. </font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Tanarus allows players around the world to develop strategies					that permit &quot;real&quot; tank commanders to set up defensive positions					and organize offensive strikes without using artificial intelligence.					In the beta test alone, Tanarus has been extremely well received,					attracting more than 100,000 enthusiastic players. Fighting in					an ever-changing, dynamic battleground ranging from post-apocalyptic					cities to industrial wastelands, players can choose from five					futuristic tanks and over 30 different weapons and modules. In					addition, Tanarus game play is enhanced through a simultaneous					chat feature on The Station. The minimum hardware recommendation					for Tanarus is a PC with Windows 95 and Pentium 120 with 16 megabytes					of RAM. </font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A CD-ROM version of Tanarus, to be used in conjunction with online					play at The Station, is priced at $19.95. It is now available					at retail outlets, and will be available for purchase online at					The Station Store. The CD-ROM adds three bonus features to enhance					online play: a city editor, which offers players the ability to					create and submit original cityscapes; a single player training					mode; and CD quality music by multimedia musician The FatMan.					Retail consumers will also receive one free month of online game					play with purchase of the CD-ROM. </font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Sony Interactive Studios America develops entertainment software					for the PlayStation game console, personal computer, and online					markets.
