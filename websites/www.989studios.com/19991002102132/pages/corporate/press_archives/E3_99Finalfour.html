This new technology will generate graphics more than twice as detailed as those in <i>NCAA&reg; Final Four&reg; &#146;99</i>, and delivers the most realistic player model in both appearance and movement. <i>NCAA Final Four 2000</i> players are scaled to their actual height and weight and designed to play to their actual abilities. To further increase the realism of the game, motion capture animation was used to incorporate the movements of college basketball stars, most notably former Kansas All-American Paul Pierce.<br>					<br>					<i>&quot;NCAA Final Four &#146;99</i> was a big hit for college hoops fans because of the authentic gameplay and extensive amount of schools we included in the game,&quot; said Jeffrey Fox, vice president, marketing, 989 Studios. &quot;<i>NCAA Final Four 2000</i> goes to the next level with superior graphics, awesome new features and even more exciting college action. <i>NCAA Final Four 2000&#146;s</i> development team has truly captured the intensity and emotion of college basketball like never before.&quot;<br>					<br>					The new &quot;Create A Player&quot; feature allows gamers to put themselves in the lineup or try to fill a hole by adding, say, a 6&#146;10&quot; power forward. Players can select their favorite team and compete for a conference championship and an automatic berth in the NCAA 64-team tournament. (Teams not fortunate enough to win their conference can keep an eye on the new &quot;Bubble Watch&quot; feature to see if they will be heading for the tournament).<br>					<br>					In addition to these new features, <i>NCAA Final Four 2000</i> is loaded with all the options and atmosphere college basketball fans come to expect. Each team runs its offense and defense similar to the way it does in real life. ESPN&#146;s Quinn Buckner returns to the announcing booth with brand new commentary. The &quot;6th Man Meter&quot; is back with more power to fire up the home crowd. New animations will provide the gamer with every possible scenario, including coaches barking orders from the sidelines, players taunting each other and the ability to pass after starting to shoot.<br>					<br>					<i><b>NCAA Final Four</b></i><b> Key Features:</b></font></p>					<ul>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">More than 300 Division I teams </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">All-new 3D player models scaled to actual height and weight</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Play-by-play done by college basketball announcer Quinn Buckner</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New &quot;Create A Player&quot; feature lets the gamer put himself into the game or fill a hole in his lineup </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New animations include players taunting and congratulating each other, coaches yelling orders from the sideline, the ability to pass after starting to shoot, put-back slam dunks and the ability to run the baseline when inbounding the ball (when legal)</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">New &quot;Bubble Watch&quot; feature gives the gamer updates on how well his team is doing during a season</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Icon Passing&#153;, Icon Cutting&#153; and Icon Switching&#153; returns to give the gamer ultimate control of his players on both offense and defense</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Real college atmosphere with animated crowds, chants and fight songs</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">3 game modes: Tournament, Exhibition and Season</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Individual and team stats in 32 different categories</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Awards -- 1st and 2nd team All-Americans, National Player of the Year, Conference Player of the Year</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Four gameplay settings -- Freshman through Senior</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The &quot;Shot Meter&quot; is back to give the gamer complete control over his players&#146; shooting abilities</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Motion capture animation by several former college standouts (and current NBA pros) Brevin Knight from the Cleveland Cavaliers, Charles &quot;Bo&quot; Outlaw from the Orlando Magic, Paul Pierce from the Boston Celtics and Robert Horry from the Los Angeles Lakers</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Up to eight players can play with Multi-tap adapter</font>					</ul>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">989 Sports is the sports software brand of 989 Studios.
