Players can choose to begin the game in any of the						three continents, with more than 70 adventure zones and 12 cities.						Each of these continents comes with its own diverse species, economic						systems, alliances and politics. Throughout this adventure, players						form groups, strategic alliances and gather magical artifacts						in their perilous and exciting quest to conquer the world of Norrath.<br>						<br>						On their journey, players have the opportunity to earn experience						points, discover hidden treasures and acquire new skills. Over						60 unique skills and innate abilities per character allows the						player to become the noblest of knights or the most vicious elf.						For those who enjoy magic, there are more than 800 spells in five						distinct magic classes to protect them as they explore the rich						and vast world of dungeons, towers, crypts and evil abbeys throughout						the game&#146;s many dimensions.<br>						<br>						Adventurers can explore the world of Norrath alone, but are encouraged						to form alliances to acquire knowledge, solve puzzles and travel						to strange, sometimes dangerous lands. Players can also interact						with characters controlled by other gamers -- some good, some						bad -- as well as computer controlled non-player characters.<br>						<br>						Unlike other Internet role playing games, EverQuest allows players						to view the 3D environment from a number of different camera angles,						and is optimized to support the latest 3D graphic accelerator						technology from 3Dfx Interactive&#145; and Microsoft&#147; Direct 3D. <br>						The Station@sony.com will be the official provider of EverQuest						software updates and news about the game, message boards and other						community features, as well as an easy-to-use billing system for						EverQuest&#146;s monthly subscription fee.<br>						<br>						<b>EverQuest Key Features</b></font></p>						<ul>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Supports more than 1,500 players simultaneously per server </font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Immerse yourself in beautiful picturesque 3D environments</font> 							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Provides SVGA (640x480) 16-bit color scenery of dungeons, arctic							tundra, vast deserts and even a completely underwater environment							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Player killing (Pkilling) is available to those who wish to participate							in this mode, while those who do not wish to participate in Pkilling							are immune </font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Choose from 12 races and 14 classes, including dwarves, ogres,							trolls, rangers, wizards and rogues</font> 							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">More than 60 unique skills and innate abilities per character</font> 							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Collect thousands of magical items, including artifacts of great							power</font> 							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Learn hundreds of spells in five separate magic using classes</font> 							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Optimized for the latest 3D graphic accelerator technology, EverQuest							supports Voodoo Graphics&#145; by 3Dfx Interactive&#145; and Microsoft&reg;							Direct3D&#145;</font> 						</ul>						<p>&nbsp;</p>						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>EverQuest System Requirements</b></font></p>						<ul>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Operating System: Windows&reg; 95</font> 							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">CPU: Intel Pentium&reg; 166 required.
