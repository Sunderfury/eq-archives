Licensed by the NFL and PLAYERS INC, NFL <i>GameDay 2000</i> features all 31 NFL teams, more than 1,500 players, 1,240 new plays created by real NFL players, all-new 3D graphics, a revolutionary Telestrator, announcers Dick Enberg and Phil Simms, and 200 new motion capture moves from 13 NFL players.<br>					<br>					&quot;Consistently, the <i>NFL GameDay&#145;</i> series is the football videogame choice for NFL players because of its realistic gameplay and unbelievable graphics,&quot; said Jeffrey Fox, vice president, marketing, 989 Studios. &quot;This year, we have taken <i>NFL GameDay 2000</i> to the next level by incorporating extensive input from nearly 45 NFL players, including more than 1,200 plays drawn by NFL players. Plus, now there is a Training Camp Mode to practice plays, and a GM mode to manage your team over multiple seasons.&quot;<br>					<br>					<i>NFL GameDay 2000</i> features the most realistic 3D players ever to grace the PlayStation, each one scaled to actual size, weight and body style. All-new stadiums are detailed to perfection, including field wear and tear, and animated backgrounds. An updated TV-style presentation incorporates dramatic camera angles as well as new commentary by world-renowned sportscasters Dick Enberg and Phil Simms. Plus, for the first time ever in a sports videogame, gamers can enjoy auto instant replay with the aid of an on-screen Telestrator.<br>					<br>					<i>NFL GameDay 2000</i> reflects the trends and schemes of the NFL with actual NFL player input -- from motion capture animations to plays designed by real NFL players. Players motion captured for <i>NFL GameDay 2000</i> include a virtual who&#146;s-who of All-Pros, including Bengals QB Akili Smith, Jaguars WR Jimmy Smith, Vikings DT John Randle, Raiders WR Tim Brown and CB Charles Woodson, New York Giants CB Jason Sehorn, and Buccaneers FB Mike Alstott and LB Hardy Nickerson. Authentic playbooks, taken from NFL teams, were created for <i>NFL GameDay 2000</i> with the help of more than 30 players such as Broncos RB Terrell Davis, Packers WR Antonio Freeman, Falcons CB Ray Buchanan, Raiders DT Darrell Russell and Chiefs WR Derrick Alexander &#150; just to name a few. Plus, <i>NFL GameDay 2000</i> has more than double the amount of plays of <i>NFL GameDay&#153; &#146;99</i>.<br>					<br>					<i>NFL GameDay 2000&#146;s</i> cutting-edge technology translates into jaw-dropping graphics that capture the power and athleticism of the NFL.

For the first time, players can break ankle tackles and drag would-be tacklers on second and third efforts.<br>					<br>					New artificial intelligence (AI) has players reacting just as they do in the NFL. Read and Attack AI&#153; has offensive players reading the defense and making adjustments on the fly, while Pre-Snap AI&#153; allows the defense to make line shifts based on the offensive formations. The new &quot;Play As Any Skill Player&quot; feature lets the gamer become the quarterback, running back, wide receiver or tight end with the press of a button. Gamers can throw cut blocks as a tight end for a running back, or, as a receiver, signal the quarterback to throw the ball.<br>					<br>					The new &quot;GM Mode&quot; lets the videogamer play in multiple seasons as a coach, player or general manager. Gamers can control the everyday activities of a team over several seasons. State-of-the-art &quot;Training Camp Mode&quot; lets the gamer sharpen his skills and increase his knowledge of various offensive and defensive playbooks. The revolutionary &quot;Play Editor&quot; lets the gamer design his favorite plays and save them to a custom playbook. Players can also direct how and where each player will move by assigning individual routes, blocking schemes and defensive alignments and assignments. And, <i>NFL GameDay 2000</i> has refined the &quot;Create Player&quot; feature, allowing gamers to customize a player&#146;s physical appearance, salary and mental makeup.<br>					<br>					</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>NFL GameDay 2000 Key Features:<br>					</b></font></p>					<ul>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">All-new 3D player and stadium models and motion captured animation from 13 different NFL players, including Charles Woodson, Akili Smith, Jimmy Smith and Mike Alstott</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">World renowned sportscasters Dick Enberg and Phil Simms provide new play-by-play and color commentary</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">All 31 NFL teams (including the Cleveland Browns and Tennessee Titans) and more than 1,500 NFL players all scaled to actual height, weight and body style</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">1,240 new plays designed by more than 30 NFL players containing the latest trends, formations and plays </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Revolutionary Telestrator provides incredible TV-style instant replay with insight and analysis from Phil Simms</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In-depth NFL player ratings and updated 1999 team rosters, including rookies, free agent signings and trades</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Gamers have the ability to import senior college players from 989 Sports&#146; college football videogame <i>NCAA&reg; GameBreaker&#153; 2000</i> and have them play with the pros in <i>NFL GameDay 2000</i></font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">State-of-the-art &quot;Training Camp Mode&quot; lets the gamer sharpen his skills and increase his knowledge of various offensive and defensive playbooks.
