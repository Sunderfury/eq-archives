Exclusively for the					PlayStation&reg; game console, Cardinal Syn is a departure from traditional					fighting games, with its added dimension of interactivity for					players. <br>					<br>					&#147;In the videogame industry, where the fighting game genre makes					up about 20 percent of total sales, Cardinal Syn will do extremely					well because it not only delivers the fundamental elements of					a true fighter but goes beyond that to deliver an entirely new					dimension in fighting,&#148; said Jeffrey Fox, vice president, marketing,					989 Studios. &#147;Cardinal Syn replaces the typical battle arena found					in most fighting games with impressive interactive environments,					all within an evolving 3D world.&#148;<br>					<br>					Unique to Cardinal Syn are non-traditional, 3D arenas that challenge					the player with interactive elements, allowing players to trap,					corner or dispose of their opponents. The interactive elements					include lava streams, spike-lined walls and sizzling acid pools.					Gameplayers can gain the upper hand by maneuvering around the					environmental hazards or using them against their enemies.<br>					<br>					Treasure chests containing health-replenishing tonics and weapon					power-ups add a challenging risk-reward element unlike any other					fighting game. The unique risk-reward element forces players to					be completely aware of the game environment and provides incentive					to explore.<br>					<br>					Cardinal Syn pits medieval warriors against each other using weapons					&#150; such as battle-axes, swords and maces &#150; magical powers and hand-to-hand					combat. Through motion-captured animation, the game has 18 original					characters, which includes two secret warriors. Players will be					able to execute hundreds of complex precision moves, multi-hit					aerial combos, juggles, dismemberment and gruesome finishing moves.					The fighting action evolves around a dark and intriguing plot					riddled with clans of evil warriors, dangerous weapons and devastating					fatalities as intense as they are gory. Cardinal Syn is a 989					Studios production, developed by Kronos Digital Entertainment					Inc.<br>					<b><br>					Cardinal Syn Key Features</b><br>					Fully interactive 3D environments</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Medieval, non-traditional arenas</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">18 compelling characters, including two hidden warriors </font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Power-ups on every level</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Secret areas</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Survival, training and tournament modes</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Immersive 3D graphics</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">More than 100 moves, including special attacks, projectiles and					elaborate combos </font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Dismemberment-based finishing moves<br>					<br>					989 Studios, a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, is a					wholly-owned division of Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.					and the third-largest PlayStation&reg; software publisher in North					America.
