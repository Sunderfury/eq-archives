Each					of these continents comes with its own diverse species, economic					systems, alliances and politics. Throughout this adventure, players					form groups, strategic alliances and gather magical artifacts					in their perilous and exciting quest to conquer the world of Norrath.<br>					<br>					On their journey, players have the opportunity to earn experience					points, discover hidden treasure and acquire new skills. With					more than 40 unique skills and innate abilities per character,					the player can become the noblest of knights or the most vicious					elf. For those who are magically inclined, there are more than					100 spells in five separate magic classes to protect them as they					explore the rich and vast world of dungeons, towers, crypts and					evil abbeys throughout the game&#146;s many dimensions.<br>					<br>					Adventurers can explore the world of Norrath alone, but are encouraged					to form alliances to acquire knowledge, solve puzzles and travel					to strange, sometimes dangerous lands. Players can also interact					with characters controlled by other gamers -- some good, some					bad -- as well as computer controlled non-player characters.<br>					<br>					Unlike other Internet role playing games, EverQuest allows players					to view the 3D environment from a number of different camera angles,					and is optimized to support the latest 3D graphic accelerator					technology from 3Dfx Interactive&#153; and Microsoft&#147; Direct 3D&#153;.<br>					<br>					<b>EverQuest Key Features</b><br>					Supports more than a 1,000 players simultaneously per server </font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Immerse yourself in beautiful 3D environments</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Provides SVGA (640x480) 16-bit color scenery of dungeons, arctic					tundra, vast deserts and even a completely underwater environment					</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Player killing (Pkilling) is available to those who wish to participate					in this mode, while those who do not wish to participate in Pkilling					are immune </font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Choose from 12 races and 14 classes, including dwarves, ogres,					trolls, rangers, wizards and rogues</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">More than 40 unique skills and innate abilities per character</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Collect thousands of magical items, including artifacts of great					power</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Hundreds of spells to learn in five separate magic using classes</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Optimized for the latest 3D graphic accelerator technology, EverQuest					supports Voodoo Graphics&#153; by 3Dfx Interactive&#153; and Microsoft&reg;					Direct3D&#153;<strong><br>					<br>					</strong></font></td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td colspan="2" align="center">&nbsp; <a href="../../../index_studios.html" target="_top"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">					<hr>					989 Studios</font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> | <a href="../../../index_sports.html" target="_top">989 Sports</a> | <a href="../../playstation/index.html" target="_top">PlayStation Games</a> | <a href="../../pc/index.html" target="_top">PC Games</a> | <a href="../../promotions/index.html" target="_top">Promotions</a> | <a href="../corp.html" target="_top">Corporate</a> | <a href="../../../cgi-bin/search/index.html" target="_top">Search<br>					</a></font></td>			</tr>		</table>	</body></html>
