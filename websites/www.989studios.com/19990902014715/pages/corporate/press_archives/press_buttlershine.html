We look forward to them						helping us achieve our goals.&quot;<br>						<br>						Butler, Shine &amp; Stern was chosen following 989 Studios&#146; agency						review, which involved a handful of undisclosed firms. The agencies						were invited to present a strategic advertising plan in support						of 989 Studios and 989 Sports&#153; titles. 989 Studios 1999 North						American advertising budget is 15 million dollars.<br>						Greg Stern, President of Butler, Shine &amp; Stern noted: &quot;This was						a perfect pitch situation. We had the opportunity to date before						getting married by first working on a few projects with 989 Studios.						We enjoyed the collaborative working environment this client creates,						their appreciation of distinctive creative work, and we think						their games are among the best in the industry.&quot; <br>						<br>						In April 1998, Sony Computer Entertainment Amercia Inc. (SCEA)						announced the formation of dedicated software publishing unit						and the company&#146;s new name -- 989 Studios. As an independent software						publisher, 989 Studios is working to strengthen its brand identity						with all of its top-selling titles. Retaining Butler, Shine &amp;						Stern, an advertising agency separate from SCEA&#146;s, helps solidify						the company&#146;s independence. 989 Studios continued to retain TBWA/Chiat						Day, SCEA&#146;s advertising agency of record, throughout 1998.<br>						<br>						&quot;We were fortunate to be able to work with TBWA/Chiat Day during						our transitioning period,&quot; said Fox. &quot;Chiat&#146;s highly successful						print and television campaigns helped build brand recognition						for 989&#146;s top-selling franchise titles and we appreciate their						dedication to our business.&quot; Butler, Shine &amp; Stern, based in Sausalito,						CA, is an advertising agency that provides strategically focused,						award-winning and effective creative advertising and integrated						marketing solutions. In addition to 989 Studios, their clients						include Borders Books &amp; Music, E-greetings Network, Jamba Juice,						Millers Outpost, Seagram Wines, and R.A.B. Motors.<br>						<br>						989 Studios, a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, is a						wholly-owned division of Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.						and is the third-largest PlayStation&reg; software publisher in North						America. Headquartered in Foster City, California, with additional						development studios in San Diego and Santa Monica, 989 Studios						develops software for the PlayStation game console, personal computer						and online markets. 989 Studios is a recognized leader in the						videogame industry, with top franchise titles such as NFL GameDay&#153;,						Twisted Metal&reg;, Jet Moto&#153; and Cool Boarders&#147;.<br>						</font></div>				</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td colspan="2" align="center">&nbsp; <a href="../../../index_studios.html" target="_top"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">					<hr>					989 Studios</font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> | <a href="../../../index_sports.html" target="_top">989 Sports</a> | <a href="../../playstation/index.html" target="_top">PlayStation Games</a> | <a href="../../pc/index.html" target="_top">PC Games</a> | <a href="../../promotions/index.html" target="_top">Promotions</a> | <a href="../corp.html" target="_top">Corporate</a> | <a href="../../../cgi-bin/search/index.html" target="_top">Search<br>					</a></font></td>			</tr>		</table>		<center>			<p>&nbsp;</p>			<p>&nbsp;</p>			<p>&nbsp;</p>			<p>&nbsp;</p>			<p>&nbsp;</p>			<p>&nbsp;</p>			<p>&nbsp;</p>			<p>&nbsp;</center>	</body></html>
