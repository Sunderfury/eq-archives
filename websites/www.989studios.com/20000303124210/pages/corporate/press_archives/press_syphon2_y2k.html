A 3D action-adventure videogame, <i>Syphon Filter 2</i> offers more of what kept <i>Syphon Filter</i> on the 1999 PlayStation &quot;best-seller&quot; list, with the addition of all-new features, levels, a two-player mode and a comprehensive arsenal of weapons.    <br>						<br>						Players must use both cunning and stealth in order to combat new challenges and threats that can make it difficult to solve mission objectives.  To help gameplayers accomplish their mission, <i>Syphon Filter 2</i> features sophisticated third-person gunplay, and combines the thrill and compelling storyline of a blockbuster action movie with immersive graphics and unbeatable gameplay.   <br>						<br>							<i>&quot;Syphon Filter </i>set the benchmark for the action-adventure genre with its intriguing storyline and thrilling gameplay,&quot; said Jeffrey Fox, vice president, marketing, 989 Studios.  &quot;<i>Syphon Filter 2</i> will again raise the standard with exciting new features, enhanced weaponry and even more advanced gameplay, which will now be available for two person play.&quot;     <br>						<br>						In <i>Syphon Filter 2</i>, the action never stops as players trade gun shots with some of the deadliest commandos in the world.  Playing as either Gabriel Logan or Lian Xing (depending on the level) players must fight their way through more than 20 intense global levels, using a deadly arsenal of weapons, including cross bows, grenade launchers and sniper rifles.  Amazingly fluid gameplay motions allow Logan and Xing to keep enemies in target while they run, crouch, roll, climb and jump on moving vehicles.  In the game, dynamic real-time lighting, the effects of gunshots and fiery explosions are played out in amazing detail.  <i>Syphon Filter 2</i> players can also expect an all-new two-player mode with split-screen gameplay modes for head-to-head combat action.         <br>						<br>						Players will enter the deadly world of Secret Agent Gabriel Logan and Lian Xing.  Framed for a crime they did not commit, Logan and Xing must race against the clock in order to prevent the sale of the <i>Syphon Filter</i> virus to a terrorist nation.  Faced with unbeatable odds, Logan and Xing try to stop the conspiracy plot that reaches up to the top levels of government.  The action never stops as Logan and Xing travel from the streets of Moscow to the Agency&#146;s secret Syphon Filter lab, in what may be the last mission of their careers.  <i>Syphon Filter</i> is a 989 Studios production, developed by Eidetic, Inc.<br>						<br>						<i><b>Syphon Filter 2</b></i><b> Key Features</b></font></p>						<ul>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Two-disk set: explore intense, global environments, including three worlds with more than 20 all new thrilling levels. <br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Two-player mode, which offers 20 action-packed split-screen gameplay arenas.<br>							</font>							<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Gabe Logan&#146;s counterpart, Lian Xing, is now a playable character.
