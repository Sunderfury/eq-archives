The &#145;Cool Boarders 3 Videogame					Challenge&#146; will provide an opportunity for the best snowboarders					from the best resorts to pull off all the snowboarding tricks					they&#146;ve already learned on the mountain, plus a ton more that					they&#146;d be afraid to actually try.&quot;<br>					<br>					With its advanced 3D game engine, Cool Boarders 3 lets the videogamer					feel every rock, bump, ice patch and jump, while competing on					34 courses over five tenacious mountains. Players can select from					22 authentic snowboards, which include sixteen Burton&#147; Snowboards					and six Ride&#147; Snowboards, each created with real performance ratings					for acceleration, control, responsiveness and flexibility. <br>					<br>					To further increase the realism of the Cool Boarders 3 experience,					professional snowboarders&#146; signature moves have been motion captured					to provide the most realistic snowboarding game animations possible.					This includes 35 real jaw-dropping snowboarding maneuvers and					thousands of combos like Front Side 540&#146;s, Back Side Ally-Oops,					Back Flips, Tail Grabs and 360&#146;s.<br>					<br>					989 Studios, a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, is a					wholly-owned division of Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.					and is the third-largest PlayStation&reg; software publisher in North					America.
