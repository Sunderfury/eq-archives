Players can choose from 13 different polygonal characters, each with distinct looks and attributes. Using skateboards, in-line skates and BMX&#153; bikes, players race through 27 challenging 3D tracks that stretch across five diverse locations including islands, coastlines, subway stations and city parks.<br>					<br>					&quot;We have truly captured the unique feeling of each distinctive sport in <i>3Xtreme</i>,&quot; said Jeffrey Fox, vice president, marketing, 989 Studios. &quot;<i>3Xtreme</i> builds upon the success of its two predecessors by adding in hundreds of tricks and new fighting moves. Plus, the enhanced graphics truly add to the game&#146;s realism.&quot;<br>					<br>					Players can execute unique moves using a skateboard, bike or in-line skates. While performing various trick moves, players are rewarded points based on their execution of each move and can use the points to upgrade their equipment. To become the Xtreme champion, players must master radical maneuvers, including 360 degree &quot;Indy Grabs&quot; on the skateboard, &quot;Tabletops&quot; on BMX bikes and &quot;Grinds&quot; on the in-line skates. <i>3Xtreme</i> also incorporates a fighting element, which adds to the fast-action gameplay.<br>					</font></p>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i><b>3Xtreme</b></i><b> Key Features</b></font></p>					<ul>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">3D polygonal Xtreme sports videogame with high-resolution player models</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Race on skateboards, in-line skates and BMX bikes</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Choose from 13 individual polygonal racers -- each with their own distinct attributes and looks</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Five unique locations: Island, Coastal, Subway, Park and the Los Angeles River </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">12 different tracks in season mode, five different freestyle tracks and 10 different time trial tracks </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">27 track variations</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Choose one or two player split-screen</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Five modes to choose from: Season, Freestyle, Time Trial, Head-to-Head and Exhibition</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Perform more than 270 awesome tricks with your character to earn points</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Unlock new courses, hidden characters and secret shortcuts</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Upgrade your equipment as you earn points</font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Players can access a split-screen, two player freestyle mode that allows them to execute freestyle moves and tricks<br>						Xtreme athletes Andy MacDonald (skateboarding), Chris Potts (biking) and Todd Grossman </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">(in-line skating) were motion captured to provide added realism </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Xtreme in-game sport manufacturer partners: Trek&reg;, K2&reg;, GT&copy;, Haro&reg;, Redline&reg;, Tum Yeto&reg;, Santa Cruz&reg; and Salomon&reg; </font>						<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Xtreme in-game consumer brand partners: Billabong&#153;, Levi&#146;s&reg; Silver Tab&reg; and Slim Jim&reg; </font>					</ul>					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><br>					989 Studios, a Sony Computer Entertainment Group Company, is a wholly-owned division of Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. and is the third-largest PlayStation&reg; software publisher in North America.
