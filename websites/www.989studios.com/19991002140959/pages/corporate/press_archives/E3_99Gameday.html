All-new stadiums are detailed to perfection, including field wear and tear and animated backgrounds. An updated TV-style presentation incorporates dramatic camera angles as well as new commentary by world renowned sportscasters Dick Enberg and Phil Simms.<br>					<br>					<i>NFL GameDay 2000</i> reflects the trends and schemes of the NFL with actual NFL player input -- from motion capture animations to plays designed by real NFL players.
