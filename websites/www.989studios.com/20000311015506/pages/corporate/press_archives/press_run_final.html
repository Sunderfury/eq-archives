Each character has					a signature racing style and special attributes that add to their					superior animal athleticism.<br>					<br>					Running Wild challenges gameplayers to rocket through six courses					of rigorous terrain, including hot lava fields, frozen rivers,					drainage tunnels and winding city streets. In addition to the					high-speed race, obstacle ridden game environments provide a challenging					element to the gameplay.<br>					<br>					&quot;Running Wild is one of the first combination racing and character					action games, which are the number one and number three most popular					console video game genres,&quot; said Mark Cerny, president of Universal					Interactive Studios. &quot;The title offers a stunning 60 frames per					second to support intense speed and action, and boasts excellent					depth of play with mighty power-ups that let players really &quot;run					wild&#146;.&quot;<br>					<br>					Adding to Running Wild&#146;s appeal to gameplayers of all ages and					skill levels is the option that allows gameplayers to decrease					the game&#146;s level of difficulty. Difficulty levels can be adjusted					by accessing the &quot;Auto Run&quot; option which automatically operates					the accelerator button on the game pad, allowing gameplayers to					focus on maneuvering the characters -- a helpful feature for younger					gameplayers.<br>					<br>					Featuring adjustable game modes, Running Wild roars at 60 frames					per second in single player mode.
