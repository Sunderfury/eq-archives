<P Class="info"><span><b><a name="Rumors">Rumors:</a></span></b> 

<p class="main">I was hunting dwarf skeletons in Butcherblock,
when a Dwarf Warrior by the name
of <b>Durbauk</b> started seeking the help
of all in the area to find an
<b>Erudite</b> that "changes" bodies.
'I assume an Enchanter', he said. 
This Erudite last seen in gnome
form was seeking the <b>Heart of Stone</b>,
and he was to deliver a message to him.
Upon further probing I asked the name of this
Erudite and he said he couldn't pronounce it
but it started with an 'A', and then he left
muttering something about her whim and
who would protect her, I am not sure of whom he was speaking.

<p><h3> Soerbaird Concert</h3>


<P Class="main"> Sunday, April 25th, and Monday, April 26th, the <b>Soerbaird</b> kicked off the first of their hopefully soon to be monthly concert performances.  Despite a protest by the Norrath Anarchist society, a wedding proposal, and a few over-zealous drunks swaying back and forth in the audience, these Norrathian bards captured the attentions and the hearts of most spectators present in Sunday's Concert. When asked how he felt the concert went, Dain, Ollave of the Balladry Filidh, responded:

<p class="main">"It went really well, considering all I imagined could go wrong!  My fellow
bards were in good form, Jythri was a masterful master of ceremonies, and
the audience was the best I could have hoped for.  No one fell prey to
narcolepsy, which is common when viewing large crowds and the bane of all
performers in Norrath.

<p class="main">"I would like to thank Lillith, our enchanter retainer, for providing crowd
control in the form of invisibility spells at key moments.  I recall one
drunken fan lept at me while I was performing.  Lillith thought fast and the
drunk vanished before I could miss a beat.  Daithi, our Ollave of the
Brehon, is an accomplished artist and was on hand to quickly paint scenes
from the concert.

<p class="main">"The Soerbaird spent some time planning the event, and we are very pleased
with the results. "

<p><h3> Heartstone Update </h3>
<p class="main"> <i>What is the Heartstone?</i> &nbsp; <b> Sauleth</b><i> has this to say:</i> <p class="main">"Heartstone is difficult to describe (for obvious reasons). Some factions believe it is a mythical, magical artifact with immense power. Other factions believe that it is the "heart" of Norrath, a physical representation of the lifeforce of the world. Others believe that it is a vile infection that threatens the safety of the world. And others
 have no idea that it exists. Some seek to control it. Some seek to protect it. Some seek to destroy it. Some have no idea what's going on." 
<p class="main"><b> Greywulf</b>, <b>Scribe of the Arcane Adventurers</b> <i> reports: </i>
<p class="main"> A couple of weeks ago the <b>Arcane
Adventurers</b> completed the ruins quest for the Erudin Sage Kassalman to help him in his research of the Heartstone.  A week later Cyxe, leader
of the Arcane Adventurers, met with Kassalman and gave the sketches of the ruins and their locations.  Kassalman said that he would meet with Cyxe sometime
during the next week to share with him whatever he has discovered from his research.  
 
<p class="main"> Meanwhile, Kassalman mentioned that there were some clerics wandering around Norrath talking of the Heartstone and wanting to reward the
guild that finished Kassalman's quest.  These clerics are to be believed to know a bit about the Heartstone.  A few days later a crazed man came
up to Aradon of the guild <b>The Aredhel</b> in Lesser Faydark, babbling about clerics or paladins (Aradon wasn't sure what this man was saying), and
something about the Heartstone.  This madman mentioned that he was diseased or poisoned, and commited suicide by throwing himself into the
dagger of a dervish bandit.  
 
<p class="main"> Saturday the 24th, Cyxe met with Kassalman once again to find out what his discovery was.  It's been rumored that it is quite a discovery
and if anyone is curious what the discovery is they would have to talk to a member of the <b>Arcane Adventurers</b>.  
 
<p class="main"> In other news, a man by the name of Obuidar was killed yesterday by a sentinal in Erudin.  He was found guilty of being a traitor to Erudin and
abuse of their ways of magic.  In his last dying breath he had a grin and said, "The new order will come, a new house will arise."


<p><h3> People's Market </h3>
<p class="info">"For the People By the People" 

<p class="main"> <b>Merle</b> of <b>ForeverQuest</b> is promoting an "old fashioned Bazaar" to be held weekly. The merchants involved sprout from Faydwer, and the last bazaar was held in Kelethin on Saturday, April 24th. In the future the group hopes to travel and bring wares to different areas in Norrath. Look for these merchants, coming to your area soon!

<p class="info">My friends, we are searching for <b>able-bodied news writers</b>. My guild master tells me that I am very bad in my jewelry-making effort, and I need quite a bit more practice. For some reason, he just doesn't understand how the newspaper consumes so much of my time. We seek those with talented language skills, and who are able to record the history of Norrath with great accuracy. If you are interested, please give us a note that includes some information about yourself, your skills and qualifications.
