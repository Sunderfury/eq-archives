<P CLASS="MAIN"><SPAN>The</SPAN>  local recession in Qeynos, advancement of the gnolls in the area and cold climate all made us look forward to a new place to establish our business. Except members from the House of Sinanju, a group of younger adventurers lead by Galce the barbarian was going to follow us. Personally I had nothing against that at all. Leaving lambs to the slaughter might be a good move for us, although I am sure Caliban didn't agree with me. I was confident that Bertoxxulous had not chosen me to die that day.  

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="_0.jpg"></CENTER>

<P CLASS="MAIN">We left at midday. Leaving Qeynos brought some happiness to my heart. I knew that I would not return for a long time. Our large group brought some attention in the hills outside Qeynos and we met Kassia, a beautiful woman that I really started to like before I realized she was a filthy paladin. Ah well, seeking a conflict could be done later. Maybe I could lure her into the wrong tunnel near Runneye?
The sun set over the hills of Karana. The open land with its beauty, the good mood amongst the travellers and the lack of monsters made this part of the journey enjoyable. A crooked smile crossed my lips when I recalled that I had "forgotten" to repay Sneed the 8 platinum pieces I owed him. "The fool, that's what he got for trusting me". The sun had barely hid itself from us when a growl and a scream cut through the night. Caliban and Tyne stopped immediately. I was about to say "it's probably nothing, lets move on", when Caliban ordered the party to a halt. Although our enlightened leader has the weak mercy and compassion of an elf, I do trust his judgement. 
<P CLASS="MAIN">A lioness had attacked one of the younger adventurers in the party behind us. I growled and cursed the evil druids that obviously had sent this lion on us to thwart our journey. I prepared to engage the beast with the rusty halberd I had stolen from a farmer that attacked me last month, when brother Rieu, bless his magic skills, put the beast on fire. I recall I noticed the dried in blood on the halberds shaft, and I recall putting my heavy axe between the shoulderblades on the farmer, ending his screams.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><h4>Trouble in the Karanas</h4>
<P CLASS="MAIN">The giants and the griffins had left us alone. The gigantic wooden suspension bridge over the river stirred our emotions. What a place! Eager to reach our destination, we proceeded through the north parts of Karana, following the treeline near the mountains. At that time, our troubles began.
<P CLASS="MAIN">Lethe, a young woman in the second party had fallen a bit behind. We never realized she was in trouble until it was too late. I do not recall what killed her, but I hope she did not suffer too much. Rieu and Tyne turned back to rescue her belongings. We had put up a campfire outside the minotaur gorge near Runneye. A griffawn slowly flew by us. Fear was spreading throughout the party as rumors of Lethes demise reached the members. A shout from behind us told us that Rieu and Tyne also had run into trouble. I still regret that I wasn't there to help them. Tyne is always so happy, I would throw myself in front of a mammoth to save her. 
<P CLASS="MAIN">We stayed nearly a day outside the gorge. Rieu and Tyne caught up with us after successfully retrieving their eqiupment. But before that, the other party, impatient to reach Rivervale, decided to test their luck in the gorge. A shady looking character going under the name "Assassin" aided them. I have heard different stories but it seems that Assassin made some of them invisible. These persons (Galce being one of them) survived the journey. Others were slaughtered in the gorge. Ah well, with the minotaurs well-fed, we could perhaps stand a chance against them.

<P><H4>The gorge and Runneye</H4>
<P CLASS="MAIN">The king's gorge is a hostile place. Caliban instructed us to climb on the wall and avoid the path at all cost. The minotaurs and elders turned out to be incentive enough for us. I was a bit behind Caliban, Tyne and Rieu, when I stepped on a loose rock. The rock fell down and my fingers desperately grasped after something solid. I fell hard and the well-known feeling of panic sent chills down my spine. I cursed Bertoxxulous for sending the loose rock in my way. Maybe that is why I was punished even more. I looked up and a minotaur wielded his axe against me. The axe hit me on the shoulder, I felt the bones in my skeleton break under its edge. At that point, I don't recall quite what happened. I guess I manage to make it back to the gorge, where another group of adventurers was kind enough to help me out. In retrospect, it was a rather sad story. I failed to defeat the minotaur and had to run away like an infidel. Well, an eagle may soar high up in the sky, but a griffin rarely catches a weasel.

<TD width=40%>
<P CLASS="MAIN">One of the adventurers was very kind. He cast a spell on me, which made me invisible! I started imagine the possibilities of stealing a dragons treasures just as I joined my comrades at the other end of the gorge.
<P CLASS="MAIN">We entered Runneye. I was still invisible. Out of the darkness, goblins attacked us. They hurt Tyne and Caliban badly. We had to retreat temporary. I stayed inside and after another party had cleared the entrance, we ran like we'd never done before. And we survived!
Rivervale
<P CLASS="MAIN">Rivervale. What a dump! A group of no more than 10-15 trolls and ogres could lead an assault from the west. Aided by saboteurs inside Rivervale, they could pave the way for the main force from the east, consisting of a dark elf army with supports from occational orc militia and undeads. My guess is that the merry halflings would all be dead after a day's fighting. The entrance to Rivervale is indeed easy to defend. But it wouldn't hold for long.
The party strolled through the forest of Misty Thicket. The sun playing with the leaves in the springtime forest might be visually attractive to a nature lover. I thought about the trees as a nice foundation for a fort that could stage the attack from the west on Rivervale. 
We passed through the deputys outside the wall. Funny, they looked so small. I could hardly imagine they could pose a threat to us... Or rather me. They did not seem hostile to me. Maybe because I was still invisible? Even a halfling could not calculate the evil plans I had in mind for them, if they could not see me. 
<P CLASS="MAIN">Entering Rivervale was a happy moment for all of us. We paused in the entrance tunnel. Rieu the wizard binded our souls to that tunnel. 
I have never been more terrified when I realized that the invisibility was gone and the sheriff was about to send his deputys on me. I hid inside the tunnel, whispering to my friends that the halflings obviously did not like me. Now, my mind was working on a way to escape, not to annihilate Rivervale.   


<P CLASS="MAIN"><H4>Change of plans</H4>
<P CLASS="MAIN">Originally our plans consisted of establishing ourselves on the black market in Rivervale. We would offer ourselves as mercenaries and make a fortune and hopefully a good name for the house. Instead, everyone was more or less agreeing with me, that perhaps continuing to Freeport might be a wiser solution. For obvious reasons, I strongly advocated this alternative. I told my friend that they would have to feed me in the tunnel otherwise, because I would end my days there, as an evil, disgruntled shadow. 
<P CLASS="MAIN">The halflings taunted me. They threw rotten tomatoes on me, laughed at me and said they would bring the sheriff. I was pale, the sweat on my forehead was not because of excitement before a battle but of the fear of my death. I secretly prayed to Bertoxxulous and was very sincere when I apologized for my blasphemy and my inferiority and my love affair with that young elf woman cleric in Qeynos a couple of years ago. 
<P CLASS="MAIN">Caliban finally found a halfling that had the power to make me invisible. It cost him a platinum piece. I had no wish to argue with the halfling about the price. Briefly I tried to recall his insect butt helmet as something to instruct the ogres to search for when they launched their first attack wave on Rivervale. Nevertheless, his spell saved me. We were able to leave Rivervale and the forest behind us. 
To Freeport!

<P CLASS="MAIN">The sun dawned on the third day as we ran through the commonlands. Staying on the high sand cliffs, our greatest dangers were the giants. I saw one of them walking half a kilometer away from us. Tyne said she found them handsome. I did not find her humorous remark very entertaining. Finally, we arrived to Freeport. 
<P CLASS="MAIN">Half of our group had been killed, and those of us who were alive did not care much about the dry desert wind or the murdering sunlight, but the fact that we were alive!
Arriving to Freeport opens up a golden opportunity for the House of Sinanju. Market and demand will soon put the House on a favorable position. I have personal goals too. Already I have made contact with some members of the local militia, who are tired of the paladin filth that preach justice and compassion. Freeport will be embraced in darkness. I have forseen it.
