<p class="main">I wanted to thank you again for making the trip to Freeport to assist me with my
assignments here.  Not only were you instumental in fulfilling my mission, it was also good to
again travel with a dear and respected friend such as yourself.  My only regret is that we were
unable to travel to Faydark to finish my task of dispatching the foul orcs that infest that
region.  I had no idea that we would be reassigned to a reconnaissance mission in the area
known as "Befallen".


<p class="main">I have since learned that the order to investigate the upper floors of Befallen came
from one of the top commanders in the Hall of Truth.  It seems they have a particular interest
in the recent influx of undead activity in that area.  I'm sure I would not have been able to
complete the scouting mission had it not been for your able assistance.  I'm certain we will
both not soon forget the terrible sights we witnessed in that place.  The eerie, blue glow that
hangs within that wretched tomb still sends a shiver to my spine and the tormented howling from
the tortured souls of the undead echoes through my dreams at night.


<p class="main">I issued a full report to my superiors about the many skeletons and zombies that we
encountered there.  I also brought back samples of their bones so that the clerics of the hall
could study their properties and attempt to discover the origins of their summoning.  I made a
special note in my report about the numerous plagued rats that we left littering the ground.
They were most pleased by the key that was discoverd on the body of the ShadowKnight that we
defeated.  I was surprised by the ease with which we dispatched the Knight.  Perhaps he was
only a guard for something much more sinister in the lower levels of that evil place.  I
included with the key, the map that you sketched out and I indicated on the map which door the
key opened.  I think your advice not to venture past that door was wise.  I fear that if the
terrible howls and screams were any indication, we would have been severly outmatched in that
area.  My captain said he would let me know if he requires me to investigate the lower levels
of that place.  Inwardly I hope I don't receive that assignment, but Mithaniel Marr's will is
unquestioned and I will do what I must.


<p class="main">Currently, I am in the midst of a rather interesting task.  I have been assigned as a
liason to a rather fascinating visitor to Freeport.  It seems that the Rivervale Militia has
sent over one of its finest members to explore Freeport and its surrounding regions.  I think
it is some sort of exchange program where we have sent one of our Paladins to Rivervale in
exchange for one of their militiamen.  This Halfling Warrior (who goes by the name of Beleric)
is an interesting character indeed.  I have never seen so much energy in all my days.  He
rarely stops moving and that holds true for his feet and his tongue.  He is constantly running
around, jabbering about something.  It took some getting used to at first.  All this activity
comes at a price, however.  I have never seen anyone or anything eat as much as this little
fellow.  Cakes, pies, fish, bread, rations. . . if it isn't tied down it will find its way into
the gullet of this vivacious Halfling.  What he lacks in table manners, though, he surely makes
up for in ability.  He is a valiant combatant and I am learning much from him.  I hope he gains
as much from his experience with me.


<p class="main">I am still traveling with Elorebaen, Aryndel and Aphra (all of whom you met on your
visit here).  Together with the Halfling Beleric we have been exploring the outer regions of
Freeport to give Beleric a feel for this great city.  Just yesterday we happened upon an
undiscovered outpost of orc centurians.  It appears that the orcs are once again trying to gain
another foothold in this region.  Undoubtedly, we will spend the next few days here dislodging
the orcs from this area.
        

<p class="main">The next correspondence you recieve from me will probably come from Rivervale as I plan
to escort Beleric back to his home when his time is up here.  Thank you again for your valuable
assistance last week.  I will look forward to my next visit to Halas where we can share a warm
tankard of Barbarian Ale.  Take care of yourself friend until we speak again.


<p class="main">Deepest Regards,
