 <P CLASS="MAIN">
There are so many strange and wonderful lands to explore and I know that there isn't any way that I will ever be able to explore them all, but I hope that by reading my tales, you too will be inclined to pack your bags and explore.  <P CLASS="MAIN">
I think that I will kick this off by telling you a little bit about my childhood.  As a young wood elf I lived in and around Kelethin on the continent of Faydwer.  Life here is very wonderful and there are many ways to spend a day.


 <P CLASS="MAIN">  From an early age I knew that I wanted to explore the life of a druid.  There was never any doubt.  My father was a warrior and my mother was a druid, and as such I learned many things while growing up. I had one half brother Hamelon, who has always been a little bigger and stronger than me.  I think that it was my dad's influence on him that led him to become a warrior.

</TD> <TD width=40%> <P CLASS="MAIN">
 <P CLASS="MAIN">  We spent many days and nights in the forests surrounding Kelethin practicing our skills on bats, rats, spiders, decaying skeletons and the occasional orc pawn that would venture a little too far from Crushbone.  Hamelon is a little older than me so he began traveling and adventuring before I was old enough to venture out of the forest.  He would always return telling me about his adventures in places as close by as Felewithe, the high-elf town or as far-away as Qeynos, on the other side of Norrath.
<P CLASS="MAIN">
I could hardly wait to join him in adventuring and he was just as excited to be able to show his little brother around, while protecting me from any harm.  I guess that should be enough background for now.  Come back in two weeks when I tell you about my first adventure away from home and the trip to Freeport.  It is something that you don't want to miss.
