<p class="main">The beggar was walking,<br>
The beggar was talking,<br>
The beggar was shouting its coming.<br>
The old world was torn,<br>
And new worlds were born,<br>
After the time<br>
Of the Sundering.<br>

<p class="main">Ash-blown winds come a-rolling through town<br>
Not a soul is walking<br>
Not a soul moves around.<br>
Save for the beggar with wild reddish eyes<br>
Cackling madly<br>
And shouting his cries.<br>

<p class="main">"Once you were mighty; once you were grand!<br>
Once you were Freeport<br>
The bastion of man."<br>
"Now as I dreamt, not a soul is alight!<br>
The demon has come<br>
And sundered your might!"

<p class="main">The beggar was walking,<br>
The beggar was talking,<br>
The beggar was shouting its coming.<br>
The old world was torn,<br>
And new worlds were born,<br>
After the time<br>
Of the Sundering.

<p class="main">Silence-paved streets rest in death's cold-clasped hands<br>
Not a citizen left<br>
Not a one in westland.<br>
Save for the beggar, dung-streaked and worn<br>
Yelling his taunts<br>
At the city forlorn.<br>

<p class="main">"Once you were mighty; once you were grand!<br>
Once you were Qeynos,<br>
Bayle's iron-clad stand!"<br>
Now where be your children, your women and old?<br>
Bhjaad flung out his wrath<br>
And barrened your fold!"<br>

<p class="main">The beggar was walking,<br>
The beggar was talking,<br>
The beggar was shouting its coming.<br>
The old world was torn,<br>
And new worlds were born,<br>
After the time<br>
Of the Sundering.<br>

<p class="main">Drought-laden beds of the river run dry<br>
The buildings are crumbled;<br>
Trees wither and die.<br>
The beggar walks proudly, a king of his heap<br>
Proclaiming his reign<br>
Over death's longing sleep.<br>

<p class="main">"Once you were mighty; once you were grand!"<br>
Once River-the-vale!<br>
The Tal'kein's last stand!<br>
Now where goes your courage? Your hubris-spawned strength?<br>
The green-one has split<br>
Your land at its length."
