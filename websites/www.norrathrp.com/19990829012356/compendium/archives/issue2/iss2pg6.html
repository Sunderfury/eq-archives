<P Class="main"><span><i>If</i></span> you are in need of something, can't find it, too far away, not enough in your local area, I am just the person to bring it to you. I operate on Antonica and Faydwer with most business being done in Freeport. My prices are fair and I am here to help you. Drop me a message in Norrath or send me a message <a href="mailto:syldren@hotmail.com">here</a>.<br>

<P Class="main"><span><i>Sqwint</i></span> needs small ore. Based out of Rivervale, if anyone passing through Highpass Hold east would wish to make a few extra coin on a small zero risk transaction, Sqwint is ready to pay 7silver for each block of small ore offered. The merchants there sell the stuff for less than that depending on your bartering skills , and while the profit margin wouldn't be great, Sqwint can meet you in the Kithicore so it's easy money. Amount desired depends on cash on hand, so contact Sqwint before purchasing. Also, if anyone in Qeynos can post this offer on one of the bulletin boards, it would be greatly appreciated.

<P Class="main"><span><i>I</i></span> will summon Food/Water/Bandages for a "small" price.  For food and
water I charge a mere 5 copper each.  As for the bandages, I charge 1
Silver for 4 bandages.  I charge low prices for 2 reasons, 1) They
vanish if you leave Norrath 2) I can summon and so they are free for me.

<P Class="main"><span><i>I</i></span> am a Barbarian.  I am looking for a Minotaur

try to figure out how to get to Freeport.<br><b>Dras Bullneck</b>


<P Class="main"><span><i>Hello</i></span> fellow citizens of Norrath! Need a ring or necklace made?  Perhaps something with enchanted metal? I am offering my services in this area, (currently a skill level of 23 and an excellent success rate with the smaller gems)  I would be happy to combine any metal/stones you might bring.  I offer no charge for this service, just the knowledge I gain during the attempt and accept no responsibility for failed attempts.  I am currently bound to erudin but will be moving to qeynos soon.  Give me word if I can help.<br>
