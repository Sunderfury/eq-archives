<P class="info"><b><span>The Tale of Naroon</b></span>
<p class="main">My name is Naroon Fel'neth. It is not a famous name, but my family name was well known within the Dwarven lands as being one of honesty, faith, and strength. My family are warrior priests, and have been for generations, serving the great Duke of Below, Brell Serilis.  My father wanted me to follow in his ways and become a warrior of Brell, but I would not have it. I had fallen for a beautiful dwarven lass named Laran Merick. Laran she had convinced me to accept an apprenticeship with her father, Fallon Merick, one of the riches merchants in the dwarven lands.  My father was disappointed in me, but accepted my decision.

<p class="main">In truth, for a while it was the happiest time of my life. I had a beautiful wife, a good trade to learn, and my whole life ahead of me.  Fallon was a fair master, although he was rather closed mouthed about some of his trade partners.  He would often travel to the mountains, and be gone for days. He brought no goods when he left, nor did he return with any .  When I would ask him about this, he would tell me he was discussing possible trade relations with an unnamed source.  He assured me that when the time was right, I would be brought into the negotiations with him.

<p class="main"> One day, while revelling in how nicely my life was going, I was approached by my father.  He told me that Fallon had started spreading rumors among the folk that they need not donate as much of their money to the church.  I asked my father why Fallon would spread rumors like this, what good would it do him?  My father told me that Fallon donated none of his money to the church, and in order for him to gain power in certain circles, he needed to make this practice common.  I told my father that I believed his rumors to be unfounded, and I had work to do. My father left and I could tell he was disappointed in me.  When I told Laran about what my father had said, she told me that it was true that her father donated no money to the church, but that was his right, and my father was just trying to upset me to the point of joining him in the church.

 <p class="main">A few days later I was surprised to hear Fallon, cursing as he hooked up his pony. I overheard him saying that he was going to get even.  I asked Fallon if everything was all right.  I should have noticed the strange glint in his eyes, as he looked over at me and told me that things were fine.  He then told me that I needed to take a trip across the ocean to Antonica, and pick up a wagonload of ore from a merchant in Freeport. I forgot all my suspicions  when he gave me this job to do.  A mere apprentice being asked to take this trip was an incredible honor. 

 I ran back to my house and told Laran of my good luck.  I think she was more proud of me then I was.  I packed up what I needed and started on my way.  The trip went without problems, and I was returning to Kaladim  when I noticed that people were looking at me strangely. I thought surely it must be envy, for I would soon be a master trader.

 <p class="main">As I entered Kaladim I noticed signs of a recent struggle I thought to my self that there had probably been a snake uprising and some of the younger warriors had taken on a bit too much. Continuing on down the street  I approached Fallon's.  I was completely surprised to find that the windows and doors had been boarded up, and there was not a soul around. I yelled and bang at the door, but no one answered.  I noticed a young dwarf watching me from the alley. I asked him where the owner of the shop was. The young dwarf then said that I should ask the captain of the guard. The guard Captain had said that any visitors to Fallon's be directed to him. I asked him why, what had happened here.  I was again told to ask the Captain.  I then made my way to the barracks to inquire what was going on

 <p class="main">As I approached the Captain's quarters I again noticed the strange looks I was getting from everyone. Captain Garod was a good man, and I had known him most of my life.  He looked up from his papers at me entering. As I saw him comprehend who I was, I also noticed a look of complete misery entering his face. He told me that he had been awaiting my return, and he had some horrible news.  

<p class="main">It seems that my father had been trying to get the town council to assess fines on  Fallon for not paying donations to the church.  Fallon had heard about this and gone crazy.  The new trade relations that Fallon had been working on were with a powerful  Goblin Lord named Grradl.  Fallon approached Grradl with the prospect of scaring my father into stopping his harassment of Fallon.  Grradl agreed, and they planned a way for Fallon to sneak some of Grradl's  most elite troops into Kaladim, and they would take care of things.

 <p class="main">At this point I interrupted Garod.  The thought that any dwarf would try and deal with a Goblin was amazed me.  Garod told me that they believe that Fallon had been slowly worked on by one of the Goblin Shaman. The Shaman had warped Fallon's mind into thinking  that the Goblins were his friends.  Garod continued and told me that once the goblins had entered the city and made their way to my fathers house, things went differently  then Fallon had planned.

 <p class="main">You must remember that Goblins  mistakenly think that Brell Serilis created them first. They would take any chance they could to  hurt the Dwarven church. So instead of the Goblins scaring my father, they entered his home and brutally murdered everyone in it. Upon hearing of my fathers death at the hands of these vile beasts, I let out a dreadful wail.  My father had done nothing to deserve this type of fate.

<p class="main">Captain Garod tried to quite my anguish, and yelled at me to be still, he was not finished. I forced my anger down with great difficulty, and listened to the atrocities committed by the Goblins as they rampaged through the town.  He then told me of my sweet Laran and told me that she had been one of the townsfolk that had been brutally raped and murdered, before the town guards could kill off all of the Goblins.

 I felt something inside of me break, my Laran had been violated by these vermin, I then felt something in my mind break.  I am told that I went quite mad then, foaming at the mouth, moaning and crying from my grief.  I broke out of the captains office, stripped my self naked and went running into the mines. Many of my friends tried to stop me, but my strength was that of a madman.  How long I wondered the mines was a mystery to me, I am told that it was over two weeks. 

<p class="main">The next thing I remember was a feeling as though I was floating.  I felt a warm hand brush my brow, and a voice said "Naroon, you shall now be my instrument".

<p class="main"> Surprised, I  opened my eyes and looked into the beautiful face of Brell Serilis.

 <p class="main">"Naroon," he said, "you rebuked my ways before, will you not heal yourself, by accepting my ways and becoming the warrior of Brell that you should be?"

 <p class="main">I was ashamed. I was the one that caused the death of my father and my beloved Laran, why would the Duke seek me. 

<p class="main">" Ahh, I read your thoughts Naroon. Indeed, you have seen much grief, much anger, and much fear. Who better to console others that need it, and destroy enemies that require it? You have been picked Naroon, except it, or you shall perish alone, down here in the mines, never to avenge your father and wife"

 <p class="main">At the mention of revenge, a surge went through my body. If I were to have the power of Brell Serilis behind me I could extract my revenge upon the Goblins, and find Fallon!. 

<p class="main">"Naroon you chose to follow for the wrong reasons, but you shall learn" and with that Brell Serilis was gone. 

<p class="main">Finding myself feeling remarkably well rested , I  wondered through the mines and found my way back to town.  I must have looked a terrible sight, but the fear I saw registering on the townspeople faces could not be explained by my merely looking disheveled.  A friend of mine, Dugar Sharn, approached me and asked me what had happened.  I related the incidents as best I knew them and told the story of meeting the Duke. 

<p class="main">"But Naroon, what of your face?" my friend inquired.

 <p class="main">What is he talking about, I thought,  as I reached up to feel my face . What I felt there struck me first with revulsion, then... it became clear, and I started to laugh uncontrollably. The townsfolk thought that I had surely gone mad again, they called for the captain. When Garod approached, I regained control of myself. 

<p class="main">"Don't you see!"  I shouted at the people, "I am as a child again born anew.  Brell Serilis had given me a new beginning, but had taken my beard in return."

<p class="main">Thus began a new day for me.  I was like a babe in the woods, finding my way through life again. But I also made a pledge that day, and I will keep it, or die. 

 <p class="main">For now I scour the lands, and one day<br>
... I shall find Fallon<br>
... and he shall pay.
