<p class="main">In Antonica's land there was a gnoll<br>
Whose size was small and deeds were bold<br>
Fippy Darkpaw from Sabretooth Clan<br>
Whose land was stolen by the human man<br>

<p class="main">His entire being did yearn for revenge<br>
And on one thing did his plan hinge<br>
"To free my people I must kill Bayle"<br>
"And when I do my clan prevails"

<p class="main">When human travelers he did meet<br>
He left them bleeding at his feet, saying<br>

<p class="main">"YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP AROOOO!<br>
Fippy Darkpaw will slay all of you!<br>
YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP BAAARRRK!<br>
Fippy Darkpaw must leave his mark!<br>
YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP GRRRRR!<br>
For Sabretooth Clan I will endure!"<br>

<p class="main">His plan was not yet fully formed<br>
The Qeynos gates had never been stormed<br>
He did not know how to reach Bayle<br>
To find out how, he must travail
<br>
<p class="main">Fippy would travel to other clans<br>
And ask those gnolls to help him plan<br>
The best defenses born of man<br>
Against the wisest gnolls found in the land<br>

<p class="main">As he traveled o'er the broken ground<br>
He shouted out to all around<br>

<p class="main">"YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP AROOOO!<br>
Fippy Darkpaw will slay all of you!<br>
YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP BAAARRRK!<br>
Fippy Darkpaw will leave his mark!<br>
YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP GRRRRR!<br>
For Sabretooth Clan I must endure!"<br>

<p class="main">First north to Blackburrow--no help there<br>
They were beseiged inside their underground lair<br>
That clan was not concerned with humans<br>
For them the threats were barbarians<br>

<p class="main">Next east to Highpass where he'd heard<br>
A soothsayer might have a helpful word<br>
But those fine gnolls they were enmeshed<br>
In the seige of a keep they couldn't best<br>

<p class="main">His final trip was down to Paw<br>
And there his plan became most flawed<br>
His brethren with their skin of white<br>
Had little feeling for his plight<br>

<p class="main">They were jealous of his skin of blue<br>
For they were outcasts for their hue<br>
This Sabretooth gnoll they would mislead<br>
And take revenge through treacherous deed<br>

<p class="main">"What your clan must do is charge the gate"<br>
"We Splitpaw gnolls will lie in wait"<br>
"When you announce their doom is near"<br>
"We'll take their guards out from the rear"<br>

<p class="main">Fippy's joy he then could not contain<br>
He broke into this glad refrain
<br>
<p class="main">"YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP AROOOO!<br>
Fippy Darkpaw's dream will come true!<br>
YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP BAAARRRK!<br>
Fippy Darkpaw will play his part!<br>
YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP GRRRRR!<br>
Gnoll victory is now assured!"<br>

<p class="main">Fippy went back with all due haste<br>
He was told his brothers would be in place<br>
"Bring your clan to Qeynos straight away"<br>
"Do not delay another day"<br>

<p class="main">Fippy did not go to his home<br>
He would sound the charge all on his own<br>
His place in his clan would be assured<br>
They'd make him chief if he gave the word!<br>

<p class="main">As Fippy approached the Qeynos gate<br>
He bellowed out, he could not wait<br>

<p class="main">"YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP AROOOO!<br>
Fippy Darkpaw will slay all of you!<br>
YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP BAAARRRK!<br>
Fippy Darkpaw has left his mark!<br>
YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP GRRRRR!<br>
Your doom is nigh, of that I'm sure!"<br>

<p class="main">Upon pronouncement of their doom<br>
The Splitpaw gnolls he expected soon<br>
As the guards approached in all their might<br>
Fippy did yip a sound of fright<br>

<p class="main">His gnoll brothers abandoned him<br>
His chance of survival seemed quite slim<br>
As he was surrounded by the knights<br>
Fippy attacked, he'd give them a fight!<br>

<p class="main">Then steel rained down upon his head<br>
And Fippy Darkpaw was quickly dead<br>
"Halt in the name of Antonicus Bayle!"<br>
Are the last words of Fippy Darkpaw's tale.
