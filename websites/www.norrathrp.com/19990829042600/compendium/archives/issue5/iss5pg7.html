<P CLASS="main">
I first landed in Freeport, on the east coast of Antonica. I found this  city to be one in which caution was very important. The slums, a dirty
ill-kempt place, was a particularly dangerous place. No sooner had I descended into this place, as it is lower then most of the city, I was attacked
without any known reason why by a desperate beggar. Luckily a guard was able to help me, allowing me to escape only partially harmed.
<P CLASS="main">
The guards, or the Freeport Militia, of this place are a dark bunch. I continue to hear rumors of corruption about these fellows. The paladins of
Marr, who have erected a grand temple, seem to hold a particular disgust for this force. I fear that at some time in the near future that a bloody
coup will take place.
<P CLASS="main">
There also seems to be a rather bad rat problem in Freeport, especially near the outside walls. I know not what brings these diseased creatures
to the surface, I can only imagine that it may be a rumored coven of necromancers, that live in the sewers.
<P CLASS="main">
I also explored a few interesting places near the city with some fellows that have become stalwart friends and adventuring companions. These
friends: Brulane, Beleric, Aryndel, Aphra, and Sinandan, have provided much needed support both physically and spiritually in my explorations
near Freeport. We have explored the sun-baked dunes of the Desert of Ro, the wilds of both East and West Commonlands, and the
underground, haunted ruins called Befallen.
<P CLASS="main">
I learned many lessons in these wondorous and unique places. The Desert brought me knowledge of the uses of the poisons of its many
inhabitants. The Desert seems to breed poison in its creatures. There  are men that have grown mad by prolonged periods in that harsh place.
We always brought much water with us, so as not to grow insane ourselves. 
<P CLASS="main">
The Commonlands, brought me knowledge of my first, all-powerful force of Norrath, the rulers of both East and West, the griffins. These
fearsome hybrids of lion and bird, are awesome in their might. I learned very quickly to keep one I to the sky and one ear to the wind, to alert
myself of their presence.
<P CLASS="main">
I will return to explore these places again, but the one I intend on scouring is the haven of undead and blasphemous souls, Befallen. This
haunted place holds much powerful evil, and I will return, as I know you would want me too, in the near future to hopefully rid those ruins of
their taint.
<P CLASS="main">
Ahhh..the cry of the mariners, the boat must be here. Soon many sailors and adventurers will fill this establishment, so I will end my message
here. I will go find the kind druid you sent and give this parchment to him to return to you. I hope you are well and soon I will write you another
letter, about 3 wonderful new friends, Drimamar, Larkee, and Valstar. Until then may Tunare bless you.
