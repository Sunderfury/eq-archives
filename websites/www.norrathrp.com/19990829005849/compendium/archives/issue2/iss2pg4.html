<P Class="main">In the ruined house he lay<br>
Chilled by night<br>
Burned by day<br>
In the ruined house he lay<br>
Eyes a-gazing skyward

<P Class="main">At his side a faithful hound<br>
Still it sat<br>
Upon the ground<br>
At his side a faithful hound<br>
To guard its dying master

<P Class="main">When evil stalked the walls about<br>
Prowling round<br>
Crying out<br>
When evil stalked the walls about<br>
The hound would still their laughter

<P Class="main">For day on day and night on night<br>
Waiting still<br>
Ne'er taking flight<br>
For day on day and night on night<br>
'Til wracked by thirst and hunger

<P Class="main">Then golden light did fill their world<br>
A cape of warmth<br>
And life unfurled<br>
Then golden light did fill their world<br>
As Tunare wove Her wonders

<P Class="main">Before Her might the ranger knelt<br>
With praise for Her<br>
Salvation dealt<br>
Before Her might the ranger knelt<br>
His blessed Goddess Tunare


<P Class="main">The hound did cry, its pain unhealed<br>
It hungered still<br>
Its bones revealed<br>
The hound did cry, its pain unhealed<br>
And looked upon its master

<P Class="main">The ranger wept and held his hound<br>
Lying still<br>
Upon the ground<br>
The ranger wept and held his hound<br>
Afraid to ask for favour

<P Class="main">But Tunare's love encloses all<br>
Both creatures great<br>
And creatures small<br>
But Tunare's love encloses all<br>
A Mother to Her children
