<p class="main">Also at the town docks I saw the ocean for the first 
time, which I stared at for several hours, when to my 
surprise I saw what is called a sailing ship.  I had 
never seen such a large boat.  These little men like 
you seem to be quite industrious.
     
<p class="main">After seeing the ship i went to talk to a fisherman 
for several hours, and he told many many stories of 
Qeynos, and also the road to Freeport.  He told me of 
a pass in the mountians where seemingly innocent 
humans camped.  He said that these fiends were 
actually evil men.  He called them assasins i think.
     
<p class="info">Let Ten Hammers show you the true path to justice.
     
<p class="info">Sinadan of Ten Hammers

<p class="main">Sinadan,
     
<p class="main">Your letter traveled far and was well received.  The Paladin guild 
system is vast and your letter traveled from the guild in Freeport
to the installation in the High Elven city of Felwithe.  There it was 
delivered to me at my position in the Lesser Faydark by an
industrious Paige and his Woodelven guide.
     
<p class="main">The guide tracked me to my current location here in the wilds of
the Lesser Faydark where I am presently traveling with a small group of
noble adventurers to rid these lands of bandits who are harming the
economy.  It seems the vile rogues have been hijacking caravans
that travel back and forth between the three major cities of Kaladim, 
Felwithe and Kelethin.  With every bandit we dispatch we discover
more and more precious cargo that they have stolen from hard working 
dwarven smithys and Elven jewelry makers. Every two or three days I
make the journey back to Felwithe to return the goods to the
various merchants.  These merchants seem quite pleased to have the goods 
returned, as they reward me handsomely with every shippment. I am 
grateful to receive these tidings as they will go a long way
towards better equiping me for the adventures I see ahead.
     
<p class="main">The Faydark is a very exciting and challenging continent.  The
thick Mallorn trees make the forest a difficult place to travel as they 
block out the light in most places and make night travel almost 
impossible at times, even for me.  I have resorted to carrying a
small lantern at night as my keen Halfelven vision is proving to be 
inadequate.
     
<p class="main">Prior to being assigned the task of clearing out the bandits here,
I was entrusted with the job of helping to clear out the infestation
of orcs in this area.  To put it bluntly, these elves have a serious
orc problem.  The orcs here (a clan known as Crushbone) are very
different from the Clan Deathfist that I often encountered in Freeport.  They
are bolder and much more organized.  They make their camps within a
stones throw of Kelethin and even have a vast stronghold within 
walking distance of the lofty Woodelven city.  For five days
straight I hunted them in the woods of the Greater Faydark and on two 
occassions I organized local adventurers into war parties that 
struck deep into their compound.  Both groups reached the steps of
the Orc Castle before we were thrown back by powerful Orc Legionairres
and Oracles.  There is much work to be done here and I intend on 
continuing my efforts against these creatures as my hatred for
their kind burns deep in my conscience.
     
<p class="main">It is this effort that is the reason for my letter.  I could use
your assistance to drive these vile Orcs from this beautiful place.  It 
seems that as soon as we have cleared one area, the next area is 
infested with their foul presence.  I am planning to make the trip 
back to Freeport in a few days and I would like to arrange a
meeting with you so we can travel back here and cure the Orc plague that 
sickens this place.  I have been traveling often with the Druid 
Elorebaen and have met a number of noble elves and dwarves whose 
passion for killing these orcs is as strong as my own.
     
<p class="main">Stay in Qeynos and I will send a plan for our rendezvous when I
arrive back to Freeport.  Until we meet, may Mithaniel Marr guide you and 
Tunare watch over you.
     
<p class="info">Many regards,
     
<p class="info">Brulane Arongrith, <br>
Paladin and Scribe of Freeport
