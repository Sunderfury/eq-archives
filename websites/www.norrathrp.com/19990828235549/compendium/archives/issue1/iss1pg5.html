<p class="main">The wind howls as a lost child to my sensitive ears. Glancing skyward, a sounds echos across the rocky cliffs. A bird? Possibly something else all together. I am reminded of the "differentness" of this place.

<p class="main">Why again did I choose to travel this way? This place of vast open skys uncrowded by my beloved, soaring mallorns. Ahhh..yes, I remember now, the War of Ro. A wonderful idea; adventure, new sites, using my healing skills for the good of others. The thought has begun to cross my mind, that just maybe this wasn't the best idea for me to follow alone.

<p class="main">Ironically enough, I seem to be lost. Which wouldn't worry me much as I have become familiar with this "state", but I feel a sense of wrong here. 

<p class="main">CRACK!!

<p class="main">Ack! By Tunare what is that?!!

<p class="main">No sooner did these words leave my lips, I felt the hair rise on the back of my neck. A flash of light exploded next to me, momentarily blinding me. I began to run, as if Innourok was my pursurer. A strange and wold fear had descended on me. I will never forget, out of the corner of my eye, a large hulking figure with a face twisted by hate. 

<p class="main">I sped towards a path in the distance, leaves and twigs flying from my tunic, as the air rushed by. No sooner did my foot touch the path, then a greenish light engulfed me. I immediately fell to the ground, my stomach clenched in knots. Heavey footsteps approached.

<p class="main">I could barely move. I called to Tunare " Mother bless me and see me safe! ". A loud crack was heard and then only darkness.

<p class="main">Much later, as I stumbled out of what the honorable dwarves of Kaladim call the Butcherblocks, I heard cries of the gods walking the earth and shouts of battles lost and won. Rubbing the large lump on my head I listened. Alas, it would seem that in exchange for my life, Tunare had witheld this gift from me. I would've loved to have seen these radiant beings with my own eyes, but even I know better then to second guess the Mother of All.
