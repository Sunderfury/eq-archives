<a name="Stories"><p class="info"><b><span>Macullok's Butterflies</b></span><br>


<P CLASS="MAIN">Macullok was a barbarian,<BR>
	Reminded me of a bear.<BR>
If you were a friend of his,<BR>
	He treated you with such care.<BR>
If one dared to cross his path,<BR>
	Or try to hurt one so dear.<BR>
He would track them down rapidly,<BR>
	And pull off both their ears.

<P CLASS="MAIN">He wandered through the woods one day,<BR>
	He could not believe his eyes.<BR>
There before him was a lovely sight,<BR>
	Of large colorful butterflies.<BR>
He decided to take one home with him,<BR>
	To his lovely little elf.<BR>
And ran into the midst of them,<BR>
	All by his little self.

<P CLASS="MAIN">At first he tried to catch one, <BR>
	And take it home alive.<BR>
Until he noticed something,<BR>
	Much to his surprise.<BR>
These were babe drakes,<BR>
	Not just butterflies.<BR>
Brandishing his sword before him,<BR>
	As they attacked him from all sides.<BR>
His goal had changed from catching one,<BR>
	To trying to stay alive.

<P CLASS="MAIN">Twenty to thirty colorful wings<BR>
	Accosted our poor friend.<BR>
He took them out one by one<BR>
	As he tried desperately to defend<BR>
Finally as he felt weak,<BR>
	From his loss of precious blood<BR>
He took out the final drake,<BR>
	And fell down in the mud.

<P CLASS="MAIN">So now our hero did trudge home,<BR>
	With trophies to present.<BR>
To his fair eleven love,<BR>
	In hopes she would consent.<BR>
To become his mate for life,<BR>
	And travel by his side.<BR>
"Silly Bear," she exclaimed at him,<BR>
	"I need no help to decide!"<BR>
A kiss and hug was her reply<BR>
	And thus the bear was tamed.<BR>
There they traveled from that point on,<BR>
With his elf to keep him sane.
