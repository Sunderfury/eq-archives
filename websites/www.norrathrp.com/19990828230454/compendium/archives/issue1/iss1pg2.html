<p class="main"><span><i>Battle of the Gods, Continued</i></span>

<P Class="main">When they arrived at Nektulos, the God of Light faced the God of hate on the Nektulos bridge, "Mithaniel stood with the halfling god, Innoruuk with the ogre god, and minions on either side," explains Shadowsmith. "We disposed of the dark elf guards quickly, and waited... and waited... "

<P Class="main">Confusion arose when Nektulos shook with the force of its inhabitants, but finally, Innoruuk was slain. Over a hundred bodies were scattered over the battleground. However, because of the confusion and discord reigning amongst the armies, Marr's children turned on their god and slaughtered him shortly after Innoruuk's death!


<P Class="main"><span> <i> Crushbone Unleashed! Continued... </i></span>

<P Class="main">Elves fought to their deaths, corpses cluttered the ground. Seeing such courage in my fellow elves, my party and I ran to aid. Crushbone, equipped with an axe that stood larger than myself, struck four to five blows to decimate a single elf, and I stood, watching the thirty-foot-tall beast in amazement. While in speechless awe at his enormity, two legionnaires piled atop me, and upon realizing the pain of the blows, I dodged out of the cave and back to Faydark.
<P Class="main">When I returned to Crushbone, the Lord of the Orcs ran back and forth smiting my fellow adventurers to the ground. I took hold of my wits, and noticing an Orc Slaver headed for me, I focused my powers on defeating the Slaver. But as I fought, a strange feeling washed over me.
<P Class="main">Then I realized that I had lost all control of myself, and I was bending to the command of the Orc Lord. The slaver continued to beat me, and I was helpless to defending myself. Crushbone puppeted me back and forth, running aimlessly through the battle zone, stopping only to try to hit my companions. Friends turned on friends against their will. This little enchanter was charmed by the Lord of the Orcs! When she became useless to him, he turned on her and pounded her to the ground until she lay, unbreathing.
<P Class="main">When I had recovered and remembered all of my spells, and had rescued my worldly items from Clan Crushbone, I heard the cries of my fellows that the Orc Lord had left his domain and had been loosed into Faydark. In defiance of the elves, Crushbone shouted his ownership of the forest. Rallos called the citizens to Arms. Word passed that the Lord had gone to Felwithe, then to Kelethin. And soon, he was back at the Crushbone entrance, with an army of elves following him. 
<P Class="main">Every one of us healed our fellows, casted and hit crushbone. Crushbone was quick to dispose of most of us, but we swarmed him like a hundred bees stinging at once. At least a hundred of us stood in the narrow entrance, wrecking our destructive forces on the monster.
<P Class="main">Finally, the Lord of the Orcs began walking to the mouth of the cave, and turned around to deal some final blows. Suddenly, he threw up his arms in the air, and the earth rumbled as the huge beast fell to the ground. From the astonished silence arose the cheers of the allied armies. The Lord of the Orcs had fallen! Crushbone was no more!
