<P CLASS="MAIN"><SPAN>L</SPAN> arkell ran from the guild house covering her face so the citizens of Qeynos would not see her tears.  For 16 years she had endured a lot of strict rules for the "sake of conformity", but this was always the hardest to accept.  The pond loomed ahead of her, away from the prying eyes of the humans.  Once she got to the banks of the pond she dropped to her knees and pulled her hat off.  Shaking, she looked into the pool to see the damage they had done.  Tears streamed anew as the face staring back had all the beautiful black hair chopped short again, to cover her ears.  Larkell had tried to grow it out long again and hide it under her cap, but her guardian had noticed.... Of course.
<P CLASS="MAIN">"I have tolerated these humans and their rules long enough, I will not tolerate it any longer."  Standing up and turning around only to look right into the guild master's stare.
"Larkell, that comment could get you killed," he scolded.  Belious Naliedin put his strong hand on her shoulder and started to lead her towards the front gates then continued in a softer voice. "I know you don't understand the reason for the rules, but you will.  But to speak of such things, when the humans you speak of have raised you, is blasphemy.  Come, we need a quiet place to talk."
<P CLASS="MAIN">Shaking in combined fear and anger, Larkell followed her master out of the gates into the creature-infested wilderness that surrounded the secure walls of Qeynos.  After walking a fair distance away from the gates he sat down with his back to the wall.  Larkell joined him as he continued. "Dear girl, you were but a mere 2 seasons old when you were brought to the guild for safe keeping.  Your mother and I had met in your homeland many years before that.  Due to the help she had given me, and the kindness she had shown to me when the other Elves shunned me, I agreed to accept the responsibility of raising you for her during the time of the Orc wars."  He turned to look into Larkell's dark green eyes and pulled a parchment from his breast pocket, then continued, "she sent this note with you and I think it should answer some of your questions."  Then he unstrapped a bag from his belt and handed it to Larkell.  She took it and looked inside, immediately she glanced up in surprise.  "Oh please child, pick up your jaw off the ground.  You are 18 seasons now and, like any other daughter, you must find your own way in life.  In the bag you will find a few days rations and a note that if shown to the guild master, of any bards guild, will get you shelter and training.  Oh and here is a sword, rusty and small as it is, it will save your life."  Larkell tried to protest but was stopped by the simple raised hand of her guardian.  "Girl, you have known for a long time that you are not from this area and that I am not your father, as much as you feel like a daughter of mine, and it is now time for you to resolve the questions you have had for all these years.  You are always welcome at my home, but I think you would be happier in your families home."  Shock ran through her and he hugged her like a father hugs his child, the first show of emotion that her guardian had ever shown towards her.  He got up and started back to the gates, yet before she could get up to join him he turned and gave her his parting information " Remember to be ever wary of those around you and know who your true friends are."  And with that he turned back towards the gates and left.  

<P CLASS="MAIN">She watched him walk away with confusion and fear jolting her with every step he took.  When he turned the corner, to pass through the gates, without so much as a glance back she knew she was truly on her own.  For 16 years she had been taught to live by human rules, and was teased and segregated because of being part elf, what was she to do now.  Just then she remembered the note that he had given her.  He did say that the note would answer a lot of questions for her.  Quickly she unrolled the parchment and started to read.  Memories of old flooded her mind as if by magic as the words transformed into her mother's musical voice.  

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>My darling Larkell, I trust you are will.  I am your mother Lark.  We are of the Kelethin wood elves.  I am a bard of the high order and your father was a druid half elf of Surefall.  I meet your father during my travels to Freeport.  He was trying to find his mother who just happened to be from our village.  He did not know the way so we decided to travel to the Tree City together.  It took us weeks to make the journey safely and once there we engaged in the good fight against the Orc's who were trying to invade our home.  His mother turned out to be a wise old woodelf of the druid order who had allowed his father to take the boy to be raised in the holy druid lands of Surefall.  After many wonderful months of being together we fell in love. </I><P CLASS="MAIN"><I>Tunare granted us with the happiness of me being with child, yet it could not have been at a worse time.  Even though the Orc's were no longer a threat your father received word that Surefall was under threat of the possible invasion by a clan of gnolls known as Blackburrow.  He knew he had to go back and to help protect the sacred home of Tunare and insisted that the child would go with him to learn the family magic.  I did not wish to lose the child that Tunare had blessed me with but I also could not leave my home.  I had never gone through to that side of the world and speed was of the essensence.  Your father had a powerful spell that could transport him and what he carried back to his home in Surefall, but the spell was not strong enough to transport two adults.  It was agreed that he would Gate with our son and if all went well they would return to get me after the battle. 

</i><P CLASS="MAIN"><I> Yet, Tunare in all her wisdom granted me with the knowledge that I carried not just a boy but also a girl.  I swore my midwife to secrecy and went through the birth in a place of my choosing.  The boy was immediately taken from me so that your father could get back to Surefall and I was left with a beautiful baby girl with eyes green as emeralds.  We had wonderful times playing in the safety of the trees as you grew to almost a full two seasons.  You did not even look like anything more than a pure woodelf. </I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>Even though you were slightly taller than most of the other children that seemed to be the only tip off that you could be a mix breed.  Your height was easily overlooked especially when it became apparent that you had the bard's magic.  And as with life, our happiness was not meant to be dear.  Weeks before we were to celebrate your second season the council convened to announce that an Orc messenger had been intercepted and that plans of a full out assault on the area was in the making.  Being a bard of the high order I was to be in command of a group of rangers and against my true desire to take you to safety I had to stay.  Still I could not risk losing you so I got in touch with an old traveling buddy of mine.  A barbarian by the name of Mead, he was interested with your safe transport to the guild master of the Antonicain  bard's located in Qeynos.  I hope to join you there once this is resolved, but I trust that you are in good hands.  Always remember that I did this because of my love for you. 
Tunare be with you my daughter.

Love always, <BR>
Lark</I>


<P CLASS="MAIN"><P CLASS="MAIN">Tears stained the parchment as Larkell now realized why she had to cut her hair to cover her ears and to wear the heeled boots to make her appear taller.  The citizens of Qeynos did not like full elves and many actually hated them, so to make it easier on her, Belious drew as much on the half-elf aspects as he could so her life would be easier here.  This revelation did not make the last 16 seasons any easier, but at least she now understood.

<P CLASS="MAIN">"I have a brother?" This hit her with the strength of an ogre's fist.  All this time interacting with half-elf druids she may have been talking with her BROTHER.  Oh why didn't this note name her father, the son was obviously not mentioned because her mother did not have time to learn of his name?  Well, it seemed pretty clear as to the direction she must take; "I must travel to Kelethin and find my mother.  I must get the name of my father and then find my brother."  She stood up and attached her provisions and sword to her belt, " and there is no better time to start than now"
<P CLASS="MAIN">Larkell started to walk towards the road when she realized she had no idea of how to get to this tree city.  "Hmm, this may prove to be quite a interesting quest."  Just then she felt the sting of a rat bite.  She jumped forward and turned to face her attacker.  The rat was HUGE; his eyes glowed with anger towards her as he lunged to bite her again.  She fell to the ground trying to get out of its way and was cut by her own sword. Feeling stupid she grabbed the sword and held it before her as she located where the rat was at now.  This time as he lunged towards her she slashed at him.  Even though she missed, so did he.  "Ah ha, friend rat, I now can defend myself." She yelled at him as he prepared to attack again.  This time her sword slashed the rat across the back and blood sprang from the fiend.  Never having trained in fighting except when she had watched some of the bard's children, it became apparent that this may be more than she could handle.  Just then the rat leaped at her again.  Her sword slashed the rat as a pain shot through her leg where the evil creature bit into it.  Larkell started to feel very weak as her precious blood started to run down her leg.  'I can not let this rodent live for such an attack' she told herself as he lunged at her again.  This time it felt as if Tunare herself was helping Larkell guide the sword into the rat.  The rat fell at her feet with a screech.  Becoming dizzy and light headed, Larkell decided (not completely of her free will) to sit exactly where she was.  Her first kill, the thought of it at first made her sick to her stomach, then pride filled her.  Just then she began to tickle as a soft blue light surrounded her.  She jumped to her feet to see what was attacking her now and realize that magic had started to heal her wounds.  Glancing around she saw her benefactor.  A tall man, taller than any she had ever seen before, started to chant again and the healing light again surrounded her.  This time she could not help but giggling from the tickling that permeated her whole being.  

<P CLASS="MAIN">"Hail little friend, you looked as if you could use a little help." The towering man walked over to sit next to her and her kill.  Larkell settled back down and stared at the man as he started to skin the rat.  "Is this your first kill little one?" he questioned and as she nodded he continued, " well then we must do this right."  He dipped his hand into the creature and pulled out the heart.  Larkell's eyes widened as he took her blade from her and pierced the organ and wiped it along the full length of her sword.  Then without hesitation he put his hand on her face to paint it with the blood of her first kill.  "There little one, a new enemy and you have slain it properly.  You must always introduce the blood of your enemies to your weapon and your skin other wise you may not recognize them the next time you meet."   He explained as if it was common knowledge, then he spoke again. "Oh my, forgive my rudeness little one, I am Kemili a shaman barbarian from Halas, and you are?"

<P CLASS="MAIN">Larkell didn't know what to say, she had heard of Barbarians from the merchants and never heard a good thing about them, then she realized they also never had a good thing to say about any thing that was not pure Human. "I am Larkell a bard woodelf from Qeynos."

<P CLASS="MAIN">His confusion showed on his face.  "How is it that you are a woodelf from Qeynos."  

<P CLASS="MAIN">She decided that she better explain herself and told him "it 'tis a long story friend, this may take a while." 

<P CLASS="MAIN">"We have time little song bird," he stated as he started to build a small fire to cook the meat on " spin your tale, BARD!"  He beamed a sincere smile at her and her first friendship was formed over a meal of rat.
