<P Class="main"><span><i>I</i></span> will summon Food/Water/Bandages for a "small" price.  For food and
water I charge a mere 5 copper each.  As for the bandages, I charge 1
Silver for 4 bandages.  I charge low prices for 2 reasons, 1) They
vanish if you leave Norrath 2) I can summon and so they are free for me.

<P Class="main"><span><i>Hello</i></span> fellow citizens of Norrath! Need a ring or necklace made?  Perhaps something with enchanted metal? I am offering my services in this area, (currently a skill level of 23 and an excellent success rate with the smaller gems)  I would be happy to combine any metal/stones you might bring.  I offer no charge for this service, just the knowledge I gain during the attempt and accept no responsibility for failed attempts.  I am currently bound to erudin but will be moving to qeynos soon.  Give me word if I can help.<br>
