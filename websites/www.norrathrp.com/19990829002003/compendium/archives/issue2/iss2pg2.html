<UL><p class="info">3/28: Studying the ways of the warrior, as Heartwood has "suggested". Near the human city of Freeport, the East Commonlands. The
group I was with consisted of the honorable paladin, Brulane, Amauklin, Joqui, Pyrate, Prefect and Dolman. Witnessed the Ruler of the
Commonlands, the griffon. A mighty force of nature which deserves much respect and caution.
<p class="info">4/1: Just witnessed an impromptu concert by the famous bard, Jythri at the Hogcaller's In in Freeport! It was incredible! What a flair for
song this gifted bard has. He preview one of his new works that will be presented soon at an official concert, it was wonderful as were the
others. 
<p class="info">4/2: Dain thal Uwen, Oliave of the Balladry Filidh of the Soerbaird, was wonderful enough to tell us an epic tale on the boat to Freeport. It
was an incredible tale! I look forward to hearing the whole tale as it is unfinished.
<p class="info">4/3: I wonderful lady of Kelethin named, Guelph was extremely helpful in the recovery of some items I had lost. She is also a druid and a
friend, I will never forget her help on this day.
<p class="info">4/4: A Teir'dal named, DVinn was communicating with the Crushbones. This does not bode well for our beautiful Faydark
<p class="info">4/7: I have begun to research the reason for my sighting of a pixie trying to bring flame to one of the great trees of Kelethin. This could be
serious trouble!

<p class="main">"Very good young Elorebaen " intones Heartwood. " Is there anything else you would like to share with me in todays lesson? "

<p class="main">" Only that as I have walked the many paths of Faydwer, I have seen that patience and a willingness for friendship is rewarded greatly. I have
seen many shout demands at others and be ignored, as it should be. On the other side of the branch I have seen those who speak in a friendly
manner, awarded with companionship and help, as it should be. One last thing has amazed me, the more I explore and talk to those familiar with
the happenings of different areas, the more I learn about Norrath and more I find my niche in this world. The more I explore and experience the
more I am grateful for Tunare's gift of my life".
