<P Class="main">I recently stumbled upon a book that expounded the beliefs of this dangerous sect. In deepest fascination I browsed it's pages, and discovered a few things of the Dismal Rage. According to the lore of the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/9656/neriak/">Church of the Firstborn</a>,the Teir'Dal are said to be the Will of Innoruuk. All other races that follow the will of Innoruuk serve the Teir'Dal. "True worship of the Father," Aedare said, "is done by dark elves. Humans are not worthy," So believed this willing servant of L'vanon, who brought me this terrible news. The goal of the Dismal Rage, servants of Teir'Dal?  To bring Norrath under the mercy of Innoruuk.

<P Class="main">
At first I desired to know how the movement was to accomplish this goal. Aedare responded lightly: "I imagine you must have insects, spiders, wasps where you come from," she paused before continuing: "To a point, these small, petty creatures cause you no grief, except a buzzing sound. And, as long as they are content to buzz, so be it. But, if they become an annoyance, if they hamper your way of life, what then?" At this point, she teases me with a slight smirk. "I doubt that there are any in the Dismal Rage who would be willing to blindly crush something that is useful. That which is not useful... that which blocks the Path of the Father, is to be
crushed like an annoying insect."

<P Class="main">I employed all efforts to remain calm as the interview progressed. Aedare began to give me warnings of dark plots. "Imagine, if you will.  The Dismal Rage claims Freeport for Innoruuk. Then, the docks of Freeport are firmly in the hands of our Lords, the Teir'dal. What a beautiful thought." Indeed, should the Teir'Dal take ownership of these docks, they will stifle the only transportation route between Antonica and Fadwer. Controlling the flow of travellers to Antonica would only be the first step in the domination of Antonica.

<P Class="main">Aedare continued: "... we have friends in the Freeport Militia." This I had long known, seeing many of the humans view me apprehensively, even dubiously as I wandered cautiously through the city. I would find Teir'Dal wandering the streets freely, and to my dismay, the guards seeming indifferent to the sight. "When the Militia has completely fallen under our sway, then the temple of the Vile Twins will be torn down, and we shall erect a monument to the Father in its place." It became evident to me that protection of the Marr Temple was Vital in keeping Freeport safe from the Dismal Rage.

<P Class="main">So, brighter ones, prepare your fortresses, keep a wary eye on the shadows, and protect your freedoms. One day, if we do not pay heed to the threats around us, Freeport will fall to slavery, and this bustling heart of Antonica will be paralyzed by the Teir'Dal.
