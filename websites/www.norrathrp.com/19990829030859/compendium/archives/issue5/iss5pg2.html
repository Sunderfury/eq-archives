<P CLASS="MAIN">Inside this message is a folded partchment with the seal of Aravs, Scribe to the Dismal Rage upon it. Breaking it open, this letter and transcript is what I found within.

<P CLASS="INFO">My lord, L'vanon,

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>Enclosed in this letter is the true and accurate accounting of each word
spoken between Aedare, a Human Shadow Knight of the Dismal Rage, and the
High Elf Pandorae, an agnostic traitor to her race and, despite her words,
as fully in the Father's service as you or I!  As the Dismal Rage's scribe,
I was the one that Aedare requested stand guard and keep track of everything
spoken.  If you could believe such a thing, the Human had the audacity to
demand that I give her a copy of this information, instead of letting me
send this directly to you!  To think that a Human has the right to contact
your Lordship at her will. Send me the word, my lord, and all further
information from the Dismal Rage shall come through me, and me alone; I can
understand better than any how the stench of humans bothers the nose of our
kind.</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>Anyway, this is the True and Accurate Account of each word spoken in the
Freeport Warehouse, beneath the docks.  Not a word has been altered;
everything is as spoken.  My words are given only when I heard some motion
that did not accompany words.  Naturally, I can tell you nothing about what
happened beyond what I could hear, since I was behind a secret door, hidden
so that this Pandorae creature could not notice me.  If any word has been
changed, then may the Father damn me to death eternal, not even allowing my
corpse to serve beautiful Neriak; or worse, damn me to be reborn as a
halfling.</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>In the name of Father Innoruuk<BR>
And the glory of the Teir'Dal,<BR>
Aravs - Scribe to the Dismal Rage<BR></I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(I cannot be sure what occurred until the two women arrived in the
warehouse, and for a while, it was difficult to hear anything.  However, I
believe that Aedare asked Pandorae if they were going to lay down their
weapons.  It is at this point that I begin my transcription.)</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  Indeed, I shall set it down, if you do so with your sword.<BR>
<B>Aedare:</B> Agreed, then.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(There was, naturally, a period of silence.  I heard Aedare sheathe her
sword, although I cannot be sure what Pandorae did with her staff.  There
was a soft "Chink".)</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B> <I>(With some surprise in her voice)</I>  Thank you.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare: </B> Complements of the Lord L'vanon.  I assure you, it is a Felwithe
import, and that my Dark Lord has no wish to. have this evening end
prematurely?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  From my homeland, I wonder how you got it?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare: </B> I have my contacts.  If you must know, it was acquired perfectly
legally, from a group of tradesmen.  <I>(There was a short pause.)</I>  No blood
was spilled.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae: </B> Thank your lord L'vanon for me, tell him I, was surprised.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare: </B> It shall be so.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(At this point, some disgusting sewer rat - I believe it was a dwarven
thief - ran by my hiding place, grunting loudly.  Forced to hold my nose
from the stench, I missed a moment of what was said.  When the disgusting
creature had moved on, I heard-)</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Do you mean Freeport in general, or this dock in particular?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae: </B> <I>(Apparently finishing a thought from previously.)</I>  That there is
a movement of some kind towards Innoruuk, and it has obviously moved past
the Nektulos gates, sitting with you.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Ah, that.  Aye.  Those who spread the Word of the Father like to
call us the Dismal Rage.  Already, much of the Militia of Freeport has come
around to our way of thinking.  Ironic, is it not?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae: </B> What is the goal of this Dismal Rage?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  We follow the Will and the Path.  What other goal do we need?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae: </B> <I>(Obviously trying to rephrase her question)</I>  To what end do you
take this goal?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:  </B>Ah.  Now that is a far more interesting question.  Near your home
city, I assume you have insects, is that correct?  Spiderlings, wasps, that
sort of thing?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  Aye, we do.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  To a point, these small, petty creatures cause you no grief, except
for a buzzing sound.  And, as long as they are content to buzz, so be it.
But, if they become an annoyance. if they hamper your way of life, what
then?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  Aside from being likened to insects, no, if these things harbor
no ill feeling towards you, as some preach in the ways of Tunare, there is
no reason to hurt them.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Ah, quite a good answer, quite safe.  And I doubt that there are
any in the Dismal Rage who would be willing to blindly crush something that
could prove useful.  That which is not useful. that which blocks the Path of
the Father. is to be crushed.  Like an annoying insect.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(Damn these blasted tunnel rats!  Another rogue-to-be runs by my hiding
place, his heavy footfalls drowning out Pandorae's next question to Aedare!
If I only had my training, I would have. but, I should not be distracted.
My apologies.)</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Let us see.  Already, we have friends in the Militia.  Oh, they do
a good job keeping the city safe, but from who?  The orcs, assuredly, who
are not part of the Father's Path.  But, when the Militia has completely
fallen under our sway, then the temples to the Vile Twins will be torn down,
and we shall erect a monument to the Father in its place.  That is, of
course, merely a beginning.  But, it is a noble goal.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  The temple of the Vile twins?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Oh, I'm sorry.  The Marrs.  The whore and the fool.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(I could hear her suddenly clear her throat, and then mutter something. I
couldn't quite hear what it was, but it was something about being polite.)</I>
<P CLASS="MAIN"><b>Aedare: </B> My apologies.  I should not have referred to them that way.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>I am not sure what exactly was said, since, although it was quite a loud
exclamation on Pandorae's part, anger does little to assist in clarity.
However, Aedare was not pleased by it.)</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Misguided.  Father help me, I will forgive that for now.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  How many follow the teachings of the Dismal Rage?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare: </B> The Dismal Rage is legion.  We are the true rulers of Freeport.
You could no more count our numbers than you could count the hairs on your
Goddess's head.  If there is a shadow in Freeport, we are there.  Is that a
sufficient answer for you?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  No, when my people are in danger, this does not satisfy me.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(I heard, at this point, the sounds of footfalls, back and forth.  I assume
that Pandorae was the one pacing, although I cannot be certain.)</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  You fear warms my heart.  Thank you for your generosity.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  I do not fear easily.  I would call it a different emotion, but
my dignity will keep me from displaying it further.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare: </B> Imagine, if you will.  The Dismal Rage claims Freeport for
Innoruuk.  Then, the docks of Freeport are firmly in the hands of our lords,
the Teir'dal.  What a beautiful thought.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  Do you hold gatherings to preach these values and spread them?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  The members of the Dismal Rage meet, yes.  But the true worship of
the Father is done by the Dark Elves, in their temples.  We are not of the
Blood; we are not worthy enough to do a True Mass.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  Interesting. You would believe a philosophy that pits you beneath
the expounders of said philosophy?  <I>(A brief silence.) </I> What of the High
Elves, the true form of these dark elves, who were gnarled and twisted in
mockery, what is the church view on this race?

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(I will admit that, at this point, the conversation travels quickly.
Answers to questions posed earlier are suddenly brought up.  I simply write
the words exactly as they were spoken.)</i>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  The Dark Elves are the beloved of Innoruuk.  We are simply his
servants.  That makes us their servants.  Maybe I don't understand the
question.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  I cannot understand how anyone would willingly stoop to service
of another race, a form of slavery.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Gnarled and twisted?  You describe the Teir'dal's beauty strangely.
The High Elves are the broken, the damages, those that Innoruuk left behind.
They will serve, or they will be destroyed.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(I heard Pandorae chuckle, although I cannot be sure to what.)</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Slavery.  An odd way to put it.  The Scorned and the Beaten, they
are truly slaves.  One can have a master, and still be treated as almost an
equal by that master, as long as one is true to the Father.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  I suppose I shouldn't debate truth with you, as I am clear on my
truths.  I only discuss this matter of you to have a platform by which to
expose the corruption that is taking place.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Do you not serve your goddess, Tunare?  Are you her slave?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  Indeed not, I serve no god, no elf, no being in Norrath.  It is
an illusion, you see.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Ah, good.  I do despise hypocrisy.  The High Elves often spout
similar verses, and then pray to Tunare for guidance.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(Please forgive me a moment; I am going to transpose one sentence, so that
it makes more sense.  I pray that neither you nor the Father will punish me
for this alteration to order which ensures that the flow of the conversation
makes sense.)</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Anyway, what you call corruption is merely the natural way of
things.  Order.  A path, instead of chaos.  An end to the indiscriminate
infighting, as all are brought together under One House.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  Innoruuk may have created the dark ones, but I can be one if I so
choose.  
<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(This is the sentence I moved - It was spoken to be part of
Pandorae's comment about the rulers of Norrath being an illusion.  However,
Aedare's religious fervor kept her speaking about the "Corruption" despite
Pandorae's attempt to change the subject.)</i>
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Please feel free to try and do so.  Sneak into Neriak, as you wish,
wearing what guise you wish.  If the illusion falters, you will be the one
who is. no longer real.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(I heard both women laugh at this point, although probably for different
reasons.)</I>

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  Perhaps one day I will, and I will tell you all about it.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  It would be fascinating to see.  Perhaps you will like what you
see, and welcome more than just the form of the Dark Elves.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  You are a very interesting creature, I must admit.  This has been
very entertaining.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  And you have been quite entertaining as well.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae: </B> I serve to entertain.  Quite honestly. <I>(A short pause.)</I>  Why do
you choose to follow Innoruuk?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare: </B> Ah, the age old question.  You seem to be quite wise for a bro. a,
er, high elf.  Why do you think I follow the Father?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae: </B> That I cannot understand, which is why I ask.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Very well.  In brief, my father was a High Priest of Mithaniel, my
mother a member of Erolissi's clergy.  I was raised to follow in their
footsteps.  However, I decided to find out what path I would be forced to
follow, and what options I had.  I was able to research a great deal on the
Marrs, on Tunare. all the, shall we say, "Approved" deities.  It was
difficult to find information on other paths.  I met a dark elf who was
willing to sneak books out of Neriak's library.  I judged the gods and found
them all false.  Except Innoruuk.  With Innoruuk, there is order.  There is
a way.  Every other god preaches "Free Will."  Chaos.  That, in brief, is
why I follow the Father.  Nothing more than understanding the truth.
Surprised?  Most people are.  They assume I was beaten as a child, raised in
poverty, blah, blah, blah.  And I am what they truly fear.  I chose Innoruuk
's Order, because of the free will they shoved down my throat.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  That is such a noble ideal, it is hard to see in such a context.
My people are all about discovering the truth.  There is not truth, dear,
don't get trapped in a lie.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  By "Your People", do you mean the High Elves?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  I speak not from my people, I speak from myself.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare: </B> Ah.  It's just that you mentioned how your people are all about
discovering the truth?  I assume you mean your. publication?  Is that the
proper word?
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  But I am still obligated to expose this, to the waiting world, so
that they may be amply prepared.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare: </B> Yes.  You may expose this, so they will continue to hide books; so
that they will continue to look in shadows, when there is nothing there.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  My people, the elves, are determined to find truths, theirs is a
noble plight, indeed, but I fear I don't always fit in.  I have played with
illusion my whole life, it has changed my way of thinking.  <I>(Short pause:
probably in response to the shadow reference.) </I> I hope there is nothing
there.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Print my tale, so people know that those who follow Innoruuk will
not allow anything to stand in our way, and that the Dark Elves will lead
those of us who wait to be their blades.  I doubt you will teach anyone
anything new.  <I>(Loud, cheerful laugh.)</I>  Perhaps children will see me and
wish to grow up to be just like me!
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  I will never glorify your cause.  It shall appear as what it is.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Have no doubt. we will train them well, we in the Dismal Rage.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae: </B> I do think you believe that, and I feel sorry for you.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare: </B> You will print what I have said, and you will glorify our cause.
Or, you will twist my words, and you will be destroying truth quicker than
any of the Dismal Rage ever could.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  I must take my leave now and fulfill my duties.  I only print the
truth, as it is presented to me, there is no other truth.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Again, thank you for your time.  And remember, dear, dear Pandorae.
Truth is a double-edged sword.  May Innoruuk guide your path, m'lady.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  Thank you kindly for the Wine, I have missed home dearly.
Hopefully you will rediscover yours, mistress.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare:</B>  Another bottle for your journey to Queynos.  And fear not:  I sleep
well at night, knowing that my path is set.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  Thank you again, stranger, you are much kinder than I
anticipated.  So be it, I can only hope.  Safe journeys to you, Aedare.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Aedare: </B> And you.
<P CLASS="MAIN"><B>Pandorae:</B>  I must return to the city of Queynos, have a good day.

<P CLASS="MAIN"><I>(With those words, I heard magic spoken, and a great spell was cast.
Shortly afterwards, Aedare came through the secret door, and, although I was
hidden, looked straight at me.  "Well?" she asked.  "Every word," I,
admittedly, lied, but why do we Teir'dal need to respect the Humans?  She
smiled.  "It will be interesting, will it not?  Will she print the whole
truth, or just that which she wishes the world to see?  Ah, well, it matters
little.  I report to L'vanon.  Do not misunderstand this, Aravs - that
document is your only priority.  Copy it immediately; and make sure you
allow me to see it before it's sent to Lord L'vanon."
Ah, these humans.  They claim to know their place, and yet they claim to
know your will as well.)
