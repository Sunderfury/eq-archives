Soerbaird Concert-Theater of the Tranquil, Freeport, April 25th
<P Class="info"> Review by Elorebaen
<P Class="main">
A masterful performance by a truly dedicated guild, the Soerbaird. Many who were in attendance were mezmerized by these performers, as the bards coaxed our emotions to the surface. In times like these, where the many races of this melting pot we call Freeport, join together in a time of rest for the sole enjoyment of art, I feel there is indeed help for this human city.
<P Class="main">
Other then a few disruptors, namely Serine and Rianosyrhianni, the concert went very smoothly. Jythri was even offering rewards for riddle answering as the next acts prepared themselves. Not only were the pieces and performances amazing, but the Soerbaird were very organized in their presentation.

Overall an incredible experience! You can bet that as I walk the desert  of Ro, I hear Alindria. When I walk the Commonlands I can't help but count the giants I see and hum the tune. In Karana I'll imagine the impossible lovers, and in Kaladim I'll remember the dwarvish smiths. As I walk the stone streets of Freeport, you may catch me doing a little jig, mumbling something about a Yellow Beetle.

<P Class="info"> Review by Aphra

<p class="main">This young bard skipped into the concert not a moment too soon, when she discovered Jythri on the stage introducing the troupe. Dain was the first to play, a half-elf with a greying head of hair, wisdom and merriment in his eyes. His amusing jig, "Orcish Song of the Damned" evoked a roar of laughter from the audience.  After hearing of his brave party confronting the orcish threat, we were suddenly met with: "And our Fearless leader stood and wet his pants." This is only a sample of the self-ridiculing humour of this melody, and one of the reasons it was so enjoyable.

<p class="main">The second song of the eve was by Waji, a petite wood elf, and Soerbaird's resident historian. This song was a light-hearted praise of the Dwarvish Smiths, with a clever final line which changed the entire direction of these rhymes. I am sure I saw the dwarves in the audience, grinning silly with pride in their trades, turn a bit red upon hearing it. However, that might have been from the ale that made its rounds.

<p class="main">Following was Tionne, with a mournful song of a lost love, and transported the crowd to her original home in Fadwer. The melencholy wood elf sang with tears in her eyes of a husband slain by Ambassador D'Vinn of the Crushbone Legions. Her song sent more than one person in the audience to tears, and set the mood for Dain's telling of the tragedy of Ingela and Estegorn. By the end of these two performances, there was hardly a dry eye in the crowd. However, there were several dry bottles and jugs.

<p class="main">Finally, Jythri climbed the stage to a very anxious audience. His lyrics played on our desire for restitution, with "Alindria and Dorn B'Dynn."  Having learned of Abassador D'Vinn's unpardonable acts, hearing of the band of brave warriors out to conquer his brother  Teir'dal brought a real sense of satisfaction to the evening. (Additionally, if you say "D'Vinn" and "B'Dynn" several times quickly, you will almost certainly get them confused). The crowd was having so much fun at this point, that they begged an encore from Jythri, just as Dharmik De'Vise stepped from the shadows to procure a splash of light over the stage. Levitating above the audience, Jythri sang a lively new song of the Yellow Beetle, while the audience joined in, clapping and dancing. He ended with the popular song of the six giants. By this time there were more than a few people swaying back and forth, and stumbling to stand upright. A few hiccuping audience members encouraged everyone to join them at the taverns.

<p class="main">The evening was a great success, despite a few interruptions from the audience. The talent of the night was spectacular, and I look forward to the next Soerbaird concert.
