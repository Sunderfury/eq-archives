Long before you were hatched, the Hierophants of Cabilis detected the mana surging within your life force and thus your path was chosen for you.  Now that you have reached the season of rebirth you have been summoned to the infamous Tower of Death.  It is there that you shall be introduced to the dark circle of magic known as necromancy. The scholars of the temple shall welcome you into the Brood of Kotiz to begin your studies.  Most Iksar residents fear and respect the Brood of Kotiz.  The rumors of experiments performed on fellow Iksar run rampant.  All other Iksar castes have respect for the Brood.  Beware of other races as well as outsiders from abroad.
