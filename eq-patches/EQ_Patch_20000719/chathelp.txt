GUILD CREATION

If you decide that none of the existing guilds are quite what you are looking for, you may found your own guild. In order to establish your guild you must have an acceptable name, charter, and a membership of 10 players who wish to form this guild. 

The following process needs to be followed to gain approval for you guild:

1.The person who is to be the leader of the guild must enter the chat server and issue the #makeguild command. This will create a private guild channel. The name of the guild should be used as the name of the channel, although this name can be edited later during the creation process.

2.Once the channel has been created, the guild leader needs to invite the members of his guild into the channel. To do this he needs to tell the guild members the name of the channel and the password for access.

3.Once a total of 10 members are in the channel and have issued the #guildapprove command, the guild leader can then issue the #makeguild command. This will move the guild leader to the guild creation screen. 

4.In the guild creation screen, the guild leader needs to enter a summary of the guild’s charter. This summary should focus on the guild’s role in Norrath and the goals it will pursue. Details of the internal working of your guild need not be included. You may also edit your guild’s name in this screen. Once completed, hit FINISH and the guild will be submitted for approval.

5.The leader of the guild may check the status of the guild by activating the GUILDS button from chat. If the status of the guild indicates a need for revision, the guild leader should select his guild and hit the EDIT button. Comments regarding the nature of the needed revision appear at the bottom of the guild creation screen.
The guild leader can edit the charter and the guild name as needed and hit the FINISH button to resubmit the guild for approval. IMPORTANT: If the leader is only viewing the revisions needed, hit CANCEL to exit this screen. If the leader hits FINISH the guild will be resubmitted for approval and the leader will be unable to re-enter the guild creation/edit screen.

6.Once the name and charter have been approved, the guild leader will be notified via email that the guild is ready to be created. Please verify that your email is correct in our files by going to account:change account:edit registration from the login screen.

7.Once the guild leader has received notification that the guild has been approved, it is his responsibility to petition and meet the GM of his server between 2pm and 11pm P.S.T. to complete the guild creation process.
